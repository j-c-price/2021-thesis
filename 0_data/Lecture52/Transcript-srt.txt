KEN NAKAYAMA: The
social mind, let

9
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,933
me see if I can just go
through these slides here.

10
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,000
One might ask the
question on the origin

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,775
of human intelligence.

12
00:00:31,775 --> 00:00:33,900
OK, I just want to give a
little bit of background.

13
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,360
Nancy summarized my
career very nicely.

14
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,920
I started out recording
from retinal ganglion cells

15
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,930
and animals.

16
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,770
That was a very long time ago.

17
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,440
And I was kind of
into reductionism,

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,520
trying to understand how retinal
ganglion cells determined

19
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,670
how we see certain
psychophysical phenomenon.

20
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,047
So what am I doing
here talking about some

21
00:00:53,047 --> 00:00:54,130
of that social processing?

22
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,760
Well, it's been a long
time ago, so in your career

23
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,210
you do different things.

24
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,850
But as I'll say in
a moment, I happened

25
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,310
to read an interesting paper.

26
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,220
I was in the University of
Tokyo library kind of bored

27
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,130
and I found a book.

28
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,280
And I found an article,
which I'll talk about that.

29
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,890
Didn't change my life,
exactly, but it reoriented me

30
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,280
towards this social processing.

31
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,950
And you'll see there's many
different ways of studying.

32
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,530
I think the realization
that social processing

33
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,860
and the human mind are
really very inextricably

34
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,880
connected opens the door
for kinds of investigations

35
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,310
that I think are sort of really
open-ended and somewhat limited

36
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,960
just by your imagination.

37
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,740
So I sort of
encourage some of you

38
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,260
with that bent to
think about this.

39
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,680
Since I study vision I
will just talk a little bit

40
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,020
about the visual
system as a preamble.

41
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,900
And I was studying vision
about 50 years ago.

42
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,570
And I think I was sleeping
for about 10 years.

43
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,859
And all of a sudden I found
out something interesting.

44
00:01:54,859 --> 00:01:56,400
Here's a picture of
the visual system

45
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,460
when I started graduate school.

46
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,900
There was the motor system,
the somatosensory system,

47
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,280
coupled sensory system.

48
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,980
And vision was that
area 17 V1 in the cortex

49
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,084
I think I slept a
little bit and all

50
00:02:08,084 --> 00:02:11,880
of a sudden I woke up and
oops, little bit past 1970.

51
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,730
Almost the whole half of the
brain in the back and the front

52
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,500
was devoted to vision.

53
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,520
You probably had
lectures by that.

54
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,259
And so I think that's really an
important fact because the fact

55
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:23,550
that the brain is very visual--

56
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,360
I mean, that's human.

57
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,700
So maybe in mice it
might be different,

58
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,991
they may be it's old fashioned,
or something like that.

59
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:29,880
But for primates I think
it's very important.

60
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,010
You probably learned about
the different systems.

61
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,551
That the posterior
part of the brain.

62
00:02:33,551 --> 00:02:36,030
There's a lot of anterior parts.

63
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:40,470
David Marr said, anybody
heard of David Marr?

64
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:44,220
OK, David Marr said vision,
where is what by looking,

65
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,300
what is where by looking?

66
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,430
I just want to say it's
way, way more than that.

67
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,250
The visual system-- I mean,
if vision's half the brain,

68
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,129
that's just a
pretty, puny problem.

69
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:53,670
So we have to think
of all the things

70
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,920
that the visual system might do.

71
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,503
And we really haven't
thought of them.

72
00:02:56,503 --> 00:02:58,630
Well here's some more
pictures of a visual system.

73
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:03,017
So, it's a little bit like, it
started over here on the west

74
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:03,683
and you go east.

75
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,760
It's sort of like
Russia going all the way

76
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,980
to the Pacific Ocean.

77
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,600
Vision system really expand.

78
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,380
I think it's kind of
slowed down recently.

79
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,890
I would just say the visual
system is very big in primates.

80
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:21,870
And if it's half
the brain, well all

81
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,446
the other stuff, like
greed, sex, power, music,

82
00:03:24,446 --> 00:03:25,320
all that other stuff.

83
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,480
It's about the same.

84
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,604
So, that means that we just
don't really understand.

85
00:03:30,604 --> 00:03:32,520
That's a lot of stuff
over there on the right.

86
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,610
That means, on the left,
we don't know squat.

87
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,080
So just have that
in mind, there's

88
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,054
plenty for you to do
as young scientists.

89
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:40,720
So I don't know.

90
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,660
It must be--

91
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,760
This is a very tiny list.

92
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,650
It's lots of things.

93
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,962
It's David Marr kind of thing.

94
00:03:45,962 --> 00:03:46,920
So it's more than that.

95
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,140
I'm going to talk about
visual motor control.

96
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,130
I'm a psychologist.

97
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:58,080
For some reason, I
think a lot of our--

98
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,260
Roger Sperry said 70 years
ago that the ultimate arbiter

99
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,900
of your mind is action.

100
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,260
I mean, if you don't do
something-- if we can have--

101
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,890
I mean, I studied
perception most of my life,

102
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,240
but if you don't do
something, you're

103
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,531
not going to pass your genes
on to the next generation.

104
00:04:14,531 --> 00:04:15,540
So action is it.

105
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,529
Psychologists, they don't
study action at all.

106
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:19,029
That's like, they've
forgotten that.

107
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:22,044
So I just like to put
a plug-in for action.

108
00:04:22,044 --> 00:04:23,460
There's people who
study the motor

109
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,200
system that are kind of picky.

110
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,375
So and even if they are, and
don't let you into the field,

111
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:29,250
it's important field.

112
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,890
I think you should
push your way in.

113
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,500
I think it's extremely
important for navigation.

114
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,820
Most animals live in a
widely extended space.

115
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,710
They know how to go
home quickly if they're

116
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,090
trouble and things like that.

117
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,610
I'll talk a little bit about
some kind of animals like that.

118
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:49,100
The range of area that animals
go over is astonishing.

119
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,110
And so I think the understanding
of animals in their natural

120
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:54,710
environment, there's
lots of work on it,

121
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,960
but I think it's-- a lot
of it's quite mysterious.

122
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,600
But I'm just going to talk
mostly about social perception.

123
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,366
And this is the paper
I read a long time ago.

124
00:05:03,366 --> 00:05:04,240
I never met this guy.

125
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,790
His name is Nick Humphrey.

126
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:09,365
And he wrote this paper, I
don't know, maybe 30 years ago,

127
00:05:09,365 --> 00:05:11,610
and I just happened
to come upon it.

128
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,430
And it was in a book.

129
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,510
And he said-- he
was not very nice.

130
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,840
He said, experimental
psychology in Britain

131
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,750
have tended to regard social
psychology as a poor country

132
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,670
cousin of their subject.

133
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,740
So basically, he
was putting down--

134
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,839
but he really wasn't
because he really

135
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:28,880
said something different.

136
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,830
He said, wait a second.

137
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,615
And he sort of turned
psychology upside down.

138
00:05:33,615 --> 00:05:37,410
And he said, you know, actually,
the social part of intelligence

139
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,120
is the thing that
drives everything else.

140
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,578
I mean, he might
be overstating it,

141
00:05:40,578 --> 00:05:41,960
but let's see what
he says, here.

142
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,140
Oh, I'll come back
to that in a minute.

143
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,780
The intellectual
faculties of primates

144
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,080
have evolved as an adaptation
of complexity of social living.

145
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,000
For better or worse,
styles of thinking which

146
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,450
are primarily suited to
social problem- solving

147
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,380
color the behavior of
man and other primates

148
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,005
even towards the
inanimate world.

149
00:05:57,005 --> 00:05:59,130
So he's sort of making the
implication when I said,

150
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,924
where does
intelligence come from?

151
00:06:00,924 --> 00:06:02,340
One of the sources
of intelligence

152
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,980
are the nature of
the social world.

153
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,150
And it's a quite a
complicated world here,

154
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,420
because this guy, Dunbar.

155
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,590
You've heard of this guy.

156
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,970
He sort of-- I'm not sure
this is a really good study,

157
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:14,220
but what he did was he made--

158
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,679
he got the size of the cortex
of lots of different primates

159
00:06:16,679 --> 00:06:18,095
and he made some
kind of estimate.

160
00:06:18,095 --> 00:06:19,530
I have no idea how he did this.

161
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,912
How many animals
were in their troop.

162
00:06:21,912 --> 00:06:23,370
But you can sort
of imagine, if you

163
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,890
have a different social
group, it's not just--

164
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:28,590
it doesn't just go up by N.
Because let's say, you know,

165
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,822
it's not just how many
people you have to deal with.

166
00:06:30,822 --> 00:06:32,280
Those people deal
with other people

167
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,060
and they might be
plotting against you.

168
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,840
So in other words, the number of
permutations of social behavior

169
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,340
really--

170
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,830
I mean, it's only
one other person,

171
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,910
it's not too complicated.

172
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,840
As you get like six,
two people might

173
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,300
be plotting against the
third one over there.

174
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,390
All kinds of possible
things happen.

175
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:50,070
And as some of
the primatologist,

176
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,590
if you read some
of the accounts,

177
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:55,530
there's planned murders of all
kinds of people in the top.

178
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:59,580
It really looks a little
bit like the Medici's back

179
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,500
in the Machiavellian
intelligence.

180
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,711
Doesn't sound so weird.

181
00:07:02,711 --> 00:07:03,210
OK.

182
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:06,600
So basically, the idea
is that intelligence--

183
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,840
we have to think of intelligence
in the social world.

184
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,470
I'm just scratching
the surface here.

185
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,740
So let me just talk a
little bit about prediction.

186
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,820
That's kind of what we think
one of the hallmarks of science

187
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,260
is, prediction, right?

188
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:23,120
So what are-- in what
area is prediction better?

189
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,840
Any thoughts.

190
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,416
Suppose I took a rock and
threw it down the mountainside.

191
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,540
I couldn't do squat, right?

192
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,040
I mean--

193
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,402
AUDIENCE: Well, you could
do all the measuring, right?

194
00:07:33,402 --> 00:07:35,370
PROFESSOR: Yeah, but nobody's
going to do that, right?

195
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,745
AUDIENCE: That's
what I'm saying.

196
00:07:36,745 --> 00:07:38,490
PROFESSOR: OK.

197
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:42,490
Biology, I mean, we
know-- for example,

198
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:46,242
we know that behavior of
atoms, we can't really

199
00:07:46,242 --> 00:07:48,450
predict the behavior of
atoms over long trajectories,

200
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:51,640
but we can show that, you
know, at a certain date,

201
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,180
maybe next year, at Woods Hall,
people from all over the world,

202
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,110
including Nancy, are going to
show up at 9 o'clock, here.

203
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,010
We can predict that.

204
00:08:01,886 --> 00:08:06,250
And we can predict things
like my alarm clock

205
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,810
is going to go off tomorrow at
a certain time because I set it.

206
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:12,800
So what I'm trying
to talk about is

207
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,680
kind of a point that Dan Dennett
made, who is a philosopher.

208
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,580
Who, I think, has really made
really seminal contributions,

209
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,730
at least to my understanding
of psychology to a large extent

210
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:26,167
because he really talks
about explaining things

211
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:27,000
at different levels.

212
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,800
This is another--

213
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,960
I started out as a
reductionist in a sense,

214
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,880
but let me just give you, give
you a sort of a thought, here.

215
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,039
Have you ever noticed
that when the moon is

216
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,460
setting over the Western
sky, it's the new moon.

217
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,729
It sometimes seems
kind of the whole moon

218
00:08:46,729 --> 00:08:48,270
seems to be illuminated
a little bit.

219
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,853
It's not, it's not
just that crescent.

220
00:08:49,853 --> 00:08:53,311
If you think of the, if
you think of the sun,

221
00:08:53,311 --> 00:08:54,810
it should only be
a little crescent.

222
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:58,110
So why do you see the rest
of the moon filled in?

223
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:01,140
Well, there's the possibility
that the sun reflecting off

224
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,230
the earth, which then sends
light back to the moon.

225
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,220
That's an explanation.

226
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,050
Do we need to know
about photons?

227
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,581
Do we need to know about
duality of waves and particles?

228
00:09:09,581 --> 00:09:10,080
No.

229
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,010
That's an explanation.

230
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,330
That's all I'm trying to say.

231
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,580
Some explanations are
pretty darn simple.

232
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,800
And in science, I
think we're looking

233
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,870
for any fun, interesting
explanation we can find.

234
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:23,090
So I think Dennett has
nailed it to some extent.

235
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:23,590
OK.

236
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:30,660
So he basically has three
levels for predicting behavior.

237
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,770
The physical stance.

238
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,050
I mean, if we have ideal
situation of Galileo dropping

239
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,550
his balls as a
flight that, assuming

240
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,260
there's no resistance
to air and stuff

241
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,320
like that, we can
make nice predictions.

242
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,162
Biology and engineering, we know
that you know, seven minutes,

243
00:09:43,162 --> 00:09:45,120
the coffee is going to
be ready, because that's

244
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,170
what it was designed for.

245
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,020
But then he's got something
called intentional stance,

246
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:53,490
which is in order to really
understand what people are

247
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,432
going to do,
Churchland would say,

248
00:09:55,432 --> 00:09:57,390
well, we go in to look
at their nervous system.

249
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,440
We record from their
neurons and stuff like that.

250
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,190
But Dennett would say,
no, we can't really

251
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,240
use the physics thing or
even design, we just use

252
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,900
some other heuristic,
which is very explanatory,

253
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,820
what people desire and
what their beliefs are.

254
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,289
If we know that, we
really can understand

255
00:10:11,289 --> 00:10:12,330
what they're going to do.

256
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:15,420
And of course, your grandma knew
that or your great grandmother

257
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,290
knew that as well.

258
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:19,690
So but these are really great
ways to understand people.

259
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,660
And so I think
that we can't just

260
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,310
turn our backs to these things.

261
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,555
And I think Dennett--

262
00:10:24,555 --> 00:10:26,680
the question is, and we
might come back to the end.

263
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,632
What's the sort
of scientific sort

264
00:10:30,632 --> 00:10:33,397
of status of some those
types of explanations.

265
00:10:33,397 --> 00:10:34,230
Are they scientific?

266
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,938
Or what are they?

267
00:10:34,938 --> 00:10:37,420
Maybe if we have time,
we can talk about that.

268
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,970
OK.

269
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,910
I'll skip that part, here.

270
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,920
So I sort of feel,
just as-- what

271
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,620
I'm saying is it's a non-
reductionistic way of looking

272
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,161
at thing-- you should
open your mind.

273
00:10:48,161 --> 00:10:51,140
And actually, CBMM or
brains, minds, and machines

274
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,010
is kind of your kind
of condition to that

275
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,968
because some people come
from computer science.

276
00:10:54,968 --> 00:10:57,030
I mean, you can't really
understand a computer

277
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,530
in terms of atoms and molecules.

278
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,321
You really can only
understand the computer

279
00:11:00,321 --> 00:11:02,070
at some kind of a higher level.

280
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:04,800
So I'm just telling
you, that's fine.

281
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,710
If you're a neuroscientist and
want to reduce it to synapses,

282
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:10,950
things like at, good try, but
it might be difficult to do.

283
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:14,212
There are many other
valid things to do.

284
00:11:14,212 --> 00:11:15,420
But one of the things to do--

285
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,600
let's just examine some things
about them and explore them.

286
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,390
I think, as I say, there's
so many possible things

287
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,350
in this realm.

288
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:25,330
Doing anything, I mean, people
have all kinds of principles.

289
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:29,280
My approach in the area,
this kind of area of science,

290
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,270
or any science that I've
done, is to develop new tools,

291
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,690
and then helps you explore.

292
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:35,190
OK.

293
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:38,310
So there's lots of
things that humans do.

294
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:40,950
But what I want to stress in
the first part of this talk

295
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:45,030
is that our human social
behavior is really not

296
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,110
unique in many ways.

297
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,068
There are very, there
are very important things

298
00:11:48,068 --> 00:11:49,415
that animals do.

299
00:11:49,415 --> 00:11:51,390
And I'll talk
about them shortly.

300
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,650
Animals, really are very social.

301
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,530
There are certain
animals like octopus,

302
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:58,230
apparently is not very
intelligent, not very social,

303
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,610
but by and large many
animals are very social.

304
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,580
Doesn't explain
everything but it's--

305
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:05,140
I think we share
some core things.

306
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,010
And if we can understand some
of the behavior of animals

307
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:11,490
or why they're social and how
their social mechanisms work,

308
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,170
I think we have a treasure.

309
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:16,920
So the area of animal behavior
is very underfunded area

310
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,544
right now.

311
00:12:17,544 --> 00:12:18,210
I sort of feel--

312
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,490
I just happen to like
to watch nature videos.

313
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,990
And I'll show you
a few, you'll have

314
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,610
to indulge me a few of these.

315
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,530
But I sort of feel
these can be more

316
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,690
important than
careful psychophysics

317
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,790
because I think they
open your mind to things

318
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,630
that you may not
have thought about.

319
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:36,071
So I'm a kind of
devoté of these things.

320
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:36,570
OK.

321
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:40,197
So do animals have an
intentional stance, etc.,

322
00:12:40,197 --> 00:12:41,280
kinds of things like that?

323
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,580
We don't know.

324
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:46,255
Here's a fun video I think
maybe half of the audience

325
00:12:46,255 --> 00:12:47,130
have seen this video.

326
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:49,230
And maybe I'll show
the whole thing

327
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,790
because I think we have time.

328
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,330
It was taken just by chance.

329
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,300
I think it's been
a TV program now.

330
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,820
And I think it's got
like 50 million viewers.

331
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,136
It's about different kinds
of animals interacting,

332
00:12:59,136 --> 00:13:00,430
their social behavior.

333
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:03,720
It's about animals that you
do not think are that smart

334
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,900
and things like that.

335
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,579
Ungulates.

336
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:06,120
I don't know.

337
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,786
I don't know what
buffaloes are exactly,

338
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:10,980
but we've never thought
of them as highly

339
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,690
intelligent or social.

340
00:13:24,765 --> 00:13:27,800
AUDIENCE: That is
a huge buffalo.

341
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,285
AUDIENCE: That's a huge buffalo.

342
00:13:29,285 --> 00:13:30,720
AUDIENCE: That's a huge buffalo.

343
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:39,540
AUDIENCE: I love this.

344
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,010
AUDIENCE: Is it little?

345
00:13:46,504 --> 00:13:47,670
AUDIENCE: They're crouching.

346
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,966
AUDIENCE: She's crouching.

347
00:14:09,798 --> 00:14:11,286
AUDIENCE: She's
going to get eaten.

00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:29,138
AUDIENCE: Oh, my god.

00:14:29,138 --> 00:14:29,638
Oh, my god.

00:14:29,638 --> 00:14:33,110
[INAUDIBLE] Oh, she's going
for him, she's going for him,

352
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,598
she's going for him.

353
00:14:34,598 --> 00:14:36,086
She got him.

354
00:14:36,086 --> 00:14:37,030
AUDIENCE: Jeez.

355
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:37,946
AUDIENCE: Oh, she did.

356
00:14:37,946 --> 00:14:41,046
She got him.

357
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:41,790
AUDIENCE: Ladies.

00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:42,706
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

AUDIENCE: No, the
lions have won.

360
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:47,324
AUDIENCE: Yeah, but look
at all those buffalo.

361
00:14:53,312 --> 00:14:57,304
AUDIENCE: --Buffalo down.

362
00:14:57,304 --> 00:14:59,799
AUDIENCE: They're like,
go and try chase the lion,

363
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,795
but I think they're too late.

364
00:15:05,787 --> 00:15:08,282
AUDIENCE: They're going
to chase [INAUDIBLE]..

365
00:15:12,274 --> 00:15:14,270
AUDIENCE: Look at
the teeth, Jay.

366
00:15:17,264 --> 00:15:19,260
AUDIENCE: You're too late.

367
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,757
You're too late.

368
00:15:28,741 --> 00:15:31,170
AUDIENCE: I think because he
cannot believe what's going

369
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:31,669
here.

370
00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:33,750
There's a big barrier
between lions, crocodiles,

371
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,200
and buffaloes.

372
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,670
AUDIENCE: Look at them all.

373
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,580
AUDIENCE: Whoa.

374
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,165
AUDIENCE: He swatted at
him and kicked at him.

375
00:15:46,165 --> 00:15:47,482
He's kicking at him, look.

376
00:15:47,482 --> 00:15:48,958
He's kicking at him.

377
00:15:54,862 --> 00:15:58,160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] I
mean, buffaloes is basically

378
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,785
used to [INAUDIBLE].

379
00:16:00,785 --> 00:16:02,338
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

380
00:16:02,338 --> 00:16:05,006
AUDIENCE: And in
deed, [INAUDIBLE]..

381
00:16:10,352 --> 00:16:14,290
AUDIENCE: Oooh, they
got him surrounded.

382
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,858
AUDIENCE: And that one's--

383
00:16:15,858 --> 00:16:18,822
AUDIENCE: Ooh.

384
00:16:18,822 --> 00:16:22,280
AUDIENCE: Chasing-- go on, go.

385
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:26,232

00:16:28,186 --> 00:16:30,060
AUDIENCE: You got the
lion [INAUDIBLE] right.

387
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,490
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

388
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,906
Dave, can you get the peace?

389
00:16:33,906 --> 00:16:35,406
AUDIENCE: The others
are doing that.

390
00:16:35,406 --> 00:16:36,378
[INAUDIBLE]

391
00:16:36,378 --> 00:16:40,752
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

392
00:16:40,752 --> 00:16:42,656
AUDIENCE: Never seen that.

393
00:16:42,656 --> 00:16:43,780
AUDIENCE: I've never seen--

00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,930
AUDIENCE: The
calf's still alive.

00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:45,596
AUDIENCE: It is?

396
00:16:45,596 --> 00:16:46,290
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

397
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:48,441
It's trying to get away.

398
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:49,420
It's standing up.

399
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,362
AUDIENCE: It is.

400
00:16:50,362 --> 00:16:52,717
It's still alive.

401
00:16:52,717 --> 00:16:54,480
PROFESSOR: There's
much more to this.

402
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,270
There's many other videos
about lions and buffalo

403
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:02,670
finding a layer of baby
lions and the mother is gone.

404
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:05,280
And they just kill all the
lions in there for revenge,

405
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,839
or whatever it is, your
interpretation, I don't know.

406
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,720
But anyway, so I'm just
trying to tell you.

407
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,006
I'm not going to show you
more, but in the lectures,

408
00:17:12,006 --> 00:17:13,839
there's going to be a
number of videos here.

409
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,390
I'll show one more I think.

410
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,936
But I think this is--

411
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:20,190
I don't know, I think
you can see this is

412
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:22,060
better than an experiment, OK?

413
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:25,980
You really get--
to me, it really

414
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,490
showed me a kind of, a kind
of a social organization.

415
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:31,940
A kind of-- are these
animals conscious?

416
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,890
All of these kinds of
questions here that I think you

417
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,761
should think about.

418
00:17:36,761 --> 00:17:37,260
OK.

419
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,717
So on my website, on
the lecture there's

420
00:17:39,717 --> 00:17:41,800
going to be some other
videos that you can look at

421
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,860
and things like that.

422
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,100
I won't do this one, here.

423
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,550
This is a very
interesting video.

424
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,299
Some of you might
have seen it as well.

425
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:48,840
I don't exactly know
what the origin,

426
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,190
I won't show it here today.

427
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,480
But it's about a--

428
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,560
on the web, it says
monkey teases tiger,

429
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,450
it's a gibbon, or
something like that.

430
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,170
But it's a really amazing show.

431
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,750
It goes on for
about five minutes.

432
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,840
We're given just swinging
around and making

433
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,062
himself ready for attack.

434
00:18:05,062 --> 00:18:07,020
He runs along the ground,
the guys are chasing,

435
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,210
it's like playing tag.

436
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:10,500
And he runs up a tree
and he jumps over

437
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,580
them and he their tail
and he grabs their ears.

438
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,640
There are two lions,
two tigers there.

439
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,410
And he's just putting his life
at risk, but he's doing it.

440
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:20,910
Maybe that's that the theory
is, maybe that's his territory.

441
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,660
He doesn't want those
people around there.

442
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,760
But it's pretty amazing.

443
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,950
So just Google monkey
you know, teases tiger.

444
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,930
You'll see the full video.

445
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:33,340
It's a pretty damn
amazing video.

446
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,420
Another video that is fairly
interesting and this is just--

447
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,110
just shows you.

448
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,700
This is a guy named
Jaak Panksepp.

449
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,290
I used to be on a study
section with this guy.

450
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:41,790
I couldn't figure out what
this guy's talking about.

451
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,170
This was many years ago.

452
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:47,850
And he's now an expert
on laughter in rats.

453
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:53,360
And he tickles rats and
they follow him around.

454
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,270
And can you hear them laugh?

455
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,520
No, you can't hear them laugh.

456
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,540
So he got this bat detector
which takes ultrasonic sounds

457
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:04,242
and brings it down to
our frequency level.

458
00:19:04,242 --> 00:19:05,700
And you can hear
the rats laughing.

459
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,120
So try that out as well.

460
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,490
So you can do that
in your spare time.

461
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:10,720
So he's got some very--

462
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,220
Oh.

463
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,290
This one is kind of
interesting, War.

464
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,720
One of the interesting
things about--

465
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,310
We have sort of a whole field
called evolutionary psychology.

466
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:24,300
And what's the reasons why
animals might cooperate a lot?

467
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,430
That's what we're
talking about here.

468
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:30,390
These are really-- a lot of
these things are up in the air.

469
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:33,660
And there's a lot of
debates, but one possibility

470
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,400
is, if animals
cooperate, they can

471
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,100
deal with a rival group
of animals who might

472
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,840
be taking over their territory.

473
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,671
Animals have private property,
you might call it territory.

474
00:19:42,671 --> 00:19:44,670
They don't have contracts
or anything like that,

475
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:45,790
but it's pretty close.

476
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:48,710
And if they have territory
that they have and there's

477
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:51,780
another group that
has territory,

478
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,573
there's going to be conflicts.

479
00:19:53,573 --> 00:19:56,720
And why not call it war?

480
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,330
And humans have had war
for many generations.

481
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:03,630
And I just like to show
a little bit that--

482
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:06,330
these videos are
incredible videos.

483
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,760
The guy's name is
Timothy Clutton- Brock.

484
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,680
He's a ethologist at the
University of Cambridge.

485
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,750
He studied many different
kinds of animals.

486
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,630
And these meerkats--
there's been a,

487
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,622
there's actually been a TV show.

488
00:20:17,622 --> 00:20:19,080
Have you ever
watched the BBC show?

489
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,980
Anybody here?

490
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,250
It's a BBC show and it's
gone for four years.

491
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,310
I mean, how long
did Dynasty go for?

492
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,910
Or all these ones
that you guys watch?

493
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:30,010
I mean, four years of this
life of these animals here.

494
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:32,010
And the really interesting
thing about-- they're

495
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:36,090
about one foot tall
and they run in troops.

496
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:39,120
This group of animals
is really interesting.

497
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,310
There's more animals
than you think.

498
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:44,250
These are female-
dominated societies.

499
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,170
There's a alpha female.

500
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:49,530
And she has, she
has many children.

501
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,240
And then her
daughters are supposed

502
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,000
to take care of her
kids, not their kids.

503
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,610
What happens is sometimes
the daughter wanders off

504
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:58,380
and some Romeo was
coming around and they

505
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,850
had babies and stuff like that.

506
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:04,050
That daughter has to really
be nice to the mom to stay.

507
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:06,210
Usually she's
banished and she dies,

508
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:08,700
or she joins that other troop.

509
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,310
There's so many
different things.

510
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,690
And these animals-- you
can see these guys, here.

511
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:15,900
See the investigators
on the BBC show--

512
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,750
these animals somehow have
been totally inured to humans.

513
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,510
So they're doing all their thing
and people are just walking

514
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:23,435
around with their cameras.

515
00:21:23,435 --> 00:21:25,560
So this is-- you don't have
to set up a laboratory,

516
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,730
you just go out there.

517
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:29,550
And you have to go to
the Kalahari Desert.

518
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:32,790
But I think that this is
an incredible research

519
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:35,250
enterprise that's been
going on for about 10 years.

520
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,950
One of the things is they--

521
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:42,720
I think, in many ways, it's
one of the most studied

522
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,470
social animals because the
Kalahari Desert is just open.

523
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,940
You can see everything.

524
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:52,410
One of the things they do is
they dig down into burrows.

525
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:55,992
And so when they're digging way
down-- they can eat scorpions.

526
00:21:55,992 --> 00:21:57,700
They're not, they're
not bothered if they

527
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,340
get stung by a scorpion.

528
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,634
But if they're down there
and there's hawks going over,

529
00:22:01,634 --> 00:22:02,800
they can just pick them off.

530
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,910
So they have these sentries
and things like that.

531
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:08,340
So they sort of double up--
and then they have babysitting

532
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,140
co-ops where they're
teenagers that--

533
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,640
they have these
burrows underground.

534
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,880
But of course you can't-- if
you're growing up as a meerkat.

535
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,340
By the way, meerkats have
nothing to do with cats,

536
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:20,890
but they're somehow
related to mongoose.

537
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:22,860
They're sort of a little
more in that category.

538
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,309
But anyway, they have a
baby sitting kind of thing

539
00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:26,850
where they let the
kids out on there.

540
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:29,391
They play a little bit and if
it gets strange, they run back.

541
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:32,160
And so there's a whole
babysitting thing

542
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,740
because every day they have
to go out and forage for food.

543
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,630
And they go very long distances.

544
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:39,390
The territory of these
meerkats could be

545
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:41,370
as much as a square millimeter.

546
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:42,030
That's amazing.

547
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,613
Just think of these
animals, this big,

548
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:46,170
going over a square
millimeter, a kilometer.

549
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:48,070
That's territory.

550
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,734
So what we have, of course,
in the human situation--

551
00:22:50,734 --> 00:22:52,234
DOCUMENTARY NARRATOR:
Moments later,

552
00:22:52,234 --> 00:22:56,532
the rest of the whiskers
return from foraging.

553
00:22:56,532 --> 00:22:58,030
From the brow of
the hill, they see

554
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:01,372
that their home has been
overrun by the [INAUDIBLE]..

555
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:14,060
The rival group spot
the owners of the burrow

556
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:20,232
and the angry whiskers waste no
time in commencing the attack.

557
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,128
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

558
00:23:22,128 --> 00:23:24,450
DOCUMENTARY NARRATOR:
--Straight towards the whiskers.

559
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:26,700
They're going to defend
this piece of territory

560
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,305
as if it's their own.

561
00:23:28,305 --> 00:23:31,210
A bloody fight is inevitable.

562
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:35,114
One of these sworn enemies
will have to be in [INAUDIBLE]..

563
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,015
The [INAUDIBLE] a hasty retreat.

564
00:24:02,015 --> 00:24:04,010
PROFESSOR: The good guys won.

565
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:06,545
What I'm going to tell
you is a pale sort

566
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:09,020
of version of all
that stuff but I

567
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,370
think we have to study
stuff in the laboratory.

568
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:14,030
So a lot of my interest
comes from the work

569
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:16,880
of Nalini Ambady who
is a colleague of mine,

570
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,340
long ago in
psychology department.

571
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,230
And so what--
we're going to go--

572
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:23,687
I'm going to talk about
humans now because that's

573
00:24:23,687 --> 00:24:24,770
what I've been able to do.

574
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:27,320
I'm not-- But I do
think that we really

575
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,182
need to look at all different
parts of the animal kingdom.

576
00:24:30,182 --> 00:24:31,640
But she did something
that's really

577
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,249
quite interesting as
a social psychologist.

578
00:24:34,249 --> 00:24:36,790
Mostly people have been handing
out questionnaires and people

579
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:38,331
how-- what do you
think about things?

580
00:24:38,331 --> 00:24:42,290
Social psychology has
mostly been about attitudes

581
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:45,350
and had a rightful good
history about prejudice.

582
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,060
And how people who have--

583
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,476
a lot of the social
psychology came out of the--

584
00:24:49,476 --> 00:24:52,960
was stimulated by what happened
in the Second World War,

585
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,249
the atrocities and
things like that.

586
00:24:55,249 --> 00:24:56,790
How could people do
things like that?

587
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,498
And so those are really
important things.

588
00:24:58,498 --> 00:24:59,570
And you read about them.

589
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:00,986
But she did something
sort of more

590
00:25:00,986 --> 00:25:03,890
at an everyday level in
a sense, and just take

591
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:07,880
pictures, very few pictures
of different people.

592
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,970
And just see what people
get from these pictures.

593
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:11,510
So clip, movie clips.

594
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,490
And basically, she
did one thing and just

595
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:17,690
had people rate
teachers that they--

596
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:18,530
this is at Harvard.

597
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:20,870
We had teaching fellows
and they were just

598
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:23,020
talking to their class
and things like that.

599
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,492
And then students just rated
them, what they thought,

600
00:25:25,492 --> 00:25:27,950
how good a teacher they were,
just on different adjectives.

601
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:31,250
And that really predicted
the student ratings

602
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,465
of the whole course.

603
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:35,977
In other words, 10 seconds was
able to predict the ratings

604
00:25:35,977 --> 00:25:36,810
of the whole course.

605
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:41,054
So remember that
when you do teaching.

606
00:25:41,054 --> 00:25:42,220
I'm hopeless, but who knows.

607
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:47,060
Anyway-- Basically, here's
another thing they did.

608
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:47,560
OK.

609
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,160
There's that.

610
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,732
Gaydar, you can tell if
somebody is gay or straight

611
00:25:51,732 --> 00:25:52,690
or something like that.

612
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:55,760
It only presenting the thing
for about 15 millisecond.

613
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,310
I find that hard to believe.

614
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:00,850
If you look at a video, two
people talking together,

615
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:03,470
you can tell whether they're
friends or strangers.

616
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,630
There was a really
interesting one.

617
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:12,750
This is really-- outcome is
you have an interview or tapes

618
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,700
between doctors and patients.

619
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,400
And you can outcome variables
like whether that doctor got

620
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,100
sued or not.

621
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,970
You can have people
rate, have adjectives

622
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,190
and it's sort of
like, a little bit

623
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:22,830
like-- you can think of
doing machine learning,

624
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,538
just taking all those
adjectives and then

625
00:26:24,538 --> 00:26:27,410
sort of predict whether that
person is going to be sued.

626
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:31,170
You can see just by this a
kind of a crowd-sourcing way

627
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:34,470
of dealing with all
kinds of real world,

628
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:39,140
social, significant things.

629
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,290
OK.

630
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:42,160
So I've worked a lot
on face recognition.

631
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,910
That's a very important
thing in the sense

632
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:47,040
that in order to negotiate
our social world, if you

633
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,030
can't do facial recognition,
you're in trouble.

634
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:52,980
I work a lot of people
with prosopagnosic.

635
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,970
Oliver Sacks.

636
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:55,260
May know who Oliver Sacks is.

637
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,570
He's definitely prosopagnosic.

638
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:00,230
And if he's at a party,
he's a little bit lost.

639
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:04,219
But he's a-- he has so many
other charming characteristics

640
00:27:04,219 --> 00:27:05,010
that he can manage.

641
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:06,301
People come up and talk to him.

642
00:27:06,301 --> 00:27:07,770
But you can imagine,
if you're not

643
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:10,404
that charming,
witty, funny person

644
00:27:10,404 --> 00:27:11,820
and you don't
recognize people who

645
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,940
you're supposed to
recognize, you're in trouble.

646
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:17,650
One of the subject
I worked with, she's

647
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:20,610
a quite a well-known author.

648
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,830
And she goes on book
tours, she's happy,

649
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:25,410
and she is she does
very, very well.

650
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,300
She has a problem
with face recognition,

651
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,370
but she can't really
recognize a lot

652
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:30,660
of the guys in her departure.

653
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,670
She teaches-- She's an
English literature professor.

654
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,440
There's about four
guys in our department.

655
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,570
She can't really recognize
one from another.

656
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:38,860
That makes social
interactions very difficult.

657
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:42,900
So we all are experts
at face recognition

658
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,895
but I've studied something
called face blindness.

659
00:27:45,895 --> 00:27:48,270
But I just want to step back
because the thought occurred

660
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:48,960
to me.

661
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,580
This is one thing
that's really--

662
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:53,780
we've just published, not
myself, but my collaborators,

663
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,562
we've--

664
00:27:54,562 --> 00:27:56,020
well, I'll come
back to that later.

665
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:59,090
It's called face recognition
under early stress.

666
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:00,300
I'll come back to that later.

667
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,241
Remind me.

668
00:28:01,241 --> 00:28:01,740
OK.

669
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,530
So over the last 100
years or so, there's

670
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:07,440
something called acquired
prosopagnosia which

671
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,160
means that, I think, the
best case was, I think,

672
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,770
World War II victims,
the German soldiers

673
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,060
in the Second World War.

674
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:19,830
And those people, you could
tell they had face recognition

675
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:24,120
problems because of course, they
were able to recognize faces,

676
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,190
and later, they
weren't able to do it.

677
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:28,620
And so-- but more
recently, and I've

678
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,200
studied hundreds
of these people,

679
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,900
and we've actually signed
up thousands of them.

680
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,300
People-- we just we
put a website out

681
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,360
and we basically have studied
huge numbers of people

682
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,720
who are just naturally occurring
people who can't recognize

683
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,380
faces very well at all.

684
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,980
And we've got about
6,000 registrants.

685
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,247
We really don't test
them that much now,

686
00:28:49,247 --> 00:28:50,580
but we can test them on the web.

687
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:53,770
As Nancy mentioned, we
do that kind of thing.

688
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:56,490
Just some testimonials from
these people, one or two,

689
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:58,830
just shows the
problem they have.

690
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:01,540
This week, I went to the
wrong baby at my son's daycare

691
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:04,260
and only realized he was not
my son, blah, blah, blah.

692
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:07,980
So in an audience
like this, you don't

693
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,470
have to identify yourself since
you got so many people who

694
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:11,390
are STEM people.

695
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:13,680
STEM people sometimes
have these problems.

696
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,020
Usually if I give a lecture
to an audience like that,

697
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,240
somebody will come
up and say that's me.

698
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,560
So this is a lady
I know quite well.

699
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,390
She's got a PhD in
differential geometry.

700
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,620
She's a mathematician.

701
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,080
She has lots of problems.

702
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,910
She is one of the
few [INAUDIBLE]

703
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:33,360
that I think is kind of
mildly on the spectrum.

704
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,850
But most of the people I've
studied are not autistic

705
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:39,270
or Asperger's in any way.

706
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:41,190
But a lot of people
have problem.

707
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:42,635
I claim it's a visual problem.

708
00:29:42,635 --> 00:29:44,760
It's not a psychiatric
problem or a social problem,

709
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,930
but it does lead
to social problems.

710
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:50,270
And with Brad
Duchaine, I've studied

711
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,050
these people quite extensively.

712
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:52,989
And the thing that--

713
00:29:52,989 --> 00:29:54,780
I just want to say, in
order to study them,

714
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:57,450
we developed a face
recognition test.

715
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:00,030
I got into the testing
business in this way

716
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:02,640
because the tests that were
out there weren't very good.

717
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,889
They were really bad.

718
00:30:03,889 --> 00:30:04,680
I mean, they were--

719
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,120
I won't go into
how bad they were.

720
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,460
So we spent three or
four years just making up

721
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:12,420
a test, which is now used
widely around the world.

722
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:15,300
And I don't want to go into
the details of the test

723
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,235
but it basically
enables people to sort

724
00:30:17,235 --> 00:30:18,780
of over-learn about six faces.

725
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,890
It's a little bit like
natural face recognition.

726
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:23,130
It's not-- I think
it's a very good test.

727
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:25,380
I won't go into why
and things like that.

728
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,300
And it gets harder and harder.

729
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,500
But I just want
to say that we've

730
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,240
been able to characterize
these prosopagnosia people.

731
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,257
But somebody all of a
sudden shows up and says,

732
00:30:34,257 --> 00:30:35,340
well, I'm not one of them.

733
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,420
I'm super.

734
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,160
So we've study those
people as well.

735
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,150
I won't go into detail.

736
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:43,090
We made a lot of
studies about them.

737
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:45,300
Just a couple of testimonials.

738
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,680
I pretend I don't
remember people

739
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,304
because people think
I'm stalking them,

740
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:49,360
or something like that.

741
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,530
So now we've studied
half a dozen of them.

742
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:56,910
And now we're studying a much
larger population of them.

743
00:30:56,910 --> 00:31:00,270
I would-- All I'd like to
say is these people are as

744
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,937
good as prosopagnosics are bad.

745
00:31:01,937 --> 00:31:04,270
They're really-- but we haven't
found that many of them.

746
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,640
We've probably identified
about 30 of them

747
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,910
and we've been looking.

748
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:10,720
And we give them much harder
tests of face recognition.

749
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,520
Some of you, if you
can recognize all four

750
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,700
of these people before they
were famous, I'll come up

751
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,647
and you might be one of
our people, but I doubt it.

752
00:31:18,647 --> 00:31:20,980
Most people think they're
very good at face recognition.

753
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,360
When we test them,
they're not that good.

754
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,950
So nature versus nurture.

755
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,810
Make sure I don't go
over my time, here.

756
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:34,130
You know, most of
you are not psychol--

757
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:37,070
how many people are
psychologists here?

758
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:37,630
OK.

759
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:41,580
So you know that
there's some experiments

760
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:44,910
called twin studies
where you study

761
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:49,020
some characteristics
in monozygotic twins

762
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,520
and then different,
dizygotic, dizygotic twins.

763
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,734
And so the idea here is
that they sort of share

764
00:31:53,734 --> 00:31:54,900
the same family environment.

765
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,330
Of course, each
person's different,

766
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:57,585
and they have a different way
of dealing with the family

767
00:31:57,585 --> 00:31:58,418
and stuff like that.

768
00:31:58,418 --> 00:32:00,220
But that's the best we can do.

769
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:05,310
But if you can show that the
correlation between twin 1

770
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:08,177
and twin 2 is very, very
high, and in our case,

771
00:32:08,177 --> 00:32:09,510
it's going to be extremely high.

772
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:13,200
In fact, it's just as high if
twin 1 took the test twice.

773
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,240
That indicates-- and
then if you compare it

774
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:19,020
with dizygotic twins, there's
a real difference there.

775
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:22,110
And that's what we've shown
essentially, is that--

776
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:24,460
I'm just saying, the test
reliability is very good.

777
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:32,940
It's tech has a R of
0.7, which is very good.

778
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,320
And we had--

779
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,680
There's 350 just random people
who took the test twice.

780
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:41,010
But now what you can do,
we have this online way

781
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:43,932
of doing research where we can
just have people come up and--

782
00:32:43,932 --> 00:32:45,390
the real hard thing
in twin studies

783
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:48,695
is not to get monozygotic twins,
it's to get dizygotic twins.

784
00:32:48,695 --> 00:32:50,820
Dizygotic twins don't really
care about being twins

785
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:53,860
that much, but monozygotic
feel, hey, I'm a twin.

786
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:58,140
My wife is a monozygotic twin
so I know all about this.

787
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:01,440
So we have something called
the Austrian twin registry.

788
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,230
And we pay them and
they-- a very nominal fee

789
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:05,766
and they do our tests online.

790
00:33:05,766 --> 00:33:07,140
And what's really
interesting, we

791
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,870
found if you correlate
twin 1 and twin 2,

792
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:12,040
they have to be obviously
the same gender.

793
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,390
The correlation, you'll
see here, is 0.7.

794
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:18,120
It's just as good if the
twin took the test twice.

795
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,650
That's pretty darn amazing.

796
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:21,630
And the dizygotic is 0.3.

797
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:24,170
So in this particular
situation, I

798
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:26,280
think we've shown
to our astonishment

799
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,730
that the ability of this
face-- the ability to learn

800
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:34,630
new faces is almost entirely
heritable, whatever that means.

801
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:36,900
I mean, it's a
technical definition,

802
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:42,300
but it indicates that your
ability to recognize faces

803
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:47,240
is strongly controlled by
other factors than experience.

804
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,830
And that's when I want to bring
up this childhood adversity

805
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:50,820
thing, here.

806
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:55,800
Laura Germine has done a
very large survey of I think,

807
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:00,480
over 1,000 people who were--

808
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,240
and these are things-- we had
trouble with the IRB here,

809
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,450
but people talked about all
of their horrible things that

810
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:10,199
happened to them,
childhood sexual abuse,

811
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:12,570
neglect by their
parents, all kinds

812
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:15,719
of things that are really
bad when you're growing up.

813
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,760
And then we did a lot
of tests on the web.

814
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,250
And everything, all our
tests showed real deficits

815
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:27,150
in cognitive abilities, in
even emotion recognition,

816
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:30,630
but there was no deficit
in ability to learn faces.

817
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,880
So that's pretty--
so what I would

818
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:36,480
like to suggest is that somehow
we're sort of topped out.

819
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,790
We have enough
experience seeing faces

820
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:40,929
and we've reached our asymptote.

821
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:43,199
That's just a point that
might be of interest here.

822
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:49,199
So another thing
we've done recently,

823
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,900
I don't have any data here, but
we just got it paper accepted,

824
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:55,469
was to show that using
the same sort of paradigm

825
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:57,780
of monozygotic and
dizygotic twins

826
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:02,460
that face
attractiveness is not--

827
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:05,560
there's no genetic component
at all, basically zero.

828
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:09,450
So here's a face attractiveness
test that we've cooked up here.

829
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:10,502
Here's a bunch of faces.

830
00:35:10,502 --> 00:35:12,210
You have a bunch of
cards, you sort them.

831
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,680
That's all you do.

832
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,260
You get the mean ratings
for all the faces

833
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,820
and then you rate the faces.

834
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,760
And I'm going to
say, OK, you're--

835
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,490
let's say that upper
left- hand corner,

836
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:27,190
that's one person's ratings
versus the mean ratings.

837
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:29,190
That's a correlation of 0.74.

838
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,970
The next person's 0.91.

839
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:34,920
That's really unimaginable
to me that, that person

840
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,287
there's correlation with
the mean rating is so high.

841
00:35:37,287 --> 00:35:38,370
And look at these ratings.

842
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:39,600
They're very, very high.

843
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,912
Of course, these are
Harvard undergraduates.

844
00:35:41,912 --> 00:35:43,620
They all have the same
kind of mentality.

845
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,480
Perhaps that's maybe
that's the point.

846
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,760
But the correlation
with the mean, this

847
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,860
is just from one of my courses.

848
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,670
It's unbelievable.

849
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:53,190
The correlation, the
agreement of who's attractive

850
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,780
and who's not attractive
is astonishing.

851
00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:01,260
So what we did was we had
these MZ versus DZ twins

852
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,640
and had them rate them.

853
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,320
We have a kind of a jingle.

854
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,850
We say, how quirky are you
when you're a beauty judge,

855
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:11,520
or something like that
because our web site,

856
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,230
we don't pay anybody.

857
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:16,170
In the twin study, we do, but
we like to make the tests fun

858
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:17,610
and interesting to the people.

859
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:19,290
And we, most of
the time, give them

860
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:20,850
feedback as to how they done.

861
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:22,470
So all I'm trying
to tell you there

862
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:26,460
is that we don't see any genetic
component there at all when

863
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,870
you do the monozygotic
and dizygotic twins, here.

864
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:31,270
Gender versus attractiveness.

865
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:34,510
Where you give a bunch of
pictures to people and you say,

866
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:37,420
which looks more
feminine, more masculine?

867
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:40,240
You do that with girls and
then you do it with boys.

868
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,430
Which was more
masculine, feminine?

869
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:45,850
Those are very
reliable ratings also.

870
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:49,480
It's hard to see but female
attractiveness correlates very

871
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,930
well with the gender judgment,
male attractiveness doesn't.

872
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:55,180
Actually male attractiveness
is quite robust.

873
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,610
People can agree on
male attractiveness,

874
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:59,540
but it's not the gender axis.

875
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:02,820
Maybe you know, 2000 years ago
it was machoness or something

876
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:03,320
like that.

877
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:07,430
But in our society, it's agreed
upon but it's a little bit

878
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:07,930
mysterious.

879
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:10,000
Alex Todorov has
published a paper

880
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,560
on this, which I
don't understand.

881
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,680
But he says he explains
it, but I'm not sure.

882
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,440
But that's an interesting
area of what constitutes

883
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,510
male attractiveness.

884
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:23,350
A fellow, who is an MIT
student, Richard Russell,

885
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:26,470
found one of the
things that is related

886
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:28,000
to female attractiveness.

887
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,340
It's basically contrast,
facial contrast.

888
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:33,340
Not how dark you are,
but your facial contrast.

889
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,200
And he just found
that if you just

890
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,120
measured the
contrast of pictures,

891
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,760
you find the female
average contrast is

892
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,280
higher than the male contrast.

893
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,840
And if you take a
picture like that,

894
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:47,790
which is an androgynous person
here, and you just change--

895
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:51,280
you have the same picture and
you just increase the contrast,

896
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,640
the one on the left
looks more female.

897
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,070
And maybe that's the reason
that Richard thinks that this

898
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,720
is the basis of some cosmetics.

899
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,860
And he works with
a cosmetic company.

900
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,311
He's not doing--

901
00:38:04,311 --> 00:38:04,810
OK.

902
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:07,330
So the final part of this
talk, I'd like to talk about

903
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:10,590
is that, which I'm more
involved in right now.

904
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:13,570
Is I sort of feel that
most of social psychology

905
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:16,000
is involved in kind
of asking people

906
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,619
questions and things like
that about sociology.

907
00:38:18,619 --> 00:38:20,410
But as I said in the
beginning of the talk,

908
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:22,057
I feel that the
realm of human action

909
00:38:22,057 --> 00:38:23,890
is something that has
not been investigated.

910
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:26,840
So I just feel it's something
that we need to probe.

911
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,540
And what I would
like to argue is

912
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:31,150
that by studying
our human actions,

913
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:33,370
we can actually reveal
our social perceptions.

914
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:35,060
That's kind of the point here.

915
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:39,456
So most of you have been
in very crowded places

916
00:38:39,456 --> 00:38:41,580
and you don't bump into
people and stuff like that.

917
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,070
And there's many
reasons for that.

918
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:45,580
But basically it's
pretty amazing

919
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:48,290
that people, pretty much,
don't run into each other

920
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:51,760
in very crowded and when
they're very rushed.

921
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,450
And there are many situations in
which your social interactions

922
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:58,900
with people are extremely
skilled in a sense,

923
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:01,300
in different kinds
of dancing or fencing

924
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,340
or different kinds of athletics.

925
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:06,510
So I claim this is
the domain of what

926
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:11,030
I call rapid social perception.

927
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:14,050
So how can we study
rapid social perception?

928
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:17,732
Well, I'm OK with
all these things,

929
00:39:17,732 --> 00:39:19,190
showing movies and
stuff like that.

930
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,064
But we've sort of put
it into the laboratory,

931
00:39:21,064 --> 00:39:24,800
in a more discrete fashion just
because we can study it easily.

932
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,502
Now one of them is
that most of you

933
00:39:26,502 --> 00:39:28,210
watch the World Cup,
is the penalty kick.

934
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:30,250
It doesn't happen all the time,
but every once in a while,

935
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:30,760
it happens.

936
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,370
And you know, that's a
really dramatic moment.

937
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:34,890
And of course, you
have to predict

938
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:38,170
which way the kicker
is going to go ahead

939
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:40,760
of time if you're the goalie.

940
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,800
So we've set up something which
was sort of parallel to it

941
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,600
which I call the
lab version, here.

942
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,890
So here's the kicker, here.

943
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:54,430
But the job is not to kick
the ball into the area,

944
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:57,060
but just touch
target left or right.

945
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:57,880
That's your job.

946
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,730
That's all you do.

947
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,020
Go boom, boom.

948
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,040
That's it.

949
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,830
That's the trial.

950
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:03,850
So it's very simple.

951
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:05,560
And we tell people it's a game.

952
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,740
If you are up to the game--

953
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:11,660
The blocker-- if you get
there within 150 mil--

954
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:14,830
we sort of titrate it to match
the skill of the two people.

955
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:15,550
But it's a game.

956
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:17,536
Harvard undergraduates
love the game.

957
00:40:17,536 --> 00:40:18,910
They get tired
because a little--

958
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:20,560
but there's no problem.

959
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,920
Harvard undergraduates don't
know each other usually

960
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,820
so they're not friends
or anything like that.

961
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,750
They just, they
just come in there.

962
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:29,240
So I think there's a
movie here as well.

963
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:33,380
Let's see if I can
get this going here.

964
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:35,760
Oh, here, go this way.

965
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,380
OK.

966
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,760
So this is the game, here.

967
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:44,719
Is it moving?

968
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:45,260
There you go.

969
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:47,390
Here.

970
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:48,050
That's it.

971
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:50,260
That's the game.

972
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:52,670
I like pretty
simple experiments.

973
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:53,250
OK.

974
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:56,180
So but then what we do is
we just measure the finger

975
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:59,940
position of the two players.

976
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,190
You can just buy these things.

977
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,290
They are off the shelf.

978
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:03,740
They're not very expensive.

979
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:06,530
The one I had like you know,
a couple of thousand dollars

980
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:07,370
these days.

981
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:09,020
This is very low tech.

982
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:11,000
It measures the
position of the fingers

983
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,810
and at a high precision, very
fast, and stuff like that.

984
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:16,080
You can buy this thing.

985
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,480
It takes a while to get it
going and stuff like that.

986
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:25,580
So basically, we can
map the trajectories

987
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:26,970
of the various people.

988
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:29,135
And you can see that
they're well- behaved.

989
00:41:29,135 --> 00:41:31,040
And just like that.

990
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,930
So what's interesting
is the timing here.

991
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:37,170
So the kicker goes like
this and the blocker--

992
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:39,180
so you can make little
measurements, here.

993
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:41,900
And so we can just measure the
horizontal positions, here.

994
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:45,509
So the blue is the kicker
and the red is the blocker.

995
00:41:45,509 --> 00:41:47,550
And so obviously, they
can't do at the same time.

996
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:50,340
But the reaction
times are interesting.

997
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:54,600
What's that difference in
the launch point, there.

998
00:41:54,600 --> 00:42:02,120
And what we found was it
was actually very low.

999
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,710
You can see it there.

1000
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:08,720
Some were as low as 100
milliseconds but it's 150--

1001
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,610
it's lower than choice
reaction times normally.

1002
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:13,880
So if you take-- if you
could have a button box

1003
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,160
and put a buzzer or
something like that,

1004
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,620
choice reaction
times are usually

1005
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,390
about 100 milliseconds longer.

1006
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:23,070
So what's going on here?

1007
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:27,940
But maybe choice reaction time
isn't a really good choice.

1008
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:29,420
So what we did was we took--

1009
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:32,180
we actually can take the
position of the finger

1010
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:33,930
and map it on the screen.

1011
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:37,250
And we have a little experiment
here, where you actually--

1012
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:39,090
instead of playing
against a person,

1013
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:41,430
you just, there's a little
dot that zooms up there

1014
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:42,540
and you do that.

1015
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:45,860
So maybe it's that--
the fact of that.

1016
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:49,070
So we do this, and
that's the experiment.

1017
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:50,880
And it turns out
this experiment,

1018
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,380
we're about 100
milliseconds longer.

1019
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,630
So in other words, if you're
playing against the human

1020
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:57,840
being, that's on average
about 100 milliseconds.

1021
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,770
So you are faster when you're
dealing with human being.

1022
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:07,490
I will just skip over
some of this stuff, here.

1023
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:11,210
And again, there's
no learning here.

1024
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:14,270
Basically, it's just, it's flat.

1025
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:16,340
So what's going on here?

1026
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:19,370
We think what's happening here,
and this is the punch line,

1027
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:21,050
I'll just elaborate
a little bit more.

1028
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:22,790
You think all through
your life you've

1029
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:25,070
seen people do different
kinds of actions.

1030
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:27,740
And if you do any
kind of action,

1031
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:30,050
there's all kinds of
postural adjustments.

1032
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:32,900
I was just talking to one of
the guys in Emilio Bizzi's lab.

1033
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:35,000
If you're sort of in
different kinds of sports,

1034
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,580
if you lunge like that,
what's the first muscles

1035
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:39,900
that contract?

1036
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:42,600
Anybody want to know?

1037
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,610
Your butt.

1038
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:50,610
Because that's to maintain
your center of gravity.

1039
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:51,800
So there's all kinds of--

1040
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:55,297
I'm not saying people will
watch you know, their butts

1041
00:43:55,297 --> 00:43:56,130
and stuff like that.

1042
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:58,610
But when you make
any kind of motion,

1043
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:00,580
it's your whole
body is connected.

1044
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:04,760
And somehow we have
knowledge, implicitly of this.

1045
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,530
So what's going on here?

1046
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:10,130
We talk about 90
milliseconds or so.

1047
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:12,260
What section of the
body informative?

1048
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:14,510
Well, in a sense this is
kind of-- you just block off

1049
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:16,051
different pieces
and stuff like that.

1050
00:44:16,051 --> 00:44:18,080
And we just, we have
all different kinds

1051
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,550
of ways we can just--

1052
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:20,220
limited.

1053
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:22,770
And we do-- we did all kinds
of experiments like that.

1054
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:27,110
And basically, if
you show all, there's

1055
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:29,330
an advantage, just the
torso or just the head

1056
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:32,035
and there's the computer,
it's all over the place.

1057
00:44:32,035 --> 00:44:33,410
That the information
is all over.

1058
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:35,694
But that's not
unreasonable because when

1059
00:44:35,694 --> 00:44:37,610
you're doing something,
all parts of your body

1060
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:38,510
are connected.

1061
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:41,780
So there's quite an advantage.

1062
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:44,801
I think basically, oh,
this is your question.

1063
00:44:44,801 --> 00:44:45,800
We're moving this stuff.

1064
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,480
So we have-- we call
them cut videos here.

1065
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,380
So what we do is we
play a video, here.

1066
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:54,950
By the way, we now
have shown that people

1067
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:56,720
would behave exactly
the same to a video

1068
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,380
than they do to
the other person.

1069
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:00,050
So that makes the
life a little simpler.

1070
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:03,240
So there we go.

1071
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:06,830
There's-- I don't know if you
can tell, but essentially,

1072
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:09,770
nobody, except a couple
of star athletes,

1073
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:11,880
could tell what it was.

1074
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:15,060
And it turns out, in the
cut videos, in other words,

1075
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:16,780
you don't have that
preparatory stuff.

1076
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:19,370
You just have all that
if the person is still,

1077
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:21,380
we don't even know
what those motions are.

1078
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:24,660
But basically, they're
100 milliseconds slower

1079
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:26,720
than the cut videos.

1080
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,445
So another thing
is, oh, we even did

1081
00:45:28,445 --> 00:45:30,320
stuff-- we did another
series of experiments.

1082
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,794
Well, maybe it's eye movements.

1083
00:45:31,794 --> 00:45:33,710
And basically, we just
did some more blocking.

1084
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:37,140
And shoulders are important,
you can see, here.

1085
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:38,270
Oh, I didn't show that.

1086
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:39,436
I don't have the data there.

1087
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:43,770
But basically every-- even
the head, there's a little--

1088
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:46,270
all of those, the first
five, except the last one,

1089
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:47,460
were very good.

1090
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,914
Even the last one, you
can hardly see anything.

1091
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:51,330
You just see the
head then you see

1092
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:54,734
the eye movement is a little
bit of an advantage, even there.

1093
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:03,780
OK.

1094
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:08,070
So basically, what I'm
trying to say more broadly,

1095
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:12,330
is that our ability to
understand humans probably more

1096
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:14,400
to predict what
they're going to do

1097
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,090
is something that we've
learned somewhat unconsciously.

1098
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:20,340
We're going to do a lot of
machine learning of what

1099
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:21,510
parts of the body it is.

1100
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:22,885
And all kinds of
stuff like that.

1101
00:46:22,885 --> 00:46:24,450
I'm interested in
if you people have

1102
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:26,241
some ideas of what
other kinds of things we

1103
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:28,710
can do to generalize this.

1104
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:31,140
But I think it's
an area where we--

1105
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:33,450
it helps us understand
all the kind of knowledge

1106
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:35,880
that we do have of
other people that we

1107
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:42,740
can weed out in ways that are
very subtle, but reliable.
