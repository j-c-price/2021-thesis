8
00:00:21,327 --> 00:00:21,910
PROFESSOR: OK.

9
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:22,785
So let's get started.

10
00:00:22,785 --> 00:00:24,340
So before I get into
any poker I want

11
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,890
to talk about the
mentality I want everyone

12
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,830
to try to have when analyzing
poker in this class.

13
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,900
So I call it the
decision mentality.

14
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,070
I'm going to start with a story.

15
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,800
Who here has heard of
credit card roulette?

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,190
It's like a game you play
at the end of a guy going

17
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:40,090
to restaurants.

18
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:41,910
So what happens
is poker players,

19
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,242
they're going to split
the bill by instead

20
00:00:44,242 --> 00:00:46,450
of everyone paying their
own bill, which is annoying.

21
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,231
You have to keep track.

22
00:00:48,231 --> 00:00:50,480
You might have to Venmo
people after the exact amount.

23
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,810
And sometimes the
waiter or waitress

24
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:55,040
doesn't want to split
the bill per person.

25
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,180
So poker players get around
this by just picking one person

26
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,800
at random to pay the bill.

27
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,240
And we like making
this exciting.

28
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,930
So what we do is we ask everyone
to put in their credit cards.

29
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:08,060
And then we pull out the
credit cards one at a time.

30
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,450
And if your credit card is
pulled out then you're safe.

31
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:14,630
And the last person in has
to pay for the whole table.

32
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,619
So it's a pretty fun game.

33
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:18,910
Yeah, I think I'm pretty lucky.

34
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,970
The biggest one I
lost was in Hong Kong.

35
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,980
I once had to pay
around 1,200 USD.

36
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,720
It was a pretty big table.

37
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,820
But overall I'm pretty
good at this game.

38
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,180
It's a game of skill for sure.

39
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,320
But sometimes this results
in some funny stories

40
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,820
with non poker players.

41
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,860
So this is something that
happened to some poker players.

42
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,600
So poker pro Matt, he goes to
dinner with poker pro Steven.

43
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,350
And that brings Emily, who's
a close friend whom he also

44
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,980
has a romantic interest in.

45
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,990
So when the bill
comes Matt's like OK,

46
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,460
I'm going to pay for it Emily.

47
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,960
So he puts in two credit cards.

48
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,110
He's like the second credit card
is for Steven-- is for Emily.

49
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,640
And then Steven
pays for himself.

50
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,920
So Stephen puts in
one credit card.

51
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,900
So they play credit
card roulette.

52
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,330
And then Matt, being
a very lucky guy,

53
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,700
pulls out both of his credit
cards before Steven's.

54
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,690
And Steven ends up paying
for all three of them.

55
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:13,640
So now the question is,
who should Emily thank.

56
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,900
So who would you thank if
you were in Emily's shoes?

57
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:23,112
Does anyone want to
say to thank Steven?

58
00:02:23,112 --> 00:02:23,792
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

59
00:02:23,792 --> 00:02:26,000
PROFESSOR: Because Steven
actually paid for the meal.

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,690
So I think it's a
totally reasonable thing

61
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,440
to do as a reasonable person
to thank Steven who actually

62
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,016
had to pull out his wallet.

63
00:02:34,016 --> 00:02:35,390
So in this class
we want everyone

64
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,840
to think in terms of the
expected results and not

65
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,980
actual results.

66
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,190
So Emily should be thanking
Matt because, on average, Matt

67
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,540
put in the card for Emily.

68
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,050
And on average Matt is
going to be paying for Emily

69
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,450
because Matt's
going to be paying

70
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,370
the one third of the time
that Emily would be paying.

71
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,370
But at the time, Emily
thanked Steven for her meal

72
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,670
and then didn't say
anything to Matt.

73
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,180
And then Matt was upset about
it and told the entire poker

74
00:02:59,180 --> 00:02:59,680
community.

75
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,346
That's how I found
out about this story.

76
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,730
So we want to think about
in terms of on average

77
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,570
what your decision
would have whether you

78
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:12,430
would have made money in
expectation or on average.

79
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,350
So roughly, the law
of large numbers

80
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,680
says, over your
lifetime, the amount

81
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,970
you end up paying for
credit card roulette is

82
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,310
the same as you would have
paid from splitting the bill.

83
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,602
So you know why split the bill?

84
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:24,309
You might as well just
save a lot of time

85
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:26,280
by playing this fun
game every single time.

86
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,900
And over your
lifetime, the amount

87
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,280
you pay in credit card
roulette is roughly

88
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,750
going to be what you would
have paid from splitting.

89
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,120
So all randomness
eventually averages out

90
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,560
to it's expected value.

91
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,750
That's what this is saying.

92
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,520
So what does eventually mean?

93
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,434
So basically when we say
a gamble is very risky

94
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:47,350
I'm not mathematically
defining anything here.

95
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:50,350
But I just want to throw
out some intuitive concepts.

96
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,450
So a risky gamble
is a gamble where

97
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:56,470
it takes a long time to
converge at your expectation.

98
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,630
But the point is, no matter
how risky it is, eventually

99
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,060
it will get you.

100
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,449
So there's a saying
that death, taxes

101
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:05,240
are the two things that
eventually get you.

102
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,365
As poker players, we would
like to think that three

103
00:04:07,365 --> 00:04:08,660
things eventually get you.

104
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,420
It's death, taxes, and
the law of large numbers

105
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,260
will eventually-- you're going
to reach your [INAUDIBLE]..

106
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,930
So here's another
hypothetical situation.

107
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,310
So let's say you get off
at the wrong bus stop

108
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,781
because you were distracted.

109
00:04:22,781 --> 00:04:24,280
And then you were
upset yourself you

110
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,200
analyze how to not be
distracted in the future

111
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,670
and get off at the
right bus stop.

112
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:30,520
But then after you get
off at the wrong bus stop

113
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,560
you find $1,000 on the ground.

114
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,720
And then you immediately,
you're no longer upset

115
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,550
and you marvel at your riches.

116
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,280
So this is sort of
an absurd story.

117
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,100
But situations like this
happen all the time in poker.

118
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,640
You're going to
make a bad decision

119
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,720
but bad decisions still get a
good result 49% of the time.

120
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,700
And if you make
the right decision

121
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,830
you're still going to get a
bad result 49% of the time.

122
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:58,420
So it's very important
to analyze your decisions

123
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:02,780
without being biased by the
actual outcome that occurred.

124
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,510
So you really want
to be obsessed

125
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:08,140
with this self-improvement,
analyzing your decisions.

126
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,270
If you made $10,000
in a situation

127
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:13,600
where you could have be $12,000
then that's not good enough.

128
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,430
So I want everybody
to think in terms

129
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,585
of what's the maximum
you could of made

130
00:05:17,585 --> 00:05:19,960
and analyzing what's the best
decision you could possibly

131
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,010
have made in every situation.

132
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:25,819
And sometimes it's hard because
if the result is exactly

133
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:27,360
correlated with the
decision then you

134
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,830
can just go back and
look at the result

135
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,900
and know whether you made
a good decision or not.

136
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,210
But that's why learning
poker can sometimes

137
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:36,570
be very, very hard because you
don't have immediate feedback.

138
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:40,100
You're not sure whether
the decision you made

139
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:45,060
is what caused you to make that
money or you just got lucky.

140
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,850
So with that being
said, now let's

141
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,880
talk about some ways to
reason about poker hands.

142
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,380
So roughly there's three levels
of reasoning of poker hands.

143
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,650
Level one my hand
versus your hand.

144
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,640
But by this I mean, you can
see what your cards are.

145
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,070
And you look into
your opponents eyes

146
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:09,210
and you say, OK, I can tell
your cards must be pocket kings

147
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,050
or whatever.

148
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,880
Your hand must beat
this other hand.

149
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,790
And you played your hand
exactly against your opponent's

150
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:17,990
specific hand because you
have a soul read on them.

151
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:21,570
So let's see the
example of this.

152
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:24,360
So we'll watch an episode
of Poker After Dark here.

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,000
but basically she put her
opponent on a specific hand.

175
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,039
She looked at
Patrick and Antonius

176
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,539
and had a feeling
that he had pocket

177
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:39,460
kings for some strange reason.

178
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,720
And then what happened was,
so she had pocket jacks here,

179
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,220
which is a really,
really good hand.

180
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:44,980
It's a full house.

181
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,580
And she just checked the
turn and checked the river

182
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,860
instead of trying to
get Patrick to put

183
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,800
more money in because she
was so certain Patrick

184
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,900
had pocket kings.

185
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,640
Just mathematically
speaking, out of all

186
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,040
the possible combinations
of cards you have,

187
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,750
to put your opponent
specifically

188
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,810
on pocket kings in this
example is basically unfounded.

189
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:09,140
So this gets to
level two reasoning.

190
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,590
So level two
reasoning is my hand

191
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:14,560
versus your range of hands,
versus your probability

192
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,940
distribution of hands.

193
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,730
And another name for this
is exploitative play.

194
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,211
So let's look at
a different hand.

195
00:09:20,211 --> 00:09:21,835
And I'm going to show
you how to reason

196
00:09:21,835 --> 00:09:27,074
about this hand using level
two exploitative reasoning.

197
00:09:27,074 --> 00:09:28,990
So I'm not going to go
through the whole hand.

198
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:31,960
But this is actually a real
hand I played in Macau five,

199
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,890
six years ago.

200
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:37,400
So we get to the river and I
had ace 10 in this situation.

201
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,020
So the pot is 21,000 roughly.

202
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:44,220
And my opponent
bets 8,000-- sorry,

203
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,440
so the pot is 21,000 after
my opponent bets 8,000.

204
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,740
So basically the pot was
13,000 and my opponent

205
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,939
bet 8,000 making it 21,000.

206
00:09:52,939 --> 00:09:55,480
And I have to decide whether to
call with a pretty good hand.

207
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,680
I have a pair of aces here.

208
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,290
But I know my opponent is
[? Rain ?] [? Kahn, ?] who is

209
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,840
a very tight player and
doesn't really like bluffing.

210
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,600
So I don't think he's
really ever bluffing.

211
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,480
If I'm beating him
here it's because he's

212
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,880
betting a hand that
he thinks is good

213
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,320
but is actually worse than
mine, like ace eight basically.

214
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,106
So I model my opponent's range
as ace king through ace eight.

215
00:10:18,106 --> 00:10:19,980
I don't think he has
something even stronger,

216
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,896
like pocket nines because
he would have raised

217
00:10:21,896 --> 00:10:25,870
more earlier in the hand.

218
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:28,090
So let me run through
this calculation

219
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,890
slowly for those of you seeing
pot odd for the first time.

220
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:33,830
So here basically, I want
to think of it like this.

221
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:39,370
The pot, which includes the
8,000 he just put out, is 21.

222
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:43,257
We're considering calling for
8,000 so if we lose, if we call

223
00:10:43,257 --> 00:10:45,340
and her turns up ace king,
which is a better hand,

224
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:49,090
then our net result from this
decision is negative $8,000.

225
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:51,880
If we win and we get our 8,000
back as well as the 21,000

226
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:56,470
in the pot, so we make,
our net is plus 21,000.

227
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:59,110
So therefore, our
win to lose ratio

228
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,720
needs to be at least
8,000 to 21,000 in order

229
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,460
for calling to be
positive expectancy.

230
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,645
So we'll do the
exact calculation.

231
00:11:06,645 --> 00:11:08,020
I'll try to do it
somewhat slowly

232
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,390
to show an example of how
to do this calculation.

233
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:15,850
So essentially what I do
is I count the combinations

234
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,550
of each hand that exists.

235
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:21,490
So ace king, there's
eight combinations

236
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:24,106
because there's two aces
remaining that I haven't seen

237
00:11:24,106 --> 00:11:25,480
and there's four
kings remaining.

238
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,740
So it's two times four,
there's eight combinations.

239
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,580
Same with ace queen,
ace jack, and ace eight.

240
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,400
Ace 10 and ace nine, there's
only six combinations each

241
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,780
because I have the
10, which makes

242
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,140
him having ace 10 less likely.

243
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,360
And for ace nine there's
a nine on the board.

244
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,870
So ace nine is also
slightly less likely.

245
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,640
So ace 10 we actually
get half the pot.

246
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,930
So I'm just going
to roughly make

247
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:52,480
that equivalent to us
winning three of those times

248
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,230
and losing three of
those times, which

249
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,600
is equivalent in expectation.

250
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,880
So basically, if you
do this counting,

251
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,750
there's 33 combinations
that beat us,

252
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,850
there's 11 combinations
that we beat.

253
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:07,155
And so our equity is
basically our probability

254
00:12:07,155 --> 00:12:09,280
of winning, which is
equivalently only the fraction

255
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,380
of the pot that we own.

256
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:14,110
So our equity in
this case is 25%.

257
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:18,190
And the pot odds are 21 to 8.

258
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:22,650
So we need we
basically 1 over 3.56.

259
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:25,180
So 21 to 8 is 2.56 to 1.

260
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:29,355
We need equity 1 over 3.56
to call, which is 28%,

261
00:12:29,355 --> 00:12:29,980
which we don't.

262
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:30,670
So I folded.

263
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:40,205
So unfortunately, this
calculation is a bit ugly.

264
00:12:40,205 --> 00:12:41,330
You just have to do
it a bunch of times

265
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,788
and convince yourself that are
doing the right calculation.

266
00:12:43,788 --> 00:12:46,610
Basically you got to remember to
add one when you're converting

267
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,560
the odds ratio to an equity.

268
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:54,410
So it should be
fairly simple math.

269
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,870
So in this case,
I folded because I

270
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,309
didn't have the desired.

271
00:12:58,309 --> 00:12:59,850
So is there any
questions about that?

272
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:03,080
That was maybe a bit confusing
but I don't know of a great way

273
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:08,750
to show the exact conversion
from pot odds into equity.

274
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,560
But I just want to
point out that they're

275
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,020
slightly different.

276
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:15,260
One is a ratio of when to
lose and one is basically

277
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,160
a fraction of win over
all possible outcomes.

278
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,650
So just don't get
confused by this.

279
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:20,566
That's all I'm saying.

280
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:23,150
I'm going to quickly
interchange between the two

281
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,090
throughout the course.

282
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:26,720
And you should try to get in the
habit of being able to quickly

283
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,761
complete between the two.

284
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,870
So this is an example
of level two reasoning.

285
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:36,800
And hand reading is about using
your opponent's past actions

286
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,720
and your knowledge
of their tendencies

287
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,510
to tweak your probability
distribution of over what

288
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,710
you think their hand is.

289
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:46,130
So hand reading is not
about pegging your opponent

290
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,550
on a specific hand.

291
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,730
It's a marketing message.

292
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,290
Poker players, they
wear sunglasses,

293
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:55,130
they have earplugs to prevent
people from reading their soul.

294
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:57,980
It matters a bit, but
really, these things, things

295
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,200
like I scratched my
ear before I raised,

296
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,780
it should affect your belief
about my cards a very small

297
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:07,460
amount, way less than what
Lady Gaga and the media

298
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,450
makes it seem like.

299
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:15,080
That's how you reason about
a hand exploitatively.

300
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,600
You build a model for
how your opponent behaves

301
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,480
and you make the decision that's
the most positive expectancy

302
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,860
against that model.

303
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,860
And you can go very, very
far with level two reasoning.

304
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:28,830
You can basically build a career
out of level two reasoning.

305
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:31,550
And it's best targeted
towards individual opponents

306
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,140
with specific
tendencies that you're

307
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,589
trying to take advantage of.

308
00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:36,630
So this sounds very good.

309
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,490
This sounds like a
great way to play poker.

310
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:41,980
I figured out what my
opponent's doing right.

311
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,912
I just figured out the
probability distribution

312
00:14:45,912 --> 00:14:47,870
and play in a way make
the most money from him.

313
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:56,070
So does anyone have any problems
with this type of reasoning?

314
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:59,530
So I've got some $20
Amazon gift certificates

315
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,160
from [? Acuma ?] Capital.

316
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,000
Someone can point out
potentially something

317
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,520
you don't like about
this type of reasoning

318
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,162
I'll give you this
gift certificate.

319
00:15:09,162 --> 00:15:10,870
AUDIENCE: You reveal
a lot of information

320
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:14,010
about what your hand is
when you think like this.

321
00:15:16,562 --> 00:15:17,270
PROFESSOR: Right.

322
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,150
But what if your model
incorporates the fact

323
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:22,300
that they are going to behave
based on what they think

324
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,030
is in your hand.

325
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:25,930
Yeah.

326
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:28,430
AUDIENCE: It might take you a
long time to build this model.

327
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:31,430
And if the players leave
your table, or whatever,

328
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,430
you spent like-- because
before you have a model

329
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:36,870
you can't use this
line of reasoning.

330
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,719
So it's expensive to do it.

331
00:15:39,719 --> 00:15:41,010
PROFESSOR: That's a good point.

332
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:44,040
So first of all, level
two reasoning is not easy.

333
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,190
Even though it has flaws, even
playing very good level two,

334
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,210
poker is not easy.

335
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:50,880
Building the model can be very
hard and you could be wrong.

336
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,970
But that's not really
what I'm looking for.

337
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,248
Colin, yeah.

338
00:15:55,248 --> 00:15:59,890
AUDIENCE: Because if your
opponent knows your reasoning

339
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:04,120
then he could maybe bet a
certain way to push it to 28%,

340
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,922
where you'd only call if it's--

341
00:16:06,922 --> 00:16:07,630
PROFESSOR: Right.

342
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:08,129
OK.

343
00:16:08,129 --> 00:16:09,840
Yeah.

344
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,090
I think that's be good enough.

345
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:12,381
I' going to give a certificate.

346
00:16:12,381 --> 00:16:15,420
I'll give it to you at the end.

347
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:19,190
So essentially,
the problem is it's

348
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,352
this assumption-- the
fatal flaw in every plan

349
00:16:21,352 --> 00:16:23,560
is the assumption that you
know more than your enemy.

350
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,560
Does anyone know where
this is from, by the way?

351
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,200
If you do I'll have another
$20 gift certificate.

352
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,660
Does anyone know where
this phrase is from?

353
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,160
Yeah.

354
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,788
AUDIENCE: Is it from Kasowitz?

355
00:16:32,788 --> 00:16:33,371
PROFESSOR: No.

356
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,460
Yeah.

357
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,250
AUDIENCE: The Art of War?

358
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,409
PROFESSOR: No.

359
00:16:41,409 --> 00:16:41,950
No one knows.

360
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,575
I'm going to keep
the gift certificate.

361
00:16:43,575 --> 00:16:45,980
That's OK.

362
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,620
So essentially, the problem
with this line of reasoning

363
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,360
is your opponent does
not play according

364
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,380
to a fixed, static algorithm.

365
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,030
They're also an
intelligent human

366
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:57,140
who's taking this class who's
building all this for you

367
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,690
and adapting the
strategy to beat you.

368
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:02,290
So if you assume your opponent
plays with a fixed strategy,

369
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:05,910
but what if they're
doing the same for you?

370
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:08,510
Now I'm going to get to the
third level of reasoning,

371
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:11,520
which I call optimal play.

372
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,069
So let's analyze the exact
same hand using level three

373
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:14,569
reasoning.

374
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:16,200
So don't get me wrong.

375
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,540
Level two reasoning is great.

376
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,609
If you can do level
two reasoning very well

377
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:21,099
you can make a ton of money.

378
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:23,839
But level three reasoning is
a completely different way

379
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,430
to analyze this hand that can
also make you a lot of money.

380
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:32,300
So level three reasoning I'm
going to think like this.

381
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:35,570
Level three is my range of
hands over your range of hands.

382
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:38,180
So instead of looking
at my specific cards

383
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,000
and figuring out
what my cards are,

384
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,430
I'm actually going to also
put a probability distribution

385
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:47,630
over myself and myself, to
my opponent's eyes, what

386
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,540
is the probability
distribution of my hands?

387
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,730
And in this specific
spot, let's just say,

388
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,410
I decide that my
range in this spot

389
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:56,210
is ace jack through ace seven.

390
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,330
So not including ace nine.

391
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,300
It's basically ace 10,
ace eight, ace seven.

392
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,360
So this is the way to
do the calculation.

393
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,650
So let's just assume I know
my opponent's propensity

394
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:13,870
to bet 1 over 1.6% of
the pot on the river.

395
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:16,050
So the pot was
13,000 on the river

396
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:21,630
and I know that my opponent's
going to bet 8,000.

397
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,302
So I must call with
the frequency such

398
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:26,240
that their EV from
bluffing is zero.

399
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,350
So that's essentially my
goal with optimal play.

400
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,970
So essentially
what I'm saying is,

401
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,560
let's say they have
a really bad hand.

402
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,570
They have like jack 10
for jack high, which

403
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,620
is almost certainly going to
lose the pot if they don't

404
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,870
bet to try to get me to fold.

405
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:42,840
Then I want to call
with the frequency

406
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,180
such that with those
hands, regardless

407
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,880
of whether they bluff,
their expectation is zero.

408
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,170
So how do I do that?

409
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:53,990
I just make my call to
fold ratio 1.6 to 1.

410
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,620
Sorry, in all
these computations,

411
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:59,800
to make it easier,
I'm assuming 1.6

412
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,900
is approximate for the ratio.

413
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:05,520
It's actually 13 over 8.

414
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,920
It actually turned out to
be mostly Fibonacci numbers

415
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,890
so the ratio is around
1.6 to 1 for all of them.

416
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,060
[INAUDIBLE]

417
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:16,170
So my call to fold ratio
needs to be 1.6 to 1

418
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:18,840
so that if they
have that a bad hand

419
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,710
their expectation
from bluffing is zero.

420
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,810
It doesn't matter
whether they bluff.

421
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:29,020
So if I do this calculation
then ace 10-- sorry,

422
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,710
there's a typo--
ace 10 is definitely

423
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:37,020
in the top 61.5% of hands I
can have so I need to call.

424
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,660
So I'm not building a
probability model for them.

425
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,050
What I'm essentially saying is,
if I'm not calling ace 10 here

426
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:46,530
then they can exploit
me by bluffing too much

427
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,420
and I'm just folding
all my hands here.

428
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,180
And they're going to be able
to make money off of me.

429
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:54,000
To prevent this I must
call ace 10, which

430
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,700
is a 61.5 percentile
hand in my range,

431
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,590
so they can't exploit me.

432
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,450
So I'm going to make
an analogy with RPS.

433
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,950
Rock, paper, scissors,
does everyone

434
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,074
know how to play this game?

435
00:20:05,074 --> 00:20:08,180
So you either throw a
rock, scissors, or paper.

436
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,359
So there's no way that you
would not know this game.

437
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:12,650
I know people, if you grew
up in a different background

438
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:13,640
you might call it
something else or you

439
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,960
might have different rules.

440
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,080
But the rules I'm playing
with is rock beats scissors,

441
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,230
scissors beats paper,
and paper beats rock.

442
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:25,137
So exploitative play
you think like this.

443
00:20:25,137 --> 00:20:26,720
You say, since my
opponent just played

444
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,980
rock three times
in a row I think

445
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,750
they're probably not
going to play a rock

446
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,010
a fourth time in a row.

447
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,830
So I'm going to play
scissors because I

448
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,677
know I can't be beaten.

449
00:20:35,677 --> 00:20:37,510
Optimal play just says
I'm going to memorize

450
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,390
a sequence of random
bits and always play

451
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:42,530
each a rock, paper, and
scissors with probably a third.

452
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:46,070
So this is an analogy with
rock, paper, scissors.

453
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:49,090
So one question I often get it
is, if when you play optimally

454
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:50,480
you're making all
your opponent's

455
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,882
decisions the same then your
opponent essentially is never

456
00:20:53,882 --> 00:20:55,340
making a mistake
because regardless

457
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,430
of what they do it's the same.

458
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,539
Then how do you make
money playing optimally?

459
00:20:59,539 --> 00:21:01,080
In rock, paper,
scissors that's true.

460
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,632
If my strategy is just
play rock, paper, scissors,

461
00:21:03,632 --> 00:21:05,090
each with a
probability a third I'm

462
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:07,690
never going to beat you
more often than I should.

463
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:11,420
But in poker there's
enough opportunities

464
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:14,220
to essentially be inconsistent.

465
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,550
For example,
sometimes you will see

466
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:21,922
players fold seven six suited
and then, because later they're

467
00:21:21,922 --> 00:21:23,630
bored and feel like
playing a worse hand,

468
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:27,530
they'll call six five suited in
the exact same situation, which

469
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:31,160
is like basically making a
strictly dominated strategy.

470
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,380
Or like check raising a
circling theory range.

471
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,630
Essentially, a theoretical
optimal strategy you

472
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:39,010
will still extract money slowly
from even the best players.

473
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:41,132
Because even the best
players in poker right now,

474
00:21:41,132 --> 00:21:43,090
there's going to be slight
inconsistencies that

475
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:45,360
are not theoretically optimal.

476
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,975
So the optimal strategy,
another way to think about it

477
00:21:50,975 --> 00:21:53,100
is a Nash equilibrium, if
you've heard of the term.

478
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:57,480
Because the best response
to the optimal strategy

479
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,480
is the optimal strategy itself.

480
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,990
Whereas the best response
to any exploitative strategy

481
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,500
is going to be a
different strategy.

482
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,580
Whenever you play an
exploitative strategy

483
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:09,300
you stand to bee beating
by a different exploitive

484
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,380
strategy that re-exploits you.

485
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,150
This is a defense optimal plays.

486
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:16,390
We play each with
the same probability.

487
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:19,290
Optimal play you're indifferent
to your opponent's move.

488
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:21,690
So optimal play, you're
making a lot of money

489
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:24,300
when your opponent does
something strictly suboptimal.

490
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,000
Whereas in exploitative
play you make a lot of money

491
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,530
when you're winning
the mind games

492
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:30,321
and you lose a lot when
you're losing them.

493
00:22:30,321 --> 00:22:32,667
So exploitative play
is sort of like I

494
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:35,250
know that you know that I know
that you know that I know this.

495
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,333
But you know that I know
that you know that I know

496
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:38,630
that you know that I know this.

497
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:39,880
You get into these mind games.

498
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,056
And if you're good at them
then it's pretty good.

499
00:22:42,056 --> 00:22:43,680
If you're playing
rock, paper, scissors

500
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,680
against a four-year-old
child, probably you

501
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,936
don't want to play optimally.

502
00:22:47,936 --> 00:22:49,560
Probably you want to
look at their face

503
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,268
and try and figure
out what they're going

504
00:22:51,268 --> 00:22:53,400
to do and try to beat them.

505
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,110
But if you're
playing rock, paper,

506
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:58,140
scissors against the rock,
paper, scissors world champion,

507
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:01,302
which there is one
actually, then probably

508
00:23:01,302 --> 00:23:03,510
you just want to memorize
the sequence of random bits

509
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:06,930
and play each
probability a third.

510
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:09,330
So another good thing
about exploitative play

511
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:11,790
is it's intuitive.

512
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,610
We sort of grew up thinking
in terms of exploitative play.

513
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:16,370
I think that's a fair statement.

514
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:19,770
In most things it's like what
do you think might happen?

515
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:22,260
OK, if that might
happen, OK, I'll do this.

516
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,740
But optimal play is sort
of a weird mentality thing

517
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:27,210
because it's sort
of like I'm just

518
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:30,750
going to analyze what my
opponent could potentially do.

519
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,580
So you need an
opponent essentially.

520
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,360
And then I'm just
going to perform

521
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,830
an action that makes it so
that my opponent can't really

522
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,707
beat me.

523
00:23:39,707 --> 00:23:41,790
So that's enough about
those two general concepts.

524
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,620
I'm going to take a short
break right here since it's

525
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,330
good timing.

526
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:48,570
So I'm going to continue and
we'll get in some actual poker.

527
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:52,120
But first we're going
to play one last game.

528
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,620
We're going to play a
game called Who's Taller?

529
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,740
Anyone can join the
content for a dollar.

530
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:00,847
We're not actually having this
so don't get out your wallets.

531
00:24:00,847 --> 00:24:02,430
And then the tallest
person who joined

532
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:03,920
the game gets the entire pot.

533
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,812
So all the people
who join the game,

534
00:24:05,812 --> 00:24:07,520
we're going to measure
who's the tallest,

535
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,605
and then that person
gets everyone's money.

536
00:24:09,605 --> 00:24:10,480
So again, let's play.

537
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,270
So everyone, close your eyes
so that you can't look in here.

538
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,450
Everyone close your eyes.

539
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:14,260
No peeking.

540
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,950
No peeking at how tall--

541
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,980
So I want everyone--
close your eyes.

542
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,890
Is everyone's eyes closed?

543
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:25,020
So put up your hand if you
want to join the contest.

544
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,679
Put it nice and high so
that I can see if you

545
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:28,720
want to join the content.

546
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,495
So raise your hand high.

547
00:24:32,495 --> 00:24:33,050
It's OK.

548
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:33,800
There's no embarrassment.

549
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,420
The whole point of
poker is where--

550
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,300
OK, cool.

551
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,070
So now everyone open your eyes.

552
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,680
So I think five people joined.

553
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,120
So you guys come down here.

554
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,270
Let's see who-- [LAUGHTER]
Let's see who won the pot.

555
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:49,795
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

556
00:24:49,795 --> 00:24:50,670
PROFESSOR: That's OK.

557
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:54,355
It's totally OK if you lost.

558
00:24:54,355 --> 00:24:55,480
So I think the four of you.

559
00:25:02,088 --> 00:25:03,102
Sorry, what's your name?

560
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:03,810
AUDIENCE: Justin.

561
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:04,060
PROFESSOR: OK.

562
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:04,559
Justin.

563
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,180
So I think Justin voted one.

564
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:10,000
So good job Justin,
you would have made $3.

565
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,681
All right.

566
00:25:10,681 --> 00:25:11,180
Cool.

567
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:14,620
So what's the
point of this game?

568
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:17,750
The point of this
game is so from a game

569
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,444
theoretic point of
view no one really

570
00:25:20,444 --> 00:25:21,610
should be playing this game.

571
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:26,830
So this is only known as the
k-beauty game from game theory.

572
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,139
So how tall are you Justin?

573
00:25:28,139 --> 00:25:28,680
JUSTIN: 6'5".

574
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,950
PROFESSOR: 6'5".

575
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:31,649
So why did you play the game?

576
00:25:31,649 --> 00:25:33,940
Because he thought there's
probably someone who's going

577
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:38,830
to be 6'2" who might
play the game, right?

578
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:41,320
But if everyone knew that
if you're only 6'2" you

579
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,611
shouldn't be playing this
game because someone might be

580
00:25:43,611 --> 00:25:46,630
6'5" then you wouldn't play the
game because someone else is

581
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,850
only going to play the
game if they were like

582
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,270
6'8" or something.

583
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,490
So let's say we
played this again.

584
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:57,730
Probably only Justin would play.

585
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:00,310
Eventually this always
devolves into a situation

586
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:02,180
where basically no
one is going to join.

587
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,180
Because you know that no
matter-- even if you're

588
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,580
like seven feet tall,
you're LeBron James,

589
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:09,199
you would know that
someone would only

590
00:26:09,199 --> 00:26:11,740
played this game if they were
the tallest person in the world

591
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,770
essentially.

592
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:15,430
So basically poker
without blinds,

593
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:17,710
which is the money
that's put into the pot

594
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,260
at the start of every
hand, would essentially

595
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,910
be like Who's Taller game.

596
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:24,940
So when you play poker you want
the motivation of every hand

597
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,590
to be stealing the
blinds, stealing

598
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:28,780
the money that was
forced into the pot

599
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,742
without the choice
of the person.

600
00:26:30,742 --> 00:26:32,200
So you would always
fold king king,

601
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,450
which is the second best
hand in poker pre-flop,

602
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:37,480
if there were no blinds.

603
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,310
Suppose we were to play
Who's Taller again.

604
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:43,720
But I told you that I'm going
to force Lee Marie to play.

605
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,710
OK So now we've got
a game because now,

606
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:50,770
even if you're not sure
whether you're the tallest

607
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:54,334
person in the room, if
you're taller then Lee Marie

608
00:26:54,334 --> 00:26:55,750
then you have a
chance of winning.

609
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:59,744
So that's essentially why we
need blinds to have a game.

610
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,450
So you always want to
think how many chips you

611
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:10,150
have in terms of the blinds.

612
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:14,710
So having $400 in front of you
in a game where the blinds are

613
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:17,890
$1 or $2, for our purposes,
is equivalent to having

614
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:20,890
$4,000 in front of
you in a game where

615
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:23,690
the blinds are $10 and $20.

616
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:26,260
Because essentially,
everything you're wagering

617
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:29,290
is relative to stealing
the blinds that were forced

618
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:30,740
into the game at the beginning.

619
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,620
So in both of
these situations we

620
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:37,180
say that you have 200 bets,
or 200 big blinds, or 200 BB.

621
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,580
So that's how to
calculate your stack size.

622
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,400
But what's actually
important isn't stack size

623
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,770
it's effective stack size.

624
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:50,470
So effective stack
size takes into account

625
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:54,730
the stack sizes of the people
remaining in the pot as well.

626
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:59,330
So I'll give an example.

627
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:03,400
So in this case, we're the
player with the ace jack.

628
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,890
And we decided to go all in.

629
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:10,390
So what is our exact stack size?

630
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:14,320
The big blinds is 2,000,
the small blind is 1,000.

631
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,800
And we wagered in total 42,000.

632
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,485
So what's our stack size?

633
00:28:20,485 --> 00:28:22,360
AUDIENCE: 20--

634
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,830
PROFESSOR: 21, right.

635
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:24,995
It's around 21.

636
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:26,740
It's around 21 big blinds.

637
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:30,850
But we didn't really risk
21 big blinds here, did we?

638
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:33,520
Can someone-- OK, I'll give
a $20 gift certificate.

639
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,430
How much did we actually
risk in some sense.

640
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:38,895
Yeah.

641
00:28:38,895 --> 00:28:40,270
AUDIENCE: I can't
see quite well,

642
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:42,670
but I think 12 and
one half big blinds?

643
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:43,900
PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly.

644
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:44,660
I'll remember it.

645
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,630
I'll put it here.

646
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:48,970
So we only risked 12
and a half big blinds

647
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:52,450
because everyone in front
of us has already folded.

648
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:55,210
And the true players behind the
small blind and the big blind,

649
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:57,190
one of them only has 7
and a half big blinds

650
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:59,470
and the other one only has
12 and a half big blinds.

651
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:00,386
Can everyone see that?

652
00:29:00,386 --> 00:29:06,250
So even though UTG plus two
has 32 and a half big blinds

653
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,320
could have
theoretically covered us

654
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,810
and could have theoretically
taken all our money.

655
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:13,060
But on this hand, because
they already folded,

656
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,234
we're essentially only
risking at most 12

657
00:29:15,234 --> 00:29:16,150
and a half big blinds.

658
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,417
That's the most we can lose.

659
00:29:17,417 --> 00:29:19,750
So we can't be eliminated
from the tournament this hand.

660
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,980
So here's another example.

661
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:27,192
So here you see
this guy that I'm

662
00:29:27,192 --> 00:29:28,650
going to call Low
Jack for now, you

663
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:33,110
see him go all in
for 16 big blinds.

664
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:35,590
So in this case, technically
he could lose all his money

665
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:39,650
because we have more than 16
big blinds and we do cover him.

666
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:43,930
But in reality, I'd say
he's probably not on average

667
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:47,860
risking 16 big blinds because
most of the people who

668
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,600
could call him,
other than us, have

669
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,730
way less than 16 big blinds.

670
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:53,350
Does that make sense?

671
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:56,620
So essentially, there's
not like an exact formula

672
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,180
for effective stack size.

673
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,490
But you want to sort of
think of it in terms of you

674
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:02,390
look at the stack
sizes of all the people

675
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:04,690
who could potentially
play the hand against you.

676
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:07,990
And you want to look at
roughly how much am I going

677
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:09,510
to be risking in this hand.

678
00:30:12,114 --> 00:30:13,280
That's effective stack size.

679
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,056
Does that make
sense to everyone?

680
00:30:17,652 --> 00:30:19,610
So the second thing I
want to talk about that's

681
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,410
very important is position.

682
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:24,260
So position is basically
where you are at the table

683
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,610
relative to the blinds.

684
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:27,200
So how many players
are remaining

685
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,660
to compete versus
me for the blinds?

686
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,430
Essentially, the
fewer players that

687
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:35,340
are left the less strong my hand
needs to be attack the blinds.

688
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:38,480
So I'm going to give
names for the positions.

689
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,340
Basically the thing
that matters is how far

690
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,720
you are from the button.

691
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,030
So in this example
with ace jack,

692
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:46,700
when everyone folded
to you and you're

693
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,750
the dealer, which is
also known as the button,

694
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:51,530
essentially to steal
the blinds, you just

695
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:53,650
need to get through the
two blinds themselves.

696
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:55,310
So that's essentially
two players.

697
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,350
And then if you're in
one position earlier,

698
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,240
when it was folded
to cut off, then he

699
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,740
had to deal with three players.

700
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:04,280
So you want to name everything
relative to the dealer

701
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,580
essentially.

702
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,150
So we can just quickly
go through the names.

703
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:11,390
They'll get more
familiar as time goes on.

704
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:14,920
So the first person to act,
we call them under the gun.

705
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,720
So that's this guy here.

706
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,070
And then we go around the table.

707
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:22,060
It's under the gun plus
one, under the gun plus two.

708
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:25,920
There can be different
names for the same position.

709
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:30,620
So in this specific hand, where
there were only six players

710
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:33,922
at the table, you could have
called Low Jack under the gun

711
00:31:33,922 --> 00:31:35,630
because under the gun
is the first person

712
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:37,920
to act to the left
of the big blind.

713
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,454
But essentially, it's
more clear to say Low Jack

714
00:31:40,454 --> 00:31:41,870
because when you
say under the gun

715
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:44,540
you have to say under the
gun at a six-handed table.

716
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,290
And then people will
know that means you

717
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:47,720
got to get through five hands.

718
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,770
But if you say Low
Jack it's very clear.

719
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:51,380
You have to get
through five hands.

720
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:55,700
So under the gun and then
plus two, and then Low Jack.

721
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:59,030
You can also call under the gun
plus two, Low Jack minus one,

722
00:31:59,030 --> 00:31:59,840
if you want.

723
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,322
And then High Jack,
cut off, button.

724
00:32:03,322 --> 00:32:05,030
Don't ask me where
these names came from.

725
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:07,227
I actually have no idea.

726
00:32:07,227 --> 00:32:08,560
And then small blind, big blind.

727
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,480
So that's position.

728
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,990
And the importance of position
is basically the later

729
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:18,404
you are the fewer hands
you got to get through

730
00:32:18,404 --> 00:32:20,820
to steal the button, to steal
the blinds of everyone who's

731
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,280
already folded.

732
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,400
So the third thing that matters
in a poker game is equity.

733
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,100
So we talked about stack size,
we talked about position.

734
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,320
The last thing is
actually your cards.

735
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,840
So the equity of your cards is
basically your secret height

736
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,970
for the Who's Taller game.

737
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:37,345
So you can think
of it like that.

738
00:32:37,345 --> 00:32:38,970
Your cards is like
your secret height.

739
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:41,310
And the probability of
you winning the pot,

740
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:43,110
or equivalently, the
fraction of the pot

741
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:45,150
you would win once the
remaining cards are dealt

742
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:48,200
is called your equity.

743
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,940
So I'm going to give some
examples of calculating equity.

744
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:57,580
So here's an example where
we get it all on the turn.

745
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:00,355
And so I have five four
states spades here.

746
00:33:00,355 --> 00:33:01,990
So I'm not in a great position.

747
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:05,980
But let's count how
many outs I have.

748
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,560
So this one I want to just
name a river card that

749
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,417
would help me win the pot.

750
00:33:10,417 --> 00:33:11,500
AUDIENCE: Seven of spades.

751
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,125
PROFESSOR: Yes.

752
00:33:12,125 --> 00:33:13,250
AUDIENCE: Seven of spades.

753
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,375
PROFESSOR: Seven of spades.

754
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:17,170
So that gives me a straight
and a flush actually.

755
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:18,710
So let's go along those lines.

756
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:21,057
So how many spades are
there left in the deck?

757
00:33:21,057 --> 00:33:22,640
AUDIENCE: There
should be nine spades.

758
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,889
PROFESSOR: Right, nine spades.

759
00:33:23,889 --> 00:33:28,160
And then how many cards help
me make a straight here?

760
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,130
AUDIENCE: Six more.

761
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:30,172
AUDIENCE: Seven or a two.

762
00:33:30,172 --> 00:33:30,880
PROFESSOR: Right.

763
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,000
A seven or a two.

764
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,930
So it's six more because
there's eight sevens and twos.

765
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,850
But I'm double counting
the seven of spades

766
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:38,020
and the two of spades.

767
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,540
So that's nine plus six.

768
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:43,210
And then I actually have
to subtract one more card.

769
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:44,650
Does anyone see what it is?

770
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:45,150
Yeah.

771
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:45,950
AUDIENCE: The queen of spades.

772
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:46,350
PROFESSOR: Right.

773
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:48,141
The queen of spades
because that's actually

774
00:33:48,141 --> 00:33:51,996
a disastrous situation because
then if it wasn't all in I

775
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:54,120
would probably put more
money in the river thinking

776
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,680
I have a flush and
lose to a full house.

777
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:00,040
So it's 14 outs, 17 minus 3.

778
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,350
Our equity is around 32%.

779
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:05,740
It's 14 over the 44 cards
that could still come.

780
00:34:08,406 --> 00:34:09,739
Did that make sense to everyone?

781
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:11,405
So that's one way of
calculating equity.

782
00:34:11,405 --> 00:34:14,050
It's just a very simple
probability distribution

783
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:16,840
over the remaining cards in
the deck that could come.

784
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:20,080
And if you're worried,
what if someone

785
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,618
folded the queen of spades so
I shouldn't be counting that?

786
00:34:22,618 --> 00:34:24,159
Essentially, you
just want to pretend

787
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,674
that the cards that
are in the muck,

788
00:34:25,674 --> 00:34:27,719
like the cards that were
folded by other players,

789
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:30,324
they're essentially irrelevant
because they could have

790
00:34:30,324 --> 00:34:31,449
folded the queen of spades.

791
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:34,260
But they could have also
folded an irrelevant card,

792
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,860
like the jack of
hearts or something.

793
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:38,290
So essentially you just
want to all the cards

794
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:39,909
that you haven't
seen, it's easier

795
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:43,254
to just assume that they
don't affect anything.

796
00:34:43,254 --> 00:34:44,670
In theory they
affect things a bit

797
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:49,379
because if you know that the
dealer button folded two cards,

798
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:50,920
even if you don't
know what they are,

799
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,960
they're probably
more likely to be

800
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,750
really crappy cards, like twos
and threes rather than aces

801
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,958
because if they had an ace
they would have played it.

802
00:34:57,958 --> 00:34:59,950
But I think not worrying
about that is fine.

803
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:02,980
You don't need to
worry about it.

804
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:05,630
Another example of
equity calculation.

805
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:07,880
So it's the exact same
example as before.

806
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,060
But in this case, the
probability distribution

807
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,530
isn't over cards
that could come.

808
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:13,060
All the cards have already come.

809
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:16,750
The probability distribution is
just over my opponent's hand.

810
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:18,730
So this is the same calculation.

811
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:21,970
We calculated our equity is 25%.

812
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:24,040
And that's not a
probability distribution

813
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,290
over cards to come.

814
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,800
That's a probability
distribution

815
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,610
over our beliefs of
our opponent's hand.

816
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:32,290
So example three of
calculating equity.

817
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:35,010
So this one you can't
really do by hand.

818
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:38,280
Let's say you get it all in
pre-flop, with ace king suited

819
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,750
against pocket twos.

820
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:42,659
And you basically
need a calculator.

821
00:35:42,659 --> 00:35:44,700
There are certain websites
that help you do this.

822
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:48,100
And ace king suited
against pocket twos,

823
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,860
if they don't have
a two of your suit

824
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:52,296
is actually a very small
favorite which is cool.

825
00:35:52,296 --> 00:35:53,670
But if you have
the two of hearts

826
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,710
then you're actually
a slight underdog.

827
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:02,000
So just make sure for
all the different things

828
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,420
equity could mean.

829
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:06,570
Equity could mean a probability
over river cards, probability

830
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:07,996
over the unknown.

831
00:36:07,996 --> 00:36:09,370
A very good
calculator in general

832
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:11,370
is PokerStove,
which all have lots

833
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:12,660
of examples of in my slides.

834
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:16,720
And you can download
it via this link here.

835
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,110
So this is an example
of using PokerStove.

836
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,850
You can put in
exact calculations.

837
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:24,090
Let's say you get it in with
two of diamonds, two of spades.

838
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:28,162
So pocket twos on the flop of
5, 3, 2 versus a range where you

839
00:36:28,162 --> 00:36:30,120
know your opponent is
going to have a big pair,

840
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,550
like pocket jacks plus,
you can actually run it

841
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:35,790
and your equity is 85%, which
is actually surprisingly low,

842
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:36,431
I think.

843
00:36:36,431 --> 00:36:38,430
Because it seems like
you've got three of a kind

844
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,660
they've only got a pair.

845
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,580
They have two chances
to hit one of two cards.

846
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,840
But there's a lot of random
stuff that can happen,

847
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,020
like if they have aces
they can make a straight,

848
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,270
they can make a back
door flush, the board

849
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:50,430
could come two more
fives, which counterfeits,

850
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,590
or three of a kind deuces.

851
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:56,280
So this is another example
of calculating equity.

852
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,820
So this is just a summary of
the different situations you

853
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,770
might want to calculate equity.

854
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:03,530
And I recommend you
download PokerStove.

855
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:06,430
But you don't really have to.

856
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:08,520
And I guess one
question you could ask

857
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,980
is how do you actually
do this at a table?

858
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,320
So essentially, if you do
this a lot while you're

859
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,880
studying about
hands and thinking

860
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,540
about poker, eventually--

861
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:19,050
I've been able to-- you just
memorize a lot of situations

862
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:21,090
in general what the
probabilities are,

863
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:25,260
or at least what the
correct decision is.

864
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:30,840
So now let's talk about raising
two win the blinds and antes.

865
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:34,350
So the antes, an ante
is an extra small bet

866
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:37,680
that each player must put
into the pot each hand.

867
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,560
And these sum to
around a big blind.

868
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,070
And they come in during the
later stages of a tournament.

869
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,725
And they're inexistant
in cash games.

870
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:49,965
I stuck this under the rug
in the earlier examples.

871
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:58,580
So in-- let me go
back-- so like in here.

872
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:01,410
Do you see the
1,200 in the middle?

873
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:03,150
So actually stuck
this under the rug.

874
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:05,540
But that comes from
each player being

875
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:09,570
forced to put in 200, which
is 1/10 of the big blind,

876
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:11,110
at the start of every hand.

877
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:13,980
And if you're playing
tournaments then

878
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,990
this would usually be the case.

879
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:17,850
Antes will come in fairly soon.

880
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:20,529
If you're playing cash games,
where you just sit down

881
00:38:20,529 --> 00:38:22,320
and you can leave
whenever and you sit down

882
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,110
and just play for
your own play money,

883
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:27,790
then there's usually no antes.

884
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:29,867
But antes actually make
a world of difference

885
00:38:29,867 --> 00:38:31,200
in terms of what you want to do.

886
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:38,100
It's not just the stakes are
bigger when there's antes

887
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,780
because you don't
want to just think

888
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,390
of it like there's extra
money in the pot every hand.

889
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:44,370
It's equivalent to the
blinds being bigger.

890
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:47,910
That's not true because you
also have to put in an ante.

891
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:50,520
So if the blinds were
proportionally bigger

892
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,790
to cover the antes you would
have to raise to a bigger size

893
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,620
to try to steal the blinds.

894
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:58,500
But with antes you don't need
to raise to any bigger size

895
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,630
to try to steal the blinds.

896
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:01,530
So it's actually
very action driving.

897
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:02,424
It's very exciting.

898
00:39:02,424 --> 00:39:03,840
It makes it so
that your basically

899
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,930
want to play a very
wide range of hands.

900
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:08,910
And you really just
want to be trying

901
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:12,720
to win the blinds as often as
possible because winning one

902
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,440
pot with the antes is so big.

903
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,690
So this is what it looks like.

904
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,240
So the first thing
I'm going to say

905
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,531
is if you're going to start
playing tournaments tonight

906
00:39:23,531 --> 00:39:26,679
is if no one has raised yet you
really, you don't want to call.

907
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:28,220
You want it to raise
to give yourself

908
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:30,630
a chance of winning the
blinds without seeing a flop.

909
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:32,970
So I'd say the most
common beginner mistake

910
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:37,260
I see beginner poker
players make is not raising

911
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,940
when no one has raised before.

912
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:43,740
So in this case, it would
be just calling for 2,000

913
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:44,970
and trying to see a flop.

914
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:46,890
But the main issue
is you're giving

915
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:49,380
the big blind they
can just check and see

916
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,490
the flop for free.

917
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:52,640
Whereas if you raise you
put them to a decision.

918
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,940
And they might fold,
and you might just

919
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,480
win the pot for
free without having

920
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,230
to do anything essentially.

921
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:01,380
So how much do you
raise when I say raise.

922
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,910
The minimum raise
size you can do

923
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:05,440
is raising to two big blinds.

924
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,470
However, this is a
bit small because you

925
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:10,950
give the blinds fairly good
odds to make a profitable call.

926
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,890
Although, it's
not even that bad.

927
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:16,140
So let me just talk in
general about raising

928
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,760
big versus raising small.

929
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,190
So the advantage
of raising small

930
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:21,900
is that you're risking less.

931
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,530
Like let's say you raise and
then the next person re-raises,

932
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:26,490
and then the next
person goes all in.

933
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:29,870
So you know probably those two
people have pretty good hands

934
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:30,960
and you want to fold.

935
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,340
If you raise to a small
size then you can fold

936
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,070
and you don't lose that much.

937
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:39,040
If I raise to five big blinds
then I'm losing a lot more.

938
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,190
But what's the
benefit of raising big

939
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:44,490
is you give other people
worse odds to call.

940
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:46,272
If I only raise
to two big blinds,

941
00:40:46,272 --> 00:40:47,730
let's actually do
this calculation.

942
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:50,040
Let's say here, instead
of going all in I

943
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,360
raise two big blinds,
which is 4,000.

944
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,990
What odds am I
essentially giving

945
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:57,330
the big blind you call to call?

946
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:03,210
So this is actually, in
this very exact situation,

947
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,910
this is a very common
mistake I see beginners make,

948
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:09,100
which is you raise
to only 4,000.

949
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:09,880
Yeah.

950
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,450
AUDIENCE: So there's
8,000 that's in the pot

951
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:14,152
and they have to call
2,000, so it's 21?

952
00:41:14,152 --> 00:41:14,860
PROFESSOR: Right.

953
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:15,419
So it's 41.

954
00:41:15,419 --> 00:41:16,710
But there's also a small blind.

955
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:20,050
So there's actually going to be
9,000 essentially in the pot.

956
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:20,880
Yeah.

957
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,200
So it's going to be 8,800 in.

958
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,158
It's going to be 8,800.

959
00:41:23,158 --> 00:41:24,990
So approximately 9,000.

960
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:27,285
And they only have to
call 2,000 to see the pot.

961
00:41:27,285 --> 00:41:30,190
Does that make
sense to everyone?

962
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:32,910
So the odds are
actually 4.5 to 1.

963
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:35,530
And ace jack off-suit
is a great hand.

964
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:38,820
But there's no
hand that ace jack

965
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:43,680
off-suit is more than a
4.5 to 1 favorite against.

966
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,920
So in some sense, basically,
even if they have jacks two,

967
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:50,880
or whatever, ace two, think
of the best possible case,

968
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,110
you're still not doing
better than the odds

969
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:53,955
you're giving them.

970
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:00,590
So on the other hand
though, it is really risky

971
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:01,990
to raise more than 2.25.

972
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:04,826
So a reasonable rule
of thumb, I'd say,

973
00:42:04,826 --> 00:42:08,209
is to raise to the 2.25
big blinds in tournaments.

974
00:42:08,209 --> 00:42:09,500
I know it's pretty close to do.

975
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,680
If you just raised to two
it's probably not that bad.

976
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,210
But roughly speaking,
I think this

977
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:16,310
is a reasonable rule of thumb.

978
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:18,080
Earlier you could
try to raise to more.

979
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,640
I think that's
sort of customary,

980
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:23,210
although I don't think
it's theoretically optimal.

981
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:25,030
You'll often see
players raise to like

982
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:28,000
three blinds, especially
when you watch pro players.

983
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,120
They'll raise to bigger.

984
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,800
But the main reason
is because they're

985
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,720
the better player by
a lot and they're just

986
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,660
trying to make big pots,
which is reasonable.

987
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:38,370
If you're trying to
just play big pots

988
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:41,270
and win big pots then raising
to the bigger size is fine.

989
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:43,490
But I don't think there's
any theoretical reason

990
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:49,340
to raise to more than 2.25
big blinds in most situations.

991
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:53,600
Other than when in cash
games, where all players have

992
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,340
a lot of money, then
it's a bit different

993
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,714
because also in
cash games you're

994
00:42:56,714 --> 00:42:59,930
not worried about risking
more because you're not

995
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:03,710
worried about losing
out of the tournament.

996
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:07,520
So the other thing is instead
of raising you should just

997
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:12,830
go all in if the effective stack
size is 12 big blinds or less.

998
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:15,365
So recall, the rational
for raising big

999
00:43:15,365 --> 00:43:17,510
is to prevent others
from calling for cheap.

1000
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:19,130
But the rational
for raising small

1001
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,830
is to lose less if we get
re-raised and have to fold.

1002
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:24,950
But 12 big blinds is sort of the
point where it's small enough

1003
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:27,500
that you never really want
to fold after committing

1004
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,180
2.25 big blinds.

1005
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:32,430
So if I only have 12 big
blinds, I raise 2.25,

1006
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:36,660
I've only got 9.75 left after.

1007
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:39,440
OK, fine, if I get raises and
re-raised maybe I'll fold.

1008
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,080
But even if I get
re-raised once,

1009
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,120
if I'm raising in
the first place

1010
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,850
my hand is going
to be reasonable.

1011
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:48,320
If it's a Who's
Taller game I'm not

1012
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,270
going to raise in
the first place

1013
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:52,760
if I'm 5 feet, or something.

1014
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:56,360
So your hand will be reasonable.

1015
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:00,260
So this is beginner mistake
number two is being too scared

1016
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:01,310
to go all in pre-flop.

1017
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:05,240
So that's why this ace jack
hand, I actually cheated a bit.

1018
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:08,030
So technically here, the
effective stack size is--

1019
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:11,420
the big blind has 12
and a half big blinds

1020
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:13,550
but the small one
only has 7 and a half.

1021
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:17,930
So I roughly said, the effective
stack size is less than 12,

1022
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:19,864
and I just went all in.

1023
00:44:19,864 --> 00:44:21,780
So that's definitely a
beginner mistake number

1024
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:27,920
two in tournaments is to be too
scared to go all in pre-flop.

1025
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,370
So what your goal essentially
should be-- oh, sorry.

1026
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:33,680
I should say the rule is--

1027
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,350
so all of the numbers I
said assume there's antes.

1028
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:39,140
If there's no antes you should
change to 10 big blinds.

1029
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:41,180
So the threshold
for going all in

1030
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:43,807
should be less because
when there's no antes

1031
00:44:43,807 --> 00:44:46,098
you want to be risking less
because the pot is smaller.

1032
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:52,200
So overall, when I
talked about position

1033
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,975
I talked about stack size.

1034
00:44:53,975 --> 00:44:56,100
Essentially what I'm trying
to get the point across

1035
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,770
is if you're just
starting out, players

1036
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:01,230
tend to make all decisions
based on their cards.

1037
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:03,390
It's just like, I
have a pair of jacks.

1038
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:04,980
I see my pair of
jacks on this board.

1039
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:06,540
I have a pair
that's pretty good.

1040
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:09,900
And you sort of tend to ignore
what the effect of stack size

1041
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:12,370
is, how much you're
wagering, and position.

1042
00:45:12,370 --> 00:45:14,460
But experienced
players, the cards

1043
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:16,530
actually matter much,
much less to the.

1044
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:19,590
In fact, if you're
doing optimal play

1045
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:21,720
you don't care in some
sense what your cards are.

1046
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:25,990
You just care what your range
of cards are at that point.

1047
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:28,620
So experienced players, they're
willing to raise the blinds

1048
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:31,890
with much weaker hands
from good positions rather

1049
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:32,847
than early positions.

1050
00:45:32,847 --> 00:45:34,680
And they're going to
risk going all in a lot

1051
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,390
more frequently with
a lot worse hands

1052
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:37,744
if their stack size is low.

1053
00:45:37,744 --> 00:45:39,160
So I want you to
think about that.

1054
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,400
So if you're just
starting out that's fine.

1055
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,140
If you're still
trying to figure out

1056
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:45,280
whether you have a straight and
stuff like that, that's fine.

1057
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,950
And it's totally fine
if you try to play

1058
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:48,270
based just on your cards.

1059
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:50,550
But I want everyone's goal
by the end of the class

1060
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:53,700
to be able to play based
on these other factors

1061
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:56,322
more so than your cards.

1062
00:45:56,322 --> 00:45:58,030
So that being said,
I'm going to give you

1063
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:01,150
some concrete suggestions
for those of you

1064
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:03,530
who might want to start
playing tonight of what hands

1065
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:07,830
you should be playing
from each position.

1066
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:12,240
So most of the tournaments will
have nine players per table.

1067
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,610
So this is going to be roughly
a range I recommend to open.

1068
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:17,080
So these are the
range of hands you

1069
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:20,450
should be playing from
the worst position,

1070
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:22,220
so under the gun at
a nine-handed table.

1071
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:24,050
So there's eight
players left behind you.

1072
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:25,540
You can pick up
really good hands.

1073
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:29,070
So it's aces, kings, queens,
jacks; ace king off-suited;

1074
00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:33,720
ace king off-suit; 10s; ace
queen suited; ace queen off.

1075
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,950
So that's basically
the list of hands.

1076
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:38,230
These are only premium hands.

1077
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:41,580
This is like 6.2%
of hands, I think.

1078
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:43,370
It's a very premium range.

1079
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:45,460
So note how tight this is.

1080
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,680
Because the thing to
remember is only the best

1081
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:53,980
hand out of nine hands at the
table is going to get the pot.

1082
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:56,980
When there's nine hands, even
though the average hand is

1083
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,224
really bad the best
hand out of nine hands

1084
00:46:59,224 --> 00:47:00,640
is always going
to be pretty good.

1085
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,880
So to even think that you have
a chance you need to start out

1086
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,250
with a very premium hold 'em.

1087
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:10,780
Roughly, what do you add
as you go around the table?

1088
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:12,077
So for the second position--

1089
00:47:12,077 --> 00:47:14,410
I'm going to post all these
slides before the tournament

1090
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:15,201
starts, by the way.

1091
00:47:15,201 --> 00:47:17,020
So you don't feel
that you scramble

1092
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:18,850
to write all this down.

1093
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:21,790
I'm going to post it.

1094
00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:25,510
From the second position,
I put in black the hands

1095
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:27,550
that I would open from
the previous position.

1096
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:29,770
And I've put in red the
hands that I would open

1097
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:31,810
from that position in addition.

1098
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:33,740
So second position
there's one less player.

1099
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:34,240
OK.

1100
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,270
I'll gamble with sevens, ace,
jack, king, queen, ace 10

1101
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:37,950
suited.

1102
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:39,790
So we'll get around
the table and then

1103
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:44,000
the range will slowly increase.

1104
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,830
Also note that these are
very conservative ranges.

1105
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:51,380
If you watch high stakes
poker, probably the players

1106
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:54,520
will open a lot more hands than
what I'm recommending here.

1107
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,890
But my general
experience has been

1108
00:47:56,890 --> 00:47:59,050
when you're just starting
out to play poker

1109
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:01,690
it's much easier to err
on the side of being

1110
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:04,140
too tight than being too loose.

1111
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:06,730
Because it's in some
sense a lot easier

1112
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:09,520
to play pocket aces
than seven five suited.

1113
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,020
With pocket aces
you're always going

1114
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:12,394
to have a pair of
aces or better.

1115
00:48:12,394 --> 00:48:14,434
You just back that bet.

1116
00:48:14,434 --> 00:48:15,850
And then with seven
five suite you

1117
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:18,160
need to be able to
bluff very carefully,

1118
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,406
you need to sometimes be able to
try to get value when you just

1119
00:48:21,406 --> 00:48:22,280
hit a pair of sevens.

1120
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,190
And it's just a lot harder.

1121
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:26,740
So the ranges I'm
suggesting are very

1122
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:28,770
tight by most poker standards.

1123
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:30,700
By tight I mean conservative.

1124
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,290
But I think that's
the right side

1125
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:35,130
to err on when
you're just starting.

1126
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:38,230
So these are the ranges.

1127
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:40,580
As we get to the later
positions, so this is Low Jack,

1128
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:42,960
we're opening more hands now.

1129
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,440
Any two suited Broadways.

1130
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,010
So that's hands like jack
10 suited, queen 10 suited.

1131
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:48,400
It's basically
any two cards that

1132
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,281
are the same suit and
both 10 or higher.

1133
00:48:52,281 --> 00:48:54,280
So maybe I should just
run through this quickly.

1134
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:57,532
So why is having your
cards be suited good?

1135
00:48:57,532 --> 00:49:00,172
AUDIENCE: You get a flush.

1136
00:49:00,172 --> 00:49:00,880
PROFESSOR: Right.

1137
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,005
So if it suited you're more
likely to make a flush.

1138
00:49:03,005 --> 00:49:05,260
But if have two unsuited
cards then there's

1139
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:07,200
two different flushes
you could get.

1140
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,710
If you have queens or
diamonds, 10 of spades

1141
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:14,470
is going to make a diamond
flush or a spade flush.

1142
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:16,360
Essentially, that
argument is wrong

1143
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,280
because there's two
reasons why it's wrong.

1144
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,830
One is it's not more of a
play because you need four

1145
00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:22,900
of the suit to make a flush.

1146
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:26,300
And two is, when you make the
flush it's also more obvious

1147
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:27,760
you have the flush.

1148
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:28,260
like

1149
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:29,980
If you only have
one diamond, even

1150
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:32,030
if it's the ace of
diamonds, once there's

1151
00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:34,180
four diamonds on the
board it's way more likely

1152
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,099
that you have a flush.

1153
00:49:35,099 --> 00:49:36,640
So you're going to
get paid off less.

1154
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,067
Whereas if you have two
diamonds in your hand

1155
00:49:39,067 --> 00:49:40,900
and there's only three
diamonds on the board

1156
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:43,360
it's less susceptible
that you have a flush.

1157
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,920
So high jack is
three to the button.

1158
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,680
So this is what I
would recommend.

1159
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:57,530
So any pair, pairs
are pretty good.

1160
00:49:57,530 --> 00:50:00,010
Any suited ace, so
suited ace means any card

1161
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:03,040
with any hand with an ace and
another card of the same suit.

1162
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,840
Any suited connector.

1163
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:08,020
By that I mean hands
like basically two cards

1164
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:11,900
that are next to each other and
also the same suit, like 10,

1165
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:12,400
9--

1166
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,960
10 of spades, nine of spades.

1167
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:17,320
Or any two unsuited
Broadway cards.

1168
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:20,000
So I do use a lot
of terminology here.

1169
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,597
So yeah, please stop me
if something is unclear.

1170
00:50:23,597 --> 00:50:25,180
You can google most
of these, I think.

1171
00:50:33,509 --> 00:50:34,800
And suited connectors are good.

1172
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,910
So like a hand like
seven, six suited

1173
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:40,297
is often better than a
hand like 10, 6 suited,

1174
00:50:40,297 --> 00:50:42,130
even though the trend
is bigger than the six

1175
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:44,485
because ten is sort of a
small enough card where

1176
00:50:44,485 --> 00:50:47,020
it's not that relevant, the
fact that it's a big card.

1177
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:48,960
But the fact that
seven, six is connected

1178
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,774
and can hit a lot more
straights is very relevant.

1179
00:50:52,774 --> 00:50:54,190
So we're if we're
cut off I'm just

1180
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:56,148
going to show you on
PokerStove because there's

1181
00:50:56,148 --> 00:50:57,090
too many to list.

1182
00:50:57,090 --> 00:50:59,620
But the thing I want you
to know is the percentages.

1183
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:01,130
30%.

1184
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:04,380
So remember, under the gun
I recommended playing 6%.

1185
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:08,070
So we've multiplied
how bad our hand could

1186
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:10,050
be for us to play by five.

1187
00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:13,030
And I think this is what I
really want you to try to do.

1188
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:14,640
And I think what a
lot of new players

1189
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,181
don't do enough is they always
play the same cards regardless

1190
00:51:17,181 --> 00:51:17,969
of their position.

1191
00:51:17,969 --> 00:51:19,510
And then even crazier,
on the button,

1192
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:21,340
if everyone in
front of you folds,

1193
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:24,210
I recommend them playing
about 55% of hands.

1194
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:24,990
This is huge.

1195
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:27,540
I want you to play
jack three suited.

1196
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:30,110
Who thinks jack three
suited is a good hand?

1197
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:33,430
Or king four off-suit,
or queen six off-suit.

1198
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,670
What hands do we play
from the small blind

1199
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:40,920
if it's folded to you?

1200
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:44,070
So let's compare opening from
the small blind to opening

1201
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:44,757
from the button.

1202
00:51:44,757 --> 00:51:46,590
So for small blind it's
a bit different now.

1203
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:51,840
So I should mention
this because when

1204
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:56,550
you're raising from the button,
from the dealer, if you get

1205
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:59,737
called you get to
act last post-flop.

1206
00:51:59,737 --> 00:52:02,070
So I'm going to talk more
about this in future lectures.

1207
00:52:02,070 --> 00:52:06,030
But this is basically called
having position post-flop.

1208
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:08,090
And having position
is basically good.

1209
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:08,637
Yeah.

1210
00:52:08,637 --> 00:52:10,220
AUDIENCE: For all
these hands, are you

1211
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:12,140
assuming that everyone's
folding behind you?

1212
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:13,440
PROFESSOR: Yes, yes.

1213
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,117
If people haven't
folded, essentially, I'll

1214
00:52:16,117 --> 00:52:17,700
talk more about this
in future classes

1215
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:20,130
but essentially what
you need to do if--

1216
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:24,480
so let let's say this guy
raised and you're the button.

1217
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:28,230
Essentially you need to
consider what his range is

1218
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:30,410
and calculate your equity
against his range, which

1219
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:30,910
you can do--

1220
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:32,620
AUDIENCE: The calculation
is completely different.

1221
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:33,260
PROFESSOR: Right.

1222
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:35,093
So the calculation is
essentially completely

1223
00:52:35,093 --> 00:52:36,120
different.

1224
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:39,690
So essentially the
first guy who raised

1225
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:42,845
determines what the barrier
to entry to the pot is.

1226
00:52:42,845 --> 00:52:44,220
Because essentially
the first guy

1227
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:47,340
that raises, if it's from under
the gun, he's telling you,

1228
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:49,234
my range is pocket eights plus.

1229
00:52:49,234 --> 00:52:50,775
Even if he's sort
of loose it's still

1230
00:52:50,775 --> 00:52:55,650
going to be pocket fours plus
and queen 10 suited plus.

1231
00:52:55,650 --> 00:53:00,240
Basically it's saying, if you're
playing eight six suited then

1232
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:03,210
you're basically in
idiot, because my range is

1233
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:04,090
way better than that.

1234
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:07,140
So essentially the first guy
who plays this hand sort of

1235
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:10,820
sets the tone on how good
your hand needs to be.

1236
00:53:17,049 --> 00:53:18,090
Thanks for that question.

1237
00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:20,131
So I'll talk more about
this in a future lecture.

1238
00:53:20,131 --> 00:53:24,120
But essentially that's
what you need to do.

1239
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:27,200
So from the small blind let's
compare opening the small blind

1240
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,830
from opening the button.

1241
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:30,970
So the issue with
opening the small blind

1242
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:32,671
is if the big blind
calls you actually

1243
00:53:32,671 --> 00:53:33,920
don't have position post-flop.

1244
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,040
The big blind gets to
act after you post-flop.

1245
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:36,660
Pot.

1246
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:38,700
So it's actually a lot
worse in some sense

1247
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,366
than opening from the
button because you

1248
00:53:40,366 --> 00:53:41,370
don't get you act last.

1249
00:53:41,370 --> 00:53:44,530
But it is better in the sense
that there's one fewer person

1250
00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:45,330
to get through.

1251
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:47,880
And also, you have less to
wager, which is actually

1252
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:51,510
really relevant because
from the button,

1253
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:57,910
if the blinds are 2,000 or 1,000
or OK, let's just dictate it.

1254
00:53:57,910 --> 00:53:59,790
So if the blinds
are 20, 40, if you

1255
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:02,730
want to steal the lines from the
button and you want to do 2.25

1256
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:04,080
you need to put in 90.

1257
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:06,530
You raise me 90 and
you need to wager 90.

1258
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:08,280
But if you're raising
from the small blind

1259
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,500
you only need to put in 70 more.

1260
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,540
So you're actually
paying a smaller price

1261
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,414
to try to steal the blinds.

1262
00:54:14,414 --> 00:54:16,080
But the fact that
you're out of position

1263
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:18,212
is a very important negative.

1264
00:54:18,212 --> 00:54:19,920
So I'd say all these
factors balance out.

1265
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,140
And you can roughly play
the same range of hands

1266
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:24,570
from the small blind as you
would from the big blind.

1267
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:26,984
I think that's a
reasonable rule of thumb.

1268
00:54:26,984 --> 00:54:28,650
But the fact that
you're out of position

1269
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:31,770
hurts a lot less as stacks
get shallower, essentially

1270
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:35,900
as effective stack
sizes get a lot smaller.

1271
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:39,200
So you could really
drastically increase this range

1272
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:42,726
if you only have 10 big
blinds from the small blind.

1273
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:48,050
So let me just give a
few caveats about this.

1274
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:49,675
So actually, I'll
leave it to you guys.

1275
00:54:49,675 --> 00:54:51,620
If someone comes up with
a very good complaint

1276
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:53,810
about these recommendations
I'm giving you

1277
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:57,120
I'll give up the
last $20 gift card.

1278
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,447
So what are some problems?

1279
00:54:59,447 --> 00:55:01,530
Normally I get lots of
complaints in this section.

1280
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:03,420
You already got one
but you can answer.

1281
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:04,000
Yeah.

1282
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,204
AUDIENCE: They're very
predictable so it's unusable.

1283
00:55:07,204 --> 00:55:07,870
PROFESSOR: Good.

1284
00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:09,026
That's a very good point.

1285
00:55:09,026 --> 00:55:11,150
A lot of people ask me,
why would you follow these?

1286
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:13,310
If I follow these everyone
knows what I'm doing.

1287
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:19,690
Well the point is, for most
of these, even this range,

1288
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:21,950
it sort of encompasses
enough hands.

1289
00:55:21,950 --> 00:55:25,280
So this is where I'm talking
about optimal balance play.

1290
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,100
I think even though humans
haven't solved poker,

1291
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:31,100
I think roughly,
if you want to ask,

1292
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:34,720
I would guess that roughly
the optimal range of hands

1293
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,851
you open from this position
is something like this.

1294
00:55:36,851 --> 00:55:37,850
It's going to be looser.

1295
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:39,920
But it's something
roughly like this.

1296
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:44,180
Probably you want to
probabilistic play some smaller

1297
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:46,980
cards just so when the
flop comes 2, 2, 4,

1298
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:48,382
you can potentially have a two.

1299
00:55:48,382 --> 00:55:50,090
But essentially you're
not doing bad here

1300
00:55:50,090 --> 00:55:53,712
because if the flop comes
three small cards then

1301
00:55:53,712 --> 00:55:55,670
you were going to be
doing pretty well with all

1302
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:56,930
your big pairs.

1303
00:55:56,930 --> 00:55:58,940
And if the flop
comes the big cards

1304
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:04,630
you've still got ace king, ace
queen, ace jack in your hand.

1305
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:10,520
But not that is
a good complaint.

1306
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:13,450
So in theory, it's
in theory optimal

1307
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:16,630
to play seven seven some
fraction of the time,

1308
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:18,330
six six some
fraction of the time,

1309
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:20,060
and two two some
fraction of the time.

1310
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:23,286
But that's making things
really complicated.

1311
00:56:23,286 --> 00:56:24,910
I don't want to add
two two to the list

1312
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:26,900
because if you play two
two every single time

1313
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:28,070
then that's way too loose.

1314
00:56:28,070 --> 00:56:30,440
You're just spewing money
by raising with two two

1315
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,810
against this many
players behind.

1316
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:34,580
So ideally maybe
with two twos you

1317
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:37,242
should do a random
number generator and 10%

1318
00:56:37,242 --> 00:56:38,450
of the time you play two two.

1319
00:56:38,450 --> 00:56:40,870
That would probably be
theoretically optimal.

1320
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:42,594
OK, good.

1321
00:56:42,594 --> 00:56:43,760
That would have gotten this.

1322
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:44,800
But OK, I'll give it to--

1323
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:45,274
Yeah.

1324
00:56:45,274 --> 00:56:47,482
AUDIENCE: I think another
problem with playing really

1325
00:56:47,482 --> 00:56:50,070
tight all the time is that
you are also very easily

1326
00:56:50,070 --> 00:56:51,870
bullied around the table.

1327
00:56:51,870 --> 00:56:54,386
If someone bets and you
really want to play,

1328
00:56:54,386 --> 00:56:56,760
you really want to stick to
your tight range, you'll fold

1329
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,860
and you'll maybe
miss out on something

1330
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:00,535
that you shouldn't
have depending

1331
00:57:00,535 --> 00:57:02,160
on your position,
and things like that.

1332
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:02,430
PROFESSOR: OK.

1333
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:02,930
Good.

1334
00:57:02,930 --> 00:57:06,560
So yes, these are
pretty tight in that it

1335
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,450
does give the other
people incentive

1336
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:10,100
to raise a lot
because everyone's

1337
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:12,350
going to be folding a lot
because you are just waiting

1338
00:57:12,350 --> 00:57:14,260
for these really good hands.

1339
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:15,170
OK.

1340
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:17,361
That's good.

1341
00:57:17,361 --> 00:57:19,652
Are there any other questions
about these suggestions I

1342
00:57:19,652 --> 00:57:21,500
gave you guys?

1343
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:25,104
Or are there other
potential complaints?

1344
00:57:25,104 --> 00:57:27,020
I'm going to give this
gift certificate to you

1345
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:32,520
unless someone thinks that
they have another complaint.

1346
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,762
So I'll give this
to you at the end.

1347
00:57:42,330 --> 00:57:45,450
This is one thing that
I didn't really address.

1348
00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:48,780
I talked about going all
in as well as just raising.

1349
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:52,130
So how do these ranges differ?

1350
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:55,610
The answer essentially is
they don't really differ.

1351
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:58,484
So let's say, here, these are
the hands I told you to play.

1352
00:57:58,484 --> 00:58:00,150
Let's say you were
sort of small enough,

1353
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:03,294
you only had 12 big
blinds with antes

1354
00:58:03,294 --> 00:58:04,710
and you were
supposed to go all in

1355
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:07,920
instead of raise, which of these
hands do you go all in with?

1356
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:10,807
It's roughly the same range.

1357
00:58:10,807 --> 00:58:12,390
I think that's a
decent rule of thumb.

1358
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:14,460
If you just go all in
with the same range

1359
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:17,850
you're not going
to be doing badly.

1360
00:58:17,850 --> 00:58:20,790
But when the effective
stack size is much smaller,

1361
00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:22,860
like let's say you only
have three big blinds,

1362
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:26,850
then you can drastically
increase this range.

1363
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:29,250
So when your
effective stack size

1364
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:33,910
is actually say 10, or let's
say your effective stack size is

1365
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:39,110
five big blinds, intuitively you
might think, I can wager a lot,

1366
00:58:39,110 --> 00:58:41,570
I can wager a lot
wider range of hands.

1367
00:58:41,570 --> 00:58:42,690
So here's the argument.

1368
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:46,740
The argument is I'm only
risking five big blinds.

1369
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:50,070
In the other case I was
risking 12 big blinds.

1370
00:58:50,070 --> 00:58:53,350
I should be way more
aggressive with five big blinds

1371
00:58:53,350 --> 00:58:54,840
than 12 big blinds.

1372
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:55,830
So that's the argument.

1373
00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:57,660
But the reason why
that argument is wrong

1374
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,610
is because with five
big blinds you're

1375
00:58:59,610 --> 00:59:01,242
going to get called every time.

1376
00:59:01,242 --> 00:59:02,700
With five big blinds
you can't just

1377
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:04,260
go all in with
seven two off-suit

1378
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:06,480
because your opponent has
such good odds to call,

1379
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:07,620
they're going to call you.

1380
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:10,470
Whereas with 12 big blinds,
even though you're risking more

1381
00:59:10,470 --> 00:59:13,140
you also have more chances
of getting everyone to fold.

1382
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:15,400
So even though it seems like
you're risking way more,

1383
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,860
in some sense you're not.

1384
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:19,380
Because the more chips you
are risking the more likely

1385
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:21,490
it is that everyone else folds.

1386
00:59:21,490 --> 00:59:23,620
Does that argument
make sense to everyone?

1387
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:24,750
So make sure you don't
get tricked by that

1388
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:26,166
because it is easy
to get tricked.

1389
00:59:26,166 --> 00:59:29,910
But the fact that when
you're risking more

1390
00:59:29,910 --> 00:59:31,500
you're getting
people to fold more

1391
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:32,880
means you're
actually not risking

1392
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,970
as much as you think you are.

1393
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:36,420
And that's a common fallacy.

1394
00:59:41,590 --> 00:59:43,330
So we're near the last
part of the class.

1395
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:44,980
So are there any
other questions?

1396
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:47,396
I know some of you probably
want to start playing tonight,

1397
00:59:47,396 --> 00:59:51,640
and I definitely did not
address everything you need.

1398
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:53,830
But are there any
other questions

1399
00:59:53,830 --> 00:59:55,660
roughly, in terms
of opening and going

1400
00:59:55,660 --> 01:00:01,114
all in that you might want to
know before playing tonight?

1401
01:00:01,114 --> 01:00:03,280
Because I do think we have
maybe five extra minutes.

1402
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:04,995
So I can answer some questions.

1403
01:00:04,995 --> 01:00:07,120
Does everyone not know what
the term "bluff" means?

1404
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:08,578
I said bluff a
bunch of times but I

1405
01:00:08,578 --> 01:00:09,850
realized I never explained.

1406
01:00:09,850 --> 01:00:14,890
So bluffing essentially
means you have a bad hand

1407
01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:16,810
and because you have
such a bad hand you

1408
01:00:16,810 --> 01:00:19,450
know the only way of winning
that is to get your opponent

1409
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:20,320
fold.

1410
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:24,250
So basically you bet big to
hope that your opponent folds.

1411
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:26,500
If you have a better hand,
like an average hand,

1412
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,660
often you actually
don't want to be betting

1413
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:29,754
because there's no point.

1414
01:00:29,754 --> 01:00:31,920
Because when you bet you're
essentially just getting

1415
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,359
adversely selected, where
your opponent calls you

1416
01:00:34,359 --> 01:00:36,400
when their hand is better
and you lose more money

1417
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,261
to a better hand.

1418
01:00:37,261 --> 01:00:39,260
And your opponent folds
when their hand is worse

1419
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:41,590
so you're not making any
money from a worse hand.

1420
01:00:41,590 --> 01:00:43,030
And then with your
best hands, you

1421
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:45,880
want to bet to try to get your
opponent to call and increase

1422
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:47,290
the amount that you win.

1423
01:00:47,290 --> 01:00:48,850
And we call this value betting.

1424
01:00:48,850 --> 01:00:52,169
So I'm going to get more
into this in future lechers.

1425
01:00:52,169 --> 01:00:54,460
But essentially in poker,
the paradigm you want to play

1426
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:57,610
is you want to value
bet your very best hands

1427
01:00:57,610 --> 01:00:59,810
and then you want to
basically check and try

1428
01:00:59,810 --> 01:01:03,010
to get to show down, like try
to show your hand on the river

1429
01:01:03,010 --> 01:01:04,390
with your medium hands.

1430
01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:07,165
And also bet with your bad hands
to try to get your opponent

1431
01:01:07,165 --> 01:01:08,760
to fold better hands.

1432
01:01:11,337 --> 01:01:12,920
I'm going to get to
the last part now.

1433
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:14,660
So quick test.

1434
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:16,720
So here what would you do?

1435
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:17,580
It's folded to you.

1436
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:18,580
You're in the high jack.

1437
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:21,770
You have ace, five of clubs.

1438
01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:24,030
So someone want to
suggest what would you do?

1439
01:01:24,030 --> 01:01:26,770
What would your play be?

1440
01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:27,530
AUDIENCE: Call.

1441
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:28,390
AUDIENCE: Bet.

1442
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:29,120
AUDIENCE: Raise.

1443
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:29,473
PROFESSOR: Raise.

1444
01:01:29,473 --> 01:01:29,826
OK, good.

1445
01:01:29,826 --> 01:01:30,326
Raise.

1446
01:01:30,326 --> 01:01:31,810
So not call.

1447
01:01:31,810 --> 01:01:33,490
That was mistake
number one to not do.

1448
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:35,615
You always want to raise
the blinds if it's folded.

1449
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:37,190
But it's fine, it's fine.

1450
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:37,690
That's fine.

1451
01:01:37,690 --> 01:01:39,940
We're all here to learn
about these hands.

1452
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:42,010
Now should I go all in
or should I just raise

1453
01:01:42,010 --> 01:01:48,880
to 450, which is 2.25?

1454
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:49,790
I should go all in.

1455
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:50,596
OK.

1456
01:01:50,596 --> 01:01:52,720
I think it's not terrible
if you just raise to 450.

1457
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:55,330
But I said if it's 10
big blinds-- there's no

1458
01:01:55,330 --> 01:01:58,330
antes so you need 10 or less.

1459
01:01:58,330 --> 01:02:00,640
And you have 10, so going
all in I think is fine.

1460
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:03,130
So we decide to go all in.

1461
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:08,900
So there are Nash calculators.

1462
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:09,790
They're complicated.

1463
01:02:09,790 --> 01:02:12,310
But if you run this through
a Nash equilibrium calculator

1464
01:02:12,310 --> 01:02:16,390
this is roughly what you
should be going all in with.

1465
01:02:16,390 --> 01:02:17,166
So we go all in.

1466
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:19,790
So this range is a bit different
than what I showed you before.

1467
01:02:19,790 --> 01:02:23,440
This is an actual Nash
calculation just not

1468
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:24,584
just my recommendation.

1469
01:02:24,584 --> 01:02:27,250
It's going to be wider than what
you saw before but that's fine.

1470
01:02:29,862 --> 01:02:30,820
So now you're this guy.

1471
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:32,290
You're seat nine.

1472
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:35,590
So I'm going to show you how you
do a quick calculation of what

1473
01:02:35,590 --> 01:02:37,050
equity you need to call here.

1474
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:43,780
So what equity you
need to call here.

1475
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:45,550
A straight up pot
odds calculation

1476
01:02:45,550 --> 01:02:50,500
says you're getting
23 to 20 or 1.15 to 1.

1477
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:54,880
So roughly you need 46.5%
equity to call as this player.

1478
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,595
But there's two players behind.

1479
01:02:56,595 --> 01:02:58,720
There is a graphics glitch
because seat one has not

1480
01:02:58,720 --> 01:02:59,219
folded.

1481
01:02:59,219 --> 01:03:01,270
Seat one and seat
two both has cards.

1482
01:03:01,270 --> 01:03:04,330
So you actually
need more than 46.5%

1483
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:07,450
equity because the
calculation of 46.5%

1484
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:10,750
assumes seat one and seat two
can't wake up with pocket aces.

1485
01:03:13,215 --> 01:03:14,590
PokerStove is very
good for this.

1486
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:15,580
And you can do this right now.

1487
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:18,121
I've taught you everything you
need to do these calculations.

1488
01:03:18,121 --> 01:03:21,455
And PokerStove is also easy
to figure out how to use.

1489
01:03:21,455 --> 01:03:22,830
You can essentially
just plug in.

1490
01:03:22,830 --> 01:03:26,070
You look at pocket
fives, it has 48%.

1491
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:28,300
You need 46.5%.

1492
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:31,390
And I said you need a bit
more than 46.5 due to the fact

1493
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:33,850
that there's two players
behind so pocket fives,

1494
01:03:33,850 --> 01:03:34,900
it's good enough.

1495
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:36,760
Well, I'll call ace nine suited.

1496
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:37,810
I'll call.

1497
01:03:37,810 --> 01:03:40,420
So I'm just showing you some
calculations on PokerStove.

1498
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:43,210
It really is a really good tool.

1499
01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:44,680
So you can do some calculations.

1500
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:51,640
So basically they call.

1501
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:53,740
And the hands I showed
you here is actually

1502
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:56,160
sort of the worse hands that
it's plus CV to call with.

1503
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:58,990
Pocket fives, ace
nines suited plus.

1504
01:03:58,990 --> 01:04:01,791
So aces nines suited plus means
ace nine suited, ace 10 suited,

1505
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:03,790
ace jack suited, all the
hands that are strictly

1506
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:05,230
better than ace nine suited.

1507
01:04:05,230 --> 01:04:07,862
Ace 10 off-suit,
king queen suited.

1508
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:14,401
As the last player here, do you
call with king queen suited?

1509
01:04:14,401 --> 01:04:15,400
It's just a rough guess.

1510
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:16,660
How many of you
intuitively would

1511
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:17,826
call with king queen suited?

1512
01:04:17,826 --> 01:04:21,600
Two players have
already gone all in.

1513
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:23,590
So most of people would fold.

1514
01:04:23,590 --> 01:04:24,910
Oh, you guys would call.

1515
01:04:24,910 --> 01:04:27,100
So it turns out,
at least according

1516
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:30,040
to the Nash calculator--

1517
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:31,714
So here you calculate
the pot odds.

1518
01:04:31,714 --> 01:04:34,380
And this is an exact calculation
because there's no more players

1519
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:34,880
behind.

1520
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:40,960
So just calculate, do
I have 29.5% accurate?

1521
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,990
Basically if I assume that
player one and player two

1522
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:47,710
are playing according to Nash
equilibrium or optimal ranges,

1523
01:04:47,710 --> 01:04:49,900
you actually have
way more than enough.

1524
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:53,230
You actually have 34%
where you only needed 25%.

1525
01:04:53,230 --> 01:04:55,470
So this is a trick
question I set up.

1526
01:04:55,470 --> 01:04:59,710
The trick was king queen suited
doesn't seem like a good hand.

1527
01:04:59,710 --> 01:05:03,160
But against two other hands it's
actually relatively a very good

1528
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:03,765
hand.

1529
01:05:03,765 --> 01:05:05,890
Against one other hand,
they could just have a pair

1530
01:05:05,890 --> 01:05:06,640
and you're behind.

1531
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:09,130
They could have an ace most
of the time and you're behind.

1532
01:05:09,130 --> 01:05:10,796
But against two other
hands you actually

1533
01:05:10,796 --> 01:05:13,300
have really good equity because
when you hit a king or queen

1534
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:14,267
you have the big pair.

1535
01:05:14,267 --> 01:05:15,850
You can also hit
straights and flushes

1536
01:05:15,850 --> 01:05:17,050
with king queens suited.

1537
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:22,300
And your equity against two
other hands is very good.

1538
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:25,420
So you have way more
than enough so they call.

1539
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:27,940
So we're going to get
in this all in freefall.

1540
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:31,826
So who are the people
I gave these cards to?

1541
01:05:31,826 --> 01:05:33,200
You guys can come
up to the front

1542
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,275
and I'm going to
hand you your cards.

1543
01:05:35,275 --> 01:05:38,220
The people who I gave these
gift certificates to, I said.

1544
01:05:48,222 --> 01:05:49,930
AUDIENCE: Do you want
me to stay up here?

1545
01:05:49,930 --> 01:05:50,380
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1546
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:50,921
Stay up here.

1547
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:56,380
So what I want you guys to do--

1548
01:05:56,380 --> 01:05:58,213
these are the hands
people went all in with.

1549
01:05:58,213 --> 01:06:00,480
Who was the first
person to answer?

1550
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:00,980
OK.

1551
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:01,880
So you get to pick.

1552
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:03,000
Which hand do you want?

1553
01:06:05,802 --> 01:06:07,537
AUDIENCE: I'll go
with jack jack.

1554
01:06:07,537 --> 01:06:08,120
PROFESSOR: OK.

1555
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:11,300
So Colin is going to jack jack.

1556
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:12,300
Sorry, what's your name?

1557
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:12,810
AUDIENCE: Kevin.

1558
01:06:12,810 --> 01:06:13,220
PROFESSOR: Kevin.

1559
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:14,090
Kevin, which hand do you want?

1560
01:06:14,090 --> 01:06:14,870
So he took jack jack.

1561
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:16,400
Which of these remaining--
you were second, right?

1562
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:17,100
Yeah, you were--

1563
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:17,340
OK.

1564
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:17,710
AUDIENCE: I was last.

1565
01:06:17,710 --> 01:06:18,230
PROFESSOR: OK.

1566
01:06:18,230 --> 01:06:19,188
Which hand do you want?

1567
01:06:21,794 --> 01:06:22,960
AUDIENCE: I want king queen.

1568
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:23,320
PROFESSOR: OK.

1569
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:24,695
So he's going to
take king queen.

1570
01:06:24,695 --> 01:06:28,310
So you're going to
take ace five plus.

1571
01:06:28,310 --> 01:06:30,795
This is sort of mean but
I want to show you guys

1572
01:06:30,795 --> 01:06:31,670
this how poker works.

1573
01:06:31,670 --> 01:06:34,697
When you've already
won, you've won $20.

1574
01:06:34,697 --> 01:06:36,280
You guys are going
to put in your hand

1575
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:39,294
and whoever wins this hand
is going to get all $60.

1576
01:06:39,294 --> 01:06:47,850
[LAUGHTER]

1577
01:06:47,850 --> 01:06:49,360
We're going to go for it.

1578
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:51,170
So this is the free
flow of equities.

1579
01:06:51,170 --> 01:06:54,854
So it is pre-determined.

1580
01:06:54,854 --> 01:06:56,520
So it looks like you
guys did very well.

1581
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:57,480
You guys picked correctly.

1582
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:58,396
You got to pick first.

1583
01:06:58,396 --> 01:07:01,720
You picked the best hand
with equity of 34.73.

1584
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:02,470
You got 32.95.

1585
01:07:02,470 --> 01:07:06,558
You're only a bit
behind with 31.1.

1586
01:07:06,558 --> 01:07:07,916
So the flop is 6, 7, 8.

1587
01:07:07,916 --> 01:07:09,540
So let's look at the
probabilities now.

1588
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:15,210
Jacks is still ahead, ace five
has picked up a lot of outs.

1589
01:07:15,210 --> 01:07:17,420
King queen of diamonds
is not looking too good

1590
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:21,080
but they did pick
up one diamond.

1591
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:23,760
Notice the nine of hearts.

1592
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,340
So, sorry.

1593
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:26,300
Like Queens.

1594
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:27,370
I'm sorry.

1595
01:07:27,370 --> 01:07:30,200
So you're out of the running.

1596
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:31,786
AUDIENCE: He needs a 10.

1597
01:07:31,786 --> 01:07:32,910
PROFESSOR: 2 to 1 to cheer.

1598
01:07:32,910 --> 01:07:34,600
Is there any card
you're hoping for?

1599
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:35,600
What are you hoping for?

1600
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:39,554
AUDIENCE: I think a 10.

1601
01:07:39,554 --> 01:07:41,855
AUDIENCE: A 10 or a heart.

1602
01:07:41,855 --> 01:07:43,480
PROFESSOR: So you
want to be screaming.

1603
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:45,313
I'm going to press it
on the count of three.

1604
01:07:45,313 --> 01:07:48,630
You want to be
screaming 10 or higher.

1605
01:07:48,630 --> 01:07:50,170
And you want to be screaming--

1606
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:51,170
AUDIENCE: Anything else.

1607
01:07:57,210 --> 01:08:00,769
PROFESSOR: So I guess
you got all three of us.

1608
01:08:00,769 --> 01:08:02,560
There's going to be
more of these good card

1609
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:03,268
stories in class.

1610
01:08:03,268 --> 01:08:05,130
So participate in
class, you're going

1611
01:08:05,130 --> 01:08:07,640
to get gift certificates

1612
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:08,240

1615
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:12,190
[APPLAUSE]
