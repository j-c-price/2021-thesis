JESSICA SOMMERVILLE:
So this morning

9
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,930
we heard Laura give a
really beautiful overview

10
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,747
of her research program,
and my talk today

11
00:00:26,747 --> 00:00:28,330
is going to be a
little bit different.

12
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:29,700
I'm going to talk
about some things that

13
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,399
are going to be
highly related to what

14
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:32,940
Laura was talking
about, particularly

15
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,320
at the end of her talk.

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,350
But because this is like brand
new hot off the press work,

17
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,860
some of it's actually ongoing as
you'll see as the talk unfolds.

18
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,650
I'm going to be focusing on a
more kind of specific detail

19
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:44,150
level.

20
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,108
So I may tell you about
four different studies,

21
00:00:46,108 --> 00:00:48,779
three of which are completed,
one of which is ongoing.

22
00:00:48,779 --> 00:00:50,820
And they all have to do
with infants' sensitivity

23
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,270
to costs and benefits.

24
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,190
OK.

25
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,332
So, as we all know,
cost benefit analyses

26
00:00:56,332 --> 00:00:57,790
are really central
to the decisions

27
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,105
we make at both a conscious
and an unconscious level.

28
00:01:00,105 --> 00:01:02,230
And, of course, there's
all kinds of different ways

29
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:03,861
that we make decisions, right?

30
00:01:03,861 --> 00:01:05,319
But one of the
things that we often

31
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,000
do when we're
making a decision is

32
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,660
we think about what rewards do
we anticipate from following

33
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,594
a particular course
of action, and how

34
00:01:12,594 --> 00:01:14,260
do those compare to
the costs that we'll

35
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,900
incur from performing
that same action.

36
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,580
And we will act
in a sense to try

37
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:22,179
to maximize the value that we
get out of a particular choice.

38
00:01:22,179 --> 00:01:24,220
That's true of simple
decisions like this, right?

39
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,553
This woman deciding what she's
going to eat for dessert.

40
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:28,180
And we can also
apply these analyses

41
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,950
to more complex
decisions, like things

42
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,449
like where we're going to go
to college, what kind of career

43
00:01:32,449 --> 00:01:34,750
are we going to pursue,
where are we going to live.

44
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:35,339
OK.

45
00:01:35,339 --> 00:01:37,630
One of the things that we
heard from Laura this morning

46
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,721
is that cost benefit
analyses don't just

47
00:01:39,721 --> 00:01:41,970
apply to her own behavior
and her own decision making.

48
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,720
She showed some
really neat evidence

49
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,150
that these types
of analyses form

50
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:48,970
the basis for the inferences
that we make about other people

51
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,010
and that we make
about their behavior.

52
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,140
So that raises the very
interesting question

53
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,605
of the developmental origins
of these types analyses.

54
00:01:55,605 --> 00:01:56,980
And that's what
I'm going to talk

55
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,355
about today,
infants' sensitivity

56
00:01:58,355 --> 00:02:00,872
to costs and benefits.

57
00:02:00,872 --> 00:02:03,080
My talk is going to kind of
have two different parts.

58
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,496
In the first part,
I'm going to be

59
00:02:04,496 --> 00:02:05,950
talking about
cases where infants

60
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,720
are observing other people.

61
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,120
And what the question
that I'm asking there is

62
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,210
do infants-- are they able to
register the costs that are

63
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,425
behind other people's actions?

64
00:02:15,425 --> 00:02:17,050
And then in the second
part of my talk,

65
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,250
I'm actually going
to switch gears,

66
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,440
and I'm going to talk
about infants' registration

67
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,579
and minimization of costs,
the registration of benefits,

68
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:25,870
to guide their own behavior,
their own decision making.

69
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,872
I'm going to talk about
a particular test case.

70
00:02:27,872 --> 00:02:30,205
And that's the test case of
infants' prosocial behavior.

71
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,180
OK.

72
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,860
And I want to be kind
of specific here.

73
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,450
So across all of
these studies, I'm

74
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,250
talking about cost in
one particular way.

75
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,750
Of course, there's
all kinds of ways

76
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,640
you could operationalize cost.

77
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,470
But what we've been
focusing on so far

78
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,540
is physical effort,
the physical effort

79
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,880
behind an action as a cost.

80
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,662
Why would we start here?

81
00:02:50,662 --> 00:02:52,620
Well, there's several
different reasons, right?

82
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,090
And the basic kind of
evolutionary level, it's

83
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,910
really important
that we can register

84
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:00,070
and that we can minimize
energetic costs,

85
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,150
effortful costs, right?

86
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,830
Our very survival
depends on that.

87
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,050
We have to metabolically
and energetically budget,

88
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,044
or we won't stick around, right?

89
00:03:07,044 --> 00:03:08,710
So that gives us good
reason that that's

90
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:11,860
a good starting place in terms
of looking at young infants'

91
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:16,390
ability to register costs and
minimize cost potentially.

92
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,240
Another reason is that
for decades, scholars

93
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,970
have really given a central role
to effort in decision-making.

94
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,490
And this dates
back to the 1940s,

95
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,170
the whole in Solomon
who postulated

96
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,580
the law of least effort.

97
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,406
So the idea here is that if
there are two lines of actions

98
00:03:30,406 --> 00:03:31,780
that lead to equal
rewards, we're

99
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,863
going to take the path of
least resistance, right?

100
00:03:33,863 --> 00:03:36,250
We're going to seek
to minimize effort.

101
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,530
And then, finally, in
more contemporary work

102
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,570
that's looked at
cost-benefit decision-making,

103
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,120
both in adults and in nonhuman
animals, a lot of this work

104
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,530
comes from the
neuroimaging literature.

105
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,125
Effort has been a fairly
heavily studied cost.

106
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,500
So this is a good
starting place,

107
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,583
because we have a pretty
good understanding of how

108
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:55,030
effort and various benefits
or reward are integrated

109
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,010
at both the neural and
a behavioral level,

110
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:01,930
at least for nonhuman
animals and for human adults.

111
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:02,740
OK.

112
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,690
So the first
question we might ask

113
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,820
is, what is the
existing evidence

114
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,710
in terms of the question
of whether infants

115
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,909
have a basic ability to
register cost behind actions.

116
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:13,450
And there's really
two different ways

117
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,620
we could pose this question.

118
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,899
We can think about the
question with respect

119
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:19,390
to infants own behavior,
their own actions.

120
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:23,260
Is there evidence that infants
will act to recognize costs

121
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,890
and to minimize costs
in their own behavior.

122
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,640
The other way that we
can ask the question

123
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,980
is in terms of infants
observation of other people's

124
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,480
behavior.

125
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,972
Do they recognize the cost
behind other people's actions.

126
00:04:34,972 --> 00:04:36,430
You know, surprisingly
there really

127
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,290
hasn't been a lot of work
that's looked directly

128
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,000
at this when we're
talking about infants

129
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,620
own behavior, their
own decision making.

130
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,970
There is some work from the
weight perception literature

131
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,660
that's looked at
how infants interact

132
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,049
with blocks of different ways.

133
00:04:48,049 --> 00:04:49,840
And so what people will
do in these studies

134
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,215
is they'll present little
babies, nine-month-old infants,

135
00:04:52,215 --> 00:04:55,030
with two blocks that
look virtually identical.

136
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,560
They only differ
from one another

137
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,665
in terms of their
respective weights.

138
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:00,040
And what these
studies have shown

139
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,260
is if you give infants a choice
between these two objects,

140
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,330
they'll systematically
prefer the light object

141
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:05,897
over the heavy object.

142
00:05:05,897 --> 00:05:08,230
So one way to think about
these findings is what infants

143
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,840
are doing here is exactly
what we're interested

144
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,850
in, they're minimizing
the physical cost, right?

145
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,756
They're taking the past of--
the path of least effort.

146
00:05:15,756 --> 00:05:17,380
One challenge, though,
for interpreting

147
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,630
these finding is oftentimes
in these studies,

148
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,130
the heavy blocks
that are being used

149
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,370
are beyond infants
lifting capacity.

150
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,870
So what that means is it's hard
to know if these results are

151
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,874
about infants
registering cost per se,

152
00:05:27,874 --> 00:05:29,290
or if what we're
really getting at

153
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:32,500
is just infants repeating a
sort of successful interaction

154
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,960
with an object that they've
acted on previously.

155
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,460
OK.

156
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,680
So Laura talked a little bit
about this in her talk today.

157
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,680
What about the evidence
of registration of costs

158
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,971
and other people's actions.

159
00:05:41,971 --> 00:05:43,720
And one of the things
that Laura mentioned

160
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,030
that we know from many,
many different studies,

161
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,370
is that infants appear
to expect efficiency

162
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,870
in other people's actions.

163
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,490
Laura showed you
one example of that.

164
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:52,760
I'll show you a
different example

165
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,510
of that, which comes
from actually a study

166
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,709
that Liz did with one of
her graduate students.

167
00:05:56,709 --> 00:05:58,250
So here we see
someone who's reaching

168
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,080
over a barrier in
order to get an object.

169
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,670
The barrier is then removed.

170
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,870
Infants have the
expectation that that person

171
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,620
is going to reach
directly for the object,

172
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,640
right, rather than performing
that funny arcing motion.

173
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,730
So, again, one way to
think about these findings

174
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,260
is that what
infants are doing is

175
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,060
they're expecting that the
person is going to take

176
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,380
the least costly action, right?

177
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,510
And, in fact, there's
all kinds of costs

178
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,430
to this particular
arcing motion, right?

179
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,950
It's indirect, it
probably takes longer,

180
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:26,396
it's probably more difficult,
it's more effortful.

181
00:06:26,396 --> 00:06:28,145
And so we wanted to
ask the question, too,

182
00:06:28,145 --> 00:06:31,550
to begin with if infants
were able to register costs.

183
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,320
But unlike in this
situation where

184
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,740
there's multiple
potentially redundant cues

185
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,630
that this arching motion
is a costly behavior,

186
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,310
we wanted to really
kind of focus

187
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,830
in on situations in
which there aren't

188
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,980
a lot of overt observable
cues to the costs underlying

189
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,980
another person's action.

190
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,680
So the way that we did
this is we showed infants

191
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,820
different actions that look
similar on their surface level,

192
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,299
but these actions
differ in terms

193
00:06:58,299 --> 00:07:00,840
of the degree of physical effort
that are required to perform

194
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,490
them, and the way
that we achieve

195
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,464
that is by having infants
watch people lift objects

196
00:07:05,464 --> 00:07:06,630
of different weights, right?

197
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:10,180
So, obviously, heavy weighted
objects are harder to lift.

198
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:14,830
They're more effortly costly
than lifting a light object.

199
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,070
And what we wanted to
know is can infants

200
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,400
recognize under conditions
where they have really minimal,

201
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,280
observable cues, no cues
about, for example, straining

202
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,810
or sweating or
things like that that

203
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,480
might be really obvious for
figuring out the effort.

204
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,109
Will they be able to understand
that when someone is lifting

205
00:07:30,109 --> 00:07:32,400
a heavy block, that's a more
effortful action than when

206
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,460
they're lifting a light block.

207
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,390
In addition to that kind
of primary question,

208
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,990
we were also interested in
whether this ability in infants

209
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,074
might be individually variable.

210
00:07:42,074 --> 00:07:43,740
So this might come
as a surprise to you,

211
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,755
but infants, like adults,
are individually variable.

212
00:07:46,755 --> 00:07:48,630
And they're individually
variable, of course,

213
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,380
in many ways.

214
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,450
But one way in which they
vary from one another

215
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,199
is in terms of how
strong they are, right?

216
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,880
Just like human adults, right?

217
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,900
We're variable in terms
of how strong we are.

218
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,240
And we have an
idea, or hypothesis,

219
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,820
that infants individual
differences in strength

220
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,029
might actually be
important for registering

221
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:07,320
the effort-related costs
behind these different lifting

222
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,502
actions with different
weighted objects.

223
00:08:09,502 --> 00:08:11,460
One of the reasons that
they might be important

224
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,580
is because of core strength
gates the type of experience

225
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,250
that infants are going to have
in their everyday life, right?

226
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,860
If you're a strong baby,
you can lift heavier objects

227
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,820
than a weak baby.

228
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,030
You can also lift a wider
contrast of range of objects,

229
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:24,750
right?

230
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,370
So we thought maybe
there's something

231
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:29,100
about individual differences
in strength, particularly,

232
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,930
for babies who are
stronger where they'll

233
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:33,960
be better at recognizing
the differential effort that

234
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,610
goes along with
lifting actions when

235
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:38,980
you're talking about
blocks of different weight.

236
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:39,480
OK.

237
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,010
So let me tell you
about the study

238
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:43,559
that we conducted to
ask this question.

239
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,570
We tested 12-month-old
infants in this study.

240
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,880
They took part in a
turn taking procedure

241
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,920
where we recorded EEG,
electrical activity

242
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,580
from the brain as it
propagates the scalp.

243
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,050
And in the course of this
task, what they did is

244
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,470
they took part in
different types of trials.

245
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,720
On observation trials, they
would watch an experimenter who

246
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,720
would lift these different
objects or these blocks,

247
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,030
and these blocks looked
perceptually identical

248
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,240
in terms of size and shape.

249
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,300
They were different colors so
infants could individuate them

250
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,090
and keep track of them, but
what varied from trial to trial

251
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,980
was exactly how much
the objects weighed.

252
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,700
So they range from being the
weight of a typical bath toy

253
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,500
to being quite heavy.

254
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,689
So infants can lift
the heaviest blocks,

255
00:09:21,689 --> 00:09:23,730
but they're pretty effortful
in order for infants

256
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,200
to be able to lift them.

257
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,810
In the trials where they watched
an experiment or interact

258
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,268
with these blocks,
the experimenter

259
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:31,740
would do things like put
the block up on a platform,

260
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:35,370
drop it into a bucket after full
type of actions where you can

261
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,920
sort of register at
least in principle

262
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,930
the type of effort
behind the action,

263
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,430
and then infants would also
have the opportunity to act.

264
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:45,340
They could perform the
same actions with objects.

265
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,250
Infants also for
measurement purpose

266
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,470
received baseline
trials where we're just

267
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:52,620
registering EEG in
response to abstract images

268
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,970
like a checkerboard
pattern, for example.

269
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:55,470
OK.

270
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,880
So what are we
interested in here?

271
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,490
So, in this particular
study, we were

272
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,740
looking at the suppression
of a particular oscillatory

273
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,110
frequency called
sensorimotor alpha,

274
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,930
or some people call
it mu attenuation.

275
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,050
So we know that at rest,
neurons in sensorimotor

276
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:14,440
cortex fire spontaneously
and they fire in synchrony.

277
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,980
And what that means is we
get these large amplitude EEG

278
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,670
oscillations in the
alpha frequency band.

279
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:23,190
When the motor cortex is
activated in remote motor

280
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,390
cortex is activated, and
that happens, of course,

281
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:25,980
when we act.

282
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,040
It also happens when we
watch other people act.

283
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,620
What you see is you see a
suppression in sensorimotor

284
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,720
alpha.

285
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,730
So many people recently
have been interested

286
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,250
in suppression of sensorimotor
alpha new attenuation

287
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,130
from the perspective of looking
at the mirror neuron system.

288
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:42,910
More broadly and
for our purposes,

289
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,670
we're really just
thinking about this

290
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:47,520
as a measure of sensorimotor
cortex activation.

291
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,580
So greater suppression equals
more sensorimotor cortex

292
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,920
activation.

293
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,250
And our question here was
whether infants activation

294
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,200
sensorimotor cortex
wouldn't vary

295
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,390
as a function of
watching people lift

296
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,560
blocks of different weights.

297
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,140
Would you get greater
activation when people

298
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,270
were lifting heavier objects?

299
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,694
Which would, of
course, be a sign

300
00:11:07,694 --> 00:11:10,110
that infants were distinguishing
between different actions

301
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,651
on the basis of effort.

302
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:13,150
OK.

303
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,820
So in addition to
looking at that,

304
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,040
we also gave infants a
group strength assessment.

305
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:18,540
OK.

306
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,220
So let me tell you a little
bit about the grip strength

307
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,594
measure, only because it took
us several years to come up

308
00:11:22,594 --> 00:11:25,800
with this so I feel like I need
to talk about it a little bit.

309
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,230
So we wanted to measure
infant strength, and the way

310
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,150
that we did that is by measuring
infants' grip strength.

311
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,410
But, of course,
the challenge here,

312
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,610
if you're an adult,
right, and you

313
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,200
want to measure an
adult's grip strength,

314
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,120
you just get something
called the dynamometer,

315
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,400
you have an adult squeeze a
bulb or squeeze the hand grip

316
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,560
and then you get this nice
force reading from that, right?

317
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,040
And that all works very smoothly
with adults but, of course, you

318
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,040
can't just hand
that to an infant

319
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,539
and say, squeeze
as hard as you can,

320
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,220
that doesn't work, obviously.

321
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,930
So what we did here is we had
an experimenter who had a toy,

322
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,580
the infant had the same toy.

323
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,340
The experimenter would squeeze
her toy, and what we hoped

324
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,710
is that this would motivate
infants, or lead infants,

325
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,420
to squeeze their toy.

326
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,540
Their toy, in contrast to
the experimenter's toy,

327
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:05,830
had both a hidden sensor
embedded within the toy, which

328
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:08,080
led to playing Old
McDonald, which, of course,

329
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,530
infants greatly like, right?

330
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,200
They find that very enjoyable.

331
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,420
And it also had a hidden
pressure sensor within it.

332
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,720
So we were able to
get-- or to measure how

333
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,584
hard infants squeezed the toy.

334
00:12:18,584 --> 00:12:20,500
Now, the trick here was
we want to get infants

335
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,541
strongest squeeze, right?

336
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,440
So what we did is we
set up our device so

337
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,690
that each time the
infant squeezes it,

338
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:28,300
they have to squeeze harder
to get Old McDonald to play.

339
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,670
And, of course, they want
Old McDonald to play, right?

340
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,630
So they're motivated
to keep doing that.

341
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,930
So that's how we record
infants' maximum grip strength.

342
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:37,420
We like essentially keep
going as long as infants will

343
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,656
allow us to do that, basically.

344
00:12:39,656 --> 00:12:41,530
There are some other
things that we measured.

345
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,030
We measured infants weight.

346
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,946
Our motivation for doing this
is that an adults' strength

347
00:12:45,946 --> 00:12:47,320
and weight are
highly correlated.

348
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,695
They were in our sample so
that kind of helps to validate

349
00:12:49,695 --> 00:12:51,130
or grip strength paradigm.

350
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:53,860
And there were things like
general motor maturity that we

351
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,170
measured, gross motor skills.

352
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,324
We measured how frequently
infants lift blocks

353
00:12:58,324 --> 00:13:00,490
within the task, because
we want a control for these

354
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:01,210
in our analyses.

355
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:02,626
We're wanting to
look specifically

356
00:13:02,626 --> 00:13:04,910
at the effective grip strength.

357
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,140
OK.

358
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:06,640
OK.

359
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,127
So let me tell you a bit-- the
first thing that we looked at.

360
00:13:10,127 --> 00:13:12,210
So I'm going to show you
a series of scatter plots

361
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:14,830
that look at the relation
between sensorimotor alpha

362
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,620
suppression, and
infant's grip strength.

363
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,750
And these are
plotted as a function

364
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,460
of the weight of the block.

365
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,847
And these are when infants
are observing other people.

366
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:27,180
So the thing to know is we're
talking about suppression,

367
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,763
so you're looking
for negative scores.

368
00:13:28,763 --> 00:13:31,450
More negative scores
mean more suppression.

369
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,130
And we had a
particular hypothesis

370
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,920
about how this would go, or
idea about how this would go.

371
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,070
We thought that when the
blocks were relatively light,

372
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:41,630
grip strength would be
less of a good predictor

373
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,600
of sensorimotor
alpha suppression.

374
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,310
And the reason for
thinking that is

375
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:48,100
that whether an infant is
relatively strong or relatively

376
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,770
weak, they all probably have
lifetime experience lifting

377
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,700
relatively light objects.

378
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,800
However, where strength
really comes into play

379
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,160
is as objects get
heavier, right?

380
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,410
So stronger infants,
very likely,

381
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:03,640
have a greater lifetime history
of lifting heavier objects.

382
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,470
So our prediction was
that these two things

383
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:09,100
would be increasingly tightly
integrated as block weight goes

384
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,130
up.

385
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,460
And, in fact, that's
exactly what we found.

386
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:15,340
So there's weak relations
when the block is light,

387
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,110
when it's that heavy block--

388
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,420
we call them the heavy and
the super heavy block--

389
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,590
there's a tighter relation.

390
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,750
And you see the
strongest relation here

391
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,510
when the block is
extremely heavy.

392
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:28,030
And these analyses
control for things

393
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,610
like infants in task lifting
experience, their weight,

394
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,842
their motor development scores.

395
00:14:32,842 --> 00:14:34,300
So the next thing
we wanted to know

396
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,716
is we wanted to
know whether there

397
00:14:35,716 --> 00:14:38,110
was any evidence that
suppression of sensorimotor

398
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:43,060
alpha would be greater in cases
in which the block is heaviest

399
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,710
versus the block is lightest.

400
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,965
So this is really our
index, or our measure,

401
00:14:46,965 --> 00:14:49,090
of whether infants are
differentiating when they're

402
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:52,000
watching other people act
on objects, whether they're

403
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,150
differentiating the degree
of effort that goes along

404
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,580
with lifting the object as
a function of block weight.

405
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,538
So what I'm going to show
you is change scores.

406
00:14:59,538 --> 00:15:01,300
So more negative
means that you're

407
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,200
seeing increasing sensorimotor
alpha suppression for heavy

408
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,700
versus light blocks,
and these are

409
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,449
plotted as a function of
infants' grip strength.

410
00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:11,740
So what you can see here is
that for the weaker babies,

411
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,781
the lower grip strength
babies, you're not really

412
00:15:13,781 --> 00:15:16,060
seeing any systematic
change from the latest

413
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,475
block to the heaviest block.

414
00:15:17,475 --> 00:15:19,840
But you are for the
stronger infants.

415
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,510
So what these findings suggest
to us is that the stronger

416
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,912
infants appear to be
differentiating these actions

417
00:15:24,912 --> 00:15:27,370
on the basis of the weight of
the object that the person is

418
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:30,950
lifting, the weaker
infants aren't.

419
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:31,450
OK.

420
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:33,489
So what do we know
from this data.

421
00:15:33,489 --> 00:15:35,280
Well, we have some
evidence that activation

422
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,750
of sensorimotor cortex
as indexed by suppression

423
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,330
of sensorimotor alpha,
while babies are watching

424
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:42,306
other people lift blocks
of different weights,

425
00:15:42,306 --> 00:15:44,680
varies as the function of the
weight of the block, right?

426
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,360
So this might
signal that infants

427
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,330
are able to recognize that
different actions have

428
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:53,860
different degrees of physical
effort that go along with them.

429
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,440
And we also see that the
ability to make this distinction

430
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,800
is tied to infants own strength,
their own grip strength.

431
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,450
And our interpretation
of this is

432
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:04,420
that this might have to
do with strength being

433
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,310
a rate limiter,
or a facilitator,

434
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,890
or the type of experience
that infants previously

435
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:11,454
have with objects of
different weights.

436
00:16:11,454 --> 00:16:13,120
And, in particular,
the stronger infants

437
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,580
might have more experience
with lifting heavier objects.

438
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:18,040
They might have more
contrastive experience, which

439
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,494
allows them to better recognize,
or better differentiate,

440
00:16:20,494 --> 00:16:21,910
the degree of
physical effort that

441
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,680
go along with
different actions when

442
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,540
you're talking about lifting
objects of different weight.

443
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,450
OK.

444
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,130
So that's part one.

445
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:32,980
So I think what these data tell
us is that in this context,

446
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,660
infants have a
means of registering

447
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,680
effort related costs.

448
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,290
I think where they go above
past data is that they tell us

449
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:41,410
that infants can do this
under conditions in which they

450
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:42,720
have minimal behavioral cues.

451
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,720
So we think back to that
reaching action, right?

452
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,550
There's all kinds of cues that
this is a costly action, right?

453
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:51,230
There's all kinds of ways that
it differs from a direct reach.

454
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:54,020
In this situation, we're
talking about actions

455
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:57,230
that are really minimally
different from one another.

456
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,570
What I want to do now is I
want to switch gears and talk

457
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,850
about kind of the
flip side of the coin.

458
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,099
And that is infants use
of costs and benefits,

459
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:05,780
or reward, to guide
their own behavior.

460
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,550
And I'm going to be
specifically focusing

461
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:11,919
on the test case of
infants prosocial behavior.

462
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,460
So many of you may
know this already,

463
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,560
but infants are highly
prosocial, right?

464
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,528
There's been a lot of
studies on this recently,

465
00:17:17,528 --> 00:17:19,069
and all of these
studies have kind of

466
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:20,780
come down on the
conclusion that starting

467
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,238
in the second year
of life, infants

468
00:17:22,238 --> 00:17:24,920
will do things like help
people achieve their goals,

469
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,099
they will share toys or
objects with other people,

470
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:29,960
they're comfort
people in distress.

471
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,820
But there are
questions and debates

472
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,370
that are hotly contested about
early prosocial development,

473
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:38,760
and I just want to bring two
of them to your attention.

474
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,650
OK.

475
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:42,560
So one question is, when
does infants or children's

476
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,880
prosocial behavior become
selective or strategic, right?

477
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,710
So we know that
by preschool age,

478
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,110
early school age, children's
prosocial behavior

479
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,841
is somewhat selective,
meaning that there

480
00:17:52,841 --> 00:17:54,590
are some people, for
example, that infants

481
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:57,190
are more likely to help
than others, right?

482
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,990
And children are-- not
infants, children-- children

483
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:02,570
are more likely to
help under situations

484
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:06,080
where they are perhaps
reputational concerns involved.

485
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,510
But what we don't yet
know is whether this

486
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,922
is true of very early
prosocial development.

487
00:18:10,922 --> 00:18:12,630
So what is the
developmental course like?

488
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:15,710
Do kids start off being
selective and strategic?

489
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:18,080
Or do they only get there
over time with development?

490
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,539
That's one question.

491
00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:21,080
There's another
related question that

492
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,420
has to do with what is
the underlying motivation

493
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,000
for prosocial behavior, right?

494
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,890
So the kind of
generous interpretation

495
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:31,640
of infants prosocial is actions,
children's prosocial action,

496
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,086
is what is going on here
is infants are motivated

497
00:18:34,086 --> 00:18:35,210
by empathic concern, right?

498
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,751
They care about
other people's needs,

499
00:18:36,751 --> 00:18:38,690
they care about other
people's desires.

500
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,250
And in these
experimental context,

501
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,830
what they're doing is they're
acting to meet another person's

502
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,260
needs, they're acting
out of empathic concern.

503
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,780
But there's also other reasons
why infants, or anyone,

504
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,750
for that matter, might
behave prosocially,

505
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,520
that might have to do
with social affiliation

506
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,880
biases, social motivation,
that might have

507
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,400
to do with wanting to see
a goal being completed,

508
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,490
et cetera, right?

509
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:03,680
So one of the ways that we
can start to get traction

510
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,070
on these issues is by looking
at the impact of various costs

511
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,390
on infants' prosocial behavior.

512
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:11,060
And somewhat surprisingly, this
is not a terribly well studied

513
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,870
topic as of yet.

514
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:15,089
So there are some studies
that are both with infants

515
00:19:15,089 --> 00:19:16,880
and with children,
where people have looked

516
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,250
at the impact of personal
cost on prosocial behavior

517
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,670
and, usually, the way personal
costs are operationalized

518
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,599
is in terms of,
let's say, an infant

519
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:27,140
is tested in a paradigm where
they need to help someone else,

520
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,869
or share an object
with someone else.

521
00:19:28,869 --> 00:19:30,410
And they might be
required to give up

522
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:33,000
their own object versus an
object that's just sitting

523
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
there in the lab, right?

524
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,900
Presumably, their own object
has higher personal cost.

525
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,300
Now, we don't really know
when personal costs start

526
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,920
to impact infants'
prosocial behavior,

527
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,900
because there's been a
lot of mixed evidence.

528
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,270
And, particularly, in
infancy, there's, as of yet,

529
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:50,490
no systematic evidence that high
personal costs actually reduce

530
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:53,174
infants' prosocial responding.

531
00:19:53,174 --> 00:19:55,340
What about the question of
energetic physical effort

532
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,510
related costs?

533
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,890
Well, again, here, this is
really an understudy topic.

534
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,350
So there's one
existing study that

535
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:02,030
has looked at infants
helping under kind

536
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:05,279
of minimal physical effort cost.

537
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:07,820
And it's a little bit hard to
know what to make of that study

538
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,740
because we know that
infants helping behavior

539
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,679
is still present under
those conditions,

540
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,970
we just don't really know
how it compares to conditions

541
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:15,770
where the physical
costs are low.

542
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:18,560
OK.

543
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,410
So we started off by asking a
really super simple question

544
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:23,180
about infants
prosocial behavior,

545
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,480
and that was whether the
anticipated physical effort

546
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,850
that goes along with
prosocial responding

547
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:31,160
influences infants
prosocial responding.

548
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,710
In particular, when the effort
is high, does it increase,

549
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:36,070
or rather, decrease
infants prosociality.

550
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:39,210
OK.

551
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:42,396
So we tested 18-month-old
infants in this study.

552
00:20:42,396 --> 00:20:44,520
Start by telling you about
the critical test phase,

553
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,900
it was a helping task.

554
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,307
An experimenter was on the
opposite side of the room.

555
00:20:48,307 --> 00:20:49,890
She needs a block
in order to complete

556
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:52,140
a tower that she's building.

557
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,981
What happens before
that is all infants

558
00:20:53,981 --> 00:20:55,230
take part in a training phase.

559
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,813
They're faced with
these vinyl blocks.

560
00:20:56,813 --> 00:20:58,560
You'll see a video
clip in a moment.

561
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,000
And these vinyl clocks have--

562
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,072
blocks have been rigged by us
so that they range in weight.

563
00:21:03,072 --> 00:21:05,030
There's five of them,
they're different colors,

564
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,569
so infants can
keep track of them.

565
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:08,610
During training, what
happens is the experimenter

566
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:10,320
plays a game with
an infant where

567
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,860
they get them to drop
each block into a bucket.

568
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,590
Babies like to do that, it
makes a cool noise, right?

569
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:19,090
And, really, this training
phase serves two purposes.

570
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:20,580
The first purpose
that it serves is

571
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,460
we want infants to learn
how much each block weighs.

572
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,960
The second purpose
that it serves

573
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,000
is we want to be
able to record what

574
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
is the heaviest block that
infants are capable of lifting.

575
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,350
All right.

576
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,850
In the test phase,
as I told you,

577
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:34,680
the experimenter's on the
opposite side of the room,

578
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,120
she's building a
block tower, she

579
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,072
needs a block to complete it.

580
00:21:38,072 --> 00:21:40,530
There's a single target block
available to infants and what

581
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,510
varies between
our two conditions

582
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,920
is the weight of that block.

583
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,590
So for half of the babies, the
lightest block of the training

584
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,169
blocks is left behind.

585
00:21:48,169 --> 00:21:49,710
And for the other
half of the babies,

586
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,080
the heaviest block that
infants are capable of lifting

587
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,400
has been left behind.

588
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,226
So we're contrasting
effort here in terms

589
00:21:55,226 --> 00:21:56,850
of the weight of the
block that infants

590
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:01,960
have to carry across the room
to help the experimenter.

591
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,050
So we're looking at
infants block retrievals.

592
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:06,570
The other thing that we
recorded was a parent report

593
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:07,900
of infants walking experience.

594
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,800
So these are 18-month-old
infants, they can all walk.

595
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,990
On average, they've been
walking for six months

596
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:14,970
so they're all
experienced walkers.

597
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,470
But there's
individual variability

598
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:19,290
in terms of how long
they've been walking for.

599
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:20,470
So why was this important?

600
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,750
Well, here was our
underlying logic.

601
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,833
Imagine that you and a
friend are going on a hike,

602
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:26,550
you're both equally strong,
you can both lift 60 pounds.

603
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,260
But your friend
is an expert hiker

604
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,972
and you're a novice
hiker, right?

605
00:22:29,972 --> 00:22:32,430
And you both have to carry a
60 pound backpack up the hill.

606
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:35,244
Well, despite the fact that you
might both be equally strong,

607
00:22:35,244 --> 00:22:36,660
if you're the
novice hiker, that's

608
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,451
probably going to be
more effortful for you

609
00:22:38,451 --> 00:22:40,830
to get that backpack up the
hill than it is going to be

610
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,850
for your friend or your buddy.

611
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,700
So we had a
particular prediction

612
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:48,060
that what we would see is a
relationship between parent

613
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:51,120
reporter walking experience,
and infants likelihood do this--

614
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,160
likelihood to help the
experimenter by carrying

615
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,040
the block across the room, and
that this would be selective,

616
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:00,780
or at least stronger, for
the high effort condition.

617
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,070
OK.

618
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:04,140
So let me show you a
couple little video clips

619
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:07,064
here so you can get a
flavor of the procedure.

620
00:23:07,064 --> 00:23:08,730
This is just showing
you the test phase,

621
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,919
so it's exerted
from the test phase.

622
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:12,960
There's one thing I want
to explain a little bit.

623
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,765
So you can see up here there's
this striped bucket here.

624
00:23:17,765 --> 00:23:19,140
And the reason
that we have there

625
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,514
is-- that there is because we
want the experimenter to be

626
00:23:21,514 --> 00:23:23,670
unaware of the target
block that is left behind,

627
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:25,860
so they're naive to
the infant's condition.

628
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,780
It looks like from the infants'
perspective that they can see

629
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,180
the target block, but
they actually can't.

630
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,420
They don't know if they're
in the high or low effort

631
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,260
condition.

632
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,440
So this is the baby who is
tested in the low effort

633
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,952
condition.

634
00:23:36,952 --> 00:23:37,618

I'm going to use these
blocks to make a tower.

This one can go here.

638
00:23:47,976 --> 00:23:50,560
And this block can go--

oh, no.

640
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:58,010
Oh, no, I'm missing the block
I need to finish my tower.

641
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:59,994
I'm missing my block.

Ah, oh, there it
is, Joelle look.

00:24:02,994 --> 00:24:06,140
The block got moved
on your blanket.

Can you bring me the blocks

[END PLAYBACK]

646
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:15,459
All right.

647
00:24:15,459 --> 00:24:17,000
Sorry, we exerted
a little bit early.

648
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,666
He goes over and he
gives her the block.

649
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:19,410
OK.

650
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:19,910
OK.

651
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:21,890
Now let's watch a baby in
the high effort condition.

652
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:23,840
Remember, the only difference
between these two conditions

653
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,210
is the weight of the block
that's been left behind.

654
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:27,412
OK.

This one can go here.

There it is, Rose.

665
00:24:51,764 --> 00:24:54,360
The block got left
on your blanket.

666
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,140
Can you bring me the block
so I can finish my tower?

671
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,430
So it's a little hard to
hear what she was saying,

672
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,700
but if you couldn't hear it,
she was saying, no, thank you.

673
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,240
So she said, no.

674
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:29,770
No, thank you.

00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:30,353
No, thank you.

676
00:25:30,353 --> 00:25:31,760
OK.

677
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,470
So that's a-- pretty
illustrative of the procedure.

678
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:34,970
OK.

679
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:35,890
So what did we find?

680
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:38,161
So here's infants' rates of
helping in the low effort

681
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:38,660
condition.

682
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,880
In the high effort
condition what you can see.

683
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,440
So infants help
much more frequently

684
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,055
in the low effort condition
than in a high effort condition.

685
00:25:45,055 --> 00:25:46,430
Here's what we
found with respect

686
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,900
to infants' walking experience.

687
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,930
A walking experience, how long
an infant has been walking

688
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:53,390
predicts infants' likelihood
of helping in the high effort

689
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:54,470
condition.

690
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:57,115
And what this tells us
is that for each month

691
00:25:57,115 --> 00:25:58,490
of additional
walking experience,

692
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,950
infants are twice
as likely to help.

693
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:03,170
Now, what we can see
here is that infants

694
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:05,690
are less likely to help under
high effort conditions, right?

695
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,910
So infants prosocial
behavior is influenced

696
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:11,100
by the effort related costs
of prosocial responding.

697
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,430
And a critic, I
guess, could say,

698
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:16,820
well, maybe it's that--
it's not that infants

699
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,920
are going by the
effort, it's maybe

700
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,600
that they're not able to help
in the high effort condition.

701
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,990
We don't think that that's
the case, because infants have

702
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:26,960
given us evidence that they're
capable of lifting that block,

703
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,480
right?

704
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,854
That they're later-- later
tested with in the high effort

705
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:30,395
condition.

706
00:26:30,395 --> 00:26:31,895
But the next condition
I'll show you

707
00:26:31,895 --> 00:26:35,250
will also kind of speak to that.

708
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:37,550
And the important--
another important thing

709
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:40,150
to recognize here
is that infants

710
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:43,280
seem to be recognizing these
costs at an objective level.

711
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,500
I think Laura called
this in her talk an agent

712
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,700
independent level, right?

713
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,280
As a function of the
circumstances of the situation,

714
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,240
right?

715
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,520
And they're also
recognizing costs

716
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,200
that at a more
subjective level in terms

717
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,000
of their own
capabilities and how that

718
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,440
influences the particular cost.

719
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,690
In this case, it's their
amount of walking experience,

720
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:02,450
how expert a walker they are.

721
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:04,850
OK.

722
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:07,040
So what we wanted to
do next is to find out

723
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,230
whether if when
infants are presented

724
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:11,277
with these high effortful
helping situations,

725
00:27:11,277 --> 00:27:12,860
whether infants
helping behavior would

726
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:16,160
vary as a function of
the motivational benefits

727
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,900
of prosocial responding.

728
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,930
Now, it's been pretty
firmly established

729
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,180
that early prosocial
responding appears to be

730
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,750
immune to extrinsic rewards.

731
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,270
So what that means
is if you test

732
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,936
a baby in one of these
helping paradigms

733
00:27:27,936 --> 00:27:29,889
and you say, good job,
way to go, good job.

734
00:27:29,889 --> 00:27:31,430
That's actually not
going to increase

735
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:32,846
their subsequent
helping behavior.

736
00:27:32,846 --> 00:27:35,701
If anything, it
will decrease it.

737
00:27:35,701 --> 00:27:38,360
But that doesn't mean that
more intrinsic rewards

738
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,860
don't influence
how infants perform

739
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:40,943
on these particular tasks.

740
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:46,820
We know from some prior work
that infants by this age

741
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:49,250
have certain affiliated
biases, right?

742
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,200
They have biases
for individuals who

743
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,300
share their preferences,
who share the--

744
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,290
who like the same things
that the infant likes.

745
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:57,140
They prefer to play
with those people who--

746
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,690
than people who don't like
the same thing that they like.

747
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:03,110
And they also have-- possess
affiliated biases for people

748
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:03,860
who could be--

749
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:06,716
said to share sort of in-group
member characteristics, right?

750
00:28:06,716 --> 00:28:08,090
So infants, like
people who speak

751
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:09,464
in native-- their
native language

752
00:28:09,464 --> 00:28:12,200
over a nonnative
language speaker.

753
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,970
And, of course, these
affiliated biases

754
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:16,250
might have important
functional consequences, right?

755
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:19,070
They might be important
for cultural learning.

756
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,380
So what we wanted to
know in this next study

757
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,800
is whether we could kind of push
around these intrinsic benefits

758
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,870
for infants to see if
their behavior would

759
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:33,599
change under these high
effort helping conditions.

760
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:35,640
The way that we did this
in this particular study

761
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:40,530
is prior to the test
procedure, the helping task,

762
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:42,750
we had infants take
part in this little task

763
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,070
where they were given one--

764
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:44,580
two toys.

765
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,840
They could choose
between the two toys.

766
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,190
This happened on three
different trials,

767
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,394
different toys each trial.

768
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:49,560
Infants would make a choice.

769
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:53,010
And then the experimenter
would subsequently

770
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:56,010
show that she liked one toy
and disliked the other toy.

771
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:57,720
And the really
simple manipulation

772
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,310
between these two
different conditions

773
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:02,400
was whether the experimenter
liked the same toy as the baby,

774
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,050
or whether she
liked the other toy.

775
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:06,420
So did she share the
infant's preferences,

776
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,706
or did she oppose their
preferences, right?

777
00:29:08,706 --> 00:29:10,330
And we would think
in terms of the data

778
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:11,910
on infants affiliative
biases, that they

779
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:13,451
would prefer to
interact with someone

780
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:16,320
who shares their preferences.

781
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,570
Infants took part in
the same helping task

782
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:20,340
as they did in the
first experiment.

783
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:23,160
To streamline the procedure,
we used the medium block weight

784
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,174
that infants have been capable
of lifting in the first study.

785
00:29:26,174 --> 00:29:28,590
The other thing that we did
is we added a post-test phase.

786
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:31,380
So we excluded any
infants who were not

787
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:34,350
capable in the post-test
of lifting the target block

788
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,490
or a heavier block, right?

789
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:38,370
So we know for all of
these infants in the sample

790
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:39,690
that they can lift the block.

791
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:43,084
The question is, do they
help the experimenter.

792
00:29:46,491 --> 00:29:46,990
OK.

793
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:48,760
So we again looked at
infants' helping behavior,

794
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,540
we looked at their
walking experience.

795
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,850
The other thing that
we did in the study

796
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:54,280
is we looked at infants helping
as a function of the response

797
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:54,780
period.

798
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,435
Whether helping
occurred in the--

799
00:29:56,435 --> 00:29:58,810
rates of helping in the first
half of the response period

800
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:01,630
versus the rates of helping
overall in the response period.

801
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:03,220
And our motivation
for doing this

802
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,320
is that we thought that
if there are differences

803
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,819
in the degree of
motivation to help,

804
00:30:06,819 --> 00:30:09,700
you might see early differences
in the response period, right?

805
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,620
So early on, infants
might differentiate

806
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,100
across the conditions.

807
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,410
But these might
attenuate over time.

808
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:17,560
One thing I forgot to
mention is that in the course

809
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,540
of the response
period, infants receive

810
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:23,260
prompts at certain
intervals in order to say,

811
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,910
can you get me the block, right?

812
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:26,590
So the question is
with these prompts

813
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:30,840
will any early differences that
we see attenuate over time?

814
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,377
OK.

815
00:30:31,377 --> 00:30:32,460
So here's what we can see.

816
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,850
This is the first half
of the response period.

817
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,600
Infants in the shared
preference condition

818
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,530
are significantly more likely
to help the experimenter

819
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:41,350
than infants in the nonshared
preference condition, right?

820
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:43,690
So when there are intrinsic
rewards associated

821
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:45,310
with engaging in
high effort behavior,

822
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,670
infants are more likely
to help the experimenter.

823
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:49,450
And the other thing
that we saw is

824
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:51,970
that infants walking
experience significantly

825
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:55,870
predicts helping behavior in the
nonshared preference condition.

826
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:58,630
So when the motivational
benefits are low,

827
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:01,990
these subjective costs
seem to exert a stronger--

828
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:04,980
a stronger role, have a
stronger predictive value,

829
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,819
than when the motivational
consequences-- or, sorry,

830
00:31:07,819 --> 00:31:09,110
motivational benefits are high.

831
00:31:11,521 --> 00:31:14,020
And then here, this just shows
you infants' helping behavior

832
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,180
but, now, as a function of
the overall response period.

833
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,180
You can see they're still
numerically different,

834
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,870
but they start to
come together, right?

835
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:21,520
So the differences
are really driven

836
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,860
by what's happening early
in the response period.

837
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,087
OK.

838
00:31:28,087 --> 00:31:30,170
So these findings suggest
that infants willingness

839
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:31,730
to engage in high effort--

840
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:33,680
high cost helping is
motivated or affected

841
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,867
by intrinsic
motivational factors.

842
00:31:35,867 --> 00:31:38,450
Infants are more likely to carry
a heavy block to help someone

843
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:39,740
who shares their preference.

844
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,156
One thing I want
to point out here

845
00:31:41,156 --> 00:31:43,426
is that these findings
help us sort of

846
00:31:43,426 --> 00:31:45,800
interpret what's going on in
the first experiment, right?

847
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,140
If the first experiment
was explained by the fact

848
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,656
that it's a lack of ability
versus a lack of effort,

849
00:31:50,656 --> 00:31:52,280
we shouldn't get
these findings, right?

850
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,620
Because the effort is equivalent
across these two conditions

851
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,119
here.

852
00:31:55,119 --> 00:32:00,625
And what simply varies are the
kind of motivational benefits.

853
00:32:00,625 --> 00:32:01,432
OK.

854
00:32:01,432 --> 00:32:03,140
So, now, I want to
tell you about a study

855
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,885
that we're just in the
middle of conducting.

856
00:32:05,885 --> 00:32:07,760
I think it's really
exciting and interesting.

857
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,820
I'd be curious to
get your thoughts.

858
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,760
So we're literally
mid data collection,

859
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,590
but I think I have
enough data to tell you

860
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:15,110
what's going on so far.

861
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:17,630
So, now, we're trying to
expand the scope of benefits

862
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:19,400
that we're looking at, right?

863
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,720
And as we sort of
alluded to earlier,

864
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,530
we don't-- really
don't know as of yet,

865
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:25,940
or we don't know very much,
about what cost counts

866
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,970
as a cost and a benefit
for infants, right?

867
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:29,345
That's something
that we actually

868
00:32:29,345 --> 00:32:31,509
have to figure out to
determine empirically.

869
00:32:31,509 --> 00:32:33,050
There's been some
recent studies that

870
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:35,510
have shown that three- and
four-year-olds, perhaps

871
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:38,540
paradoxically, when they're
tested in sharing tasks,

872
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,450
are more likely to share
with a rich recipient

873
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:43,460
than a poor recipient, right?

874
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,740
And that is paradoxical in
the sense that, of course,

875
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:49,160
the rich recipient has less of
a need than the poor recipient.

876
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,550
But, perhaps,
unsurprising in the sense

877
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:54,470
that there's something
self-serving, right,

878
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,810
like it might be in your
self-interest to affiliate

879
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:59,018
with people who have a lot
of resources versus people

880
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,230
who have few resources.

881
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:03,080
In our study, what we did, is
before infants got the helping

882
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,660
task, we demonstrated to
them that one individual

883
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,420
had more resources than
the other individual.

884
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,890
It's a really
simple manipulation.

885
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:11,690
What they did is they
saw two individuals are

886
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:12,481
sitting at a table.

887
00:33:12,481 --> 00:33:14,810
They both had these like
transparent fish bowl looking

888
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:18,110
balls, and on each trial
they have different goods

889
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,520
in the fish bowls.

890
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:23,030
So what happens is that
one individual always

891
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:24,297
has lots of stuff, right?

892
00:33:24,297 --> 00:33:26,380
On one trial it's animal
crackers, the other trial

893
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,650
it's these cool little balls.

894
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:31,280
The third trial it's these cool,
flashing little blingy rings.

895
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,800
And the other
person has very few.

896
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,930
But they both do
exactly the same thing

897
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:36,980
during this first phase.

898
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,530
What they do is
they take turns--

899
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:40,280
we counterbalance
everything, of course--

900
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,260
they pull out three
objects one at a time

901
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:46,700
and, they say, hey, baby,
look at all my toys, right?

902
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,390
So they're both doing the same
thing, exactly the same thing.

903
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:53,690
What differs is the kind of
resource contacts, right?

904
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:55,050
One of them has a lot of stuff.

905
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:57,240
One of them only has
three things, right?

906
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,670
And we do that on
repeated trials,

907
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,000
because we're trying
to give babies

908
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,240
the impression that,
generally, this person has more

909
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,945
stuff than the other person.

910
00:34:03,945 --> 00:34:05,300
OK.

911
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,197
So then we test infants
in the helping task.

912
00:34:07,197 --> 00:34:09,530
This helping task is a little
bit different than the one

913
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:11,196
I just told you about,
because now we're

914
00:34:11,196 --> 00:34:13,500
pitting these two experimenters
against one another.

915
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,280
The experimenters in the helping
task have equivalent need.

916
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,409
They both, like Miranda
was doing earlier,

917
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:19,701
are building this tower, right?

918
00:34:19,701 --> 00:34:21,450
They're missing a
block, they need a block

919
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:22,850
to complete their tower, right?

920
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:24,020
The only thing
that differentiates

921
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,730
the experimenters is
what happened previously.

922
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,688
One person had a lot of
stuff, the other person

923
00:34:27,688 --> 00:34:29,840
didn't have very much stuff.

924
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,239
And the other thing that
we're manipulating here

925
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:35,420
is whether the
infant has to engage

926
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:39,830
in equally effortful actions
to help the two experimenters,

927
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:42,560
or whether helping one
of the experimenters

928
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,000
is more effortful.

929
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,920
And the way that we've
operationalized this so

930
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:50,960
far in this study is by varying
how long the baby has to walk.

931
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,600
So, in one case, the person
is within a few feet,

932
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,440
in the other case,
they're across the room.

933
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,560
OK.

934
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,990
So let me show you the data,
first, for the equal effort

935
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:00,580
condition.

936
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,660
So these are-- this is--

937
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:06,410
what this graph shows you
is who the baby is helping.

938
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:09,950
And what you can see here is
when effort is equivalent,

939
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:12,290
infants are systematically
helping the person

940
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:13,490
who has more resources.

941
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:16,346
They're helping the rich
experimenter, right?

942
00:35:16,346 --> 00:35:17,720
So now the question
becomes, what

943
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,504
happens in cases
of unequal effort?

944
00:35:19,504 --> 00:35:21,170
And as I said, this
data is still coming

945
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:23,086
and we're still testing
this, so the condition

946
00:35:23,086 --> 00:35:26,150
that we started with, given that
we have this initial pattern,

947
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:28,760
is the condition where the rich
experimenter is the one you

948
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,021
have to walk a long way to.

949
00:35:30,021 --> 00:35:31,520
And the poor
experimenter is the one

950
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,432
you have to walk a short way to.

951
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:35,390
And here's what we see.

952
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:37,680
It flips.

953
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,080
So I think what this suggests is
that infants are both weighing

954
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:45,080
the costs of the action
they have to perform,

955
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:48,770
and the intrinsic motivational
benefits as defined

956
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:50,240
by these sort of
things that might

957
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,370
be important for
social affiliation.

958
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:55,550
OK.

959
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,008
So what implications
does this have

960
00:35:57,008 --> 00:35:59,182
for infants' prosocial behavior?

961
00:35:59,182 --> 00:36:00,890
Well, it suggests that
it may be the case

962
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:02,750
that cost benefit
analyses underlie

963
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,070
infants prosocial behavior.

964
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:06,890
In particular, their
helping behavior.

965
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:09,304
And I also want to take us
back to two of the questions

966
00:36:09,304 --> 00:36:10,220
that I raised earlier.

967
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,680
One was about the
selective nature

968
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,830
of early prosocial behavior,
the strategic nature.

969
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:19,160
And the other was about
the underlying motivation.

970
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:22,020
So think in terms of the
selective strategic question,

971
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:25,400
on the one hand, we can say,
fairly early on at 18 months,

972
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,340
infants' prosocial behavior
is strategic in the sense

973
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,350
that what they
seem to be doing is

974
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:33,330
minimizing costs and maximizing
motivational benefits.

975
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:38,300
And in terms of
the motivation, I

976
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,860
think what these
findings tell us,

977
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:42,170
and this is not to say that
infants are never motivated

978
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:43,586
by empathic concern,
they're never

979
00:36:43,586 --> 00:36:45,270
motivated by other
people's needs,

980
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:47,620
but there are other things
that come into play here.

981
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:50,120
So infants' underlying
motivation to help

982
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,910
is influenced by a tendency
to want to affiliate

983
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:56,750
with particular individuals.

984
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:57,377
OK.

985
00:36:57,377 --> 00:36:59,960
So I told you a little bit about
infants registration of costs

986
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,757
in the actions of other people,
their use of costs and benefits

987
00:37:02,757 --> 00:37:04,340
to guide their own
prosocial behavior.

988
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:08,030
I just want to close by kind of
raising some questions that I

989
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:11,010
think we should be interested
in pursuing in the future.

990
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:11,510
OK.

991
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:12,920
So this came up earlier, right?

992
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,545
So one thing that we
have to understand

993
00:37:14,545 --> 00:37:16,040
to understand
infants' behavior is

994
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,200
to understand what acts
as a cost for infants

995
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,984
and what acts as a
benefit for infants.

996
00:37:19,984 --> 00:37:22,400
And I think the thing that's
really important to point out

997
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,000
here is it won't necessarily be
what we think as adults, right?

998
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,322
It won't be intuitive
to us, right?

999
00:37:28,322 --> 00:37:29,780
And the classic
example that we can

1000
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,720
think about is, you know,
you buy your child this toy,

1001
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,280
you bring it home
from the store,

1002
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,830
you're so excited to give your
child this cool snazzy toy,

1003
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:39,530
and all they want to do is
play with the box, right?

1004
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:42,414
So what that shows us is we're
not good models, necessarily.

1005
00:37:42,414 --> 00:37:44,330
We have to kind of
determine this empirically.

1006
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:49,550
We can't necessarily use our own
intuitions to figure this out.

1007
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:52,190
Another question is how
are costs read, right?

1008
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:54,000
So in the first
study I showed you

1009
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,270
that infants' experience
potentially is important,

1010
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:58,869
or factors that gait
infants' experience, right?

1011
00:37:58,869 --> 00:38:00,410
But that's in a
situation where there

1012
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:03,220
aren't a lot of
observable cues to effort.

1013
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,970
So I think it may be
the case that there's

1014
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:06,350
some variability here.

1015
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:09,080
Some costs infants
may require experience

1016
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:12,530
with in order to figure out
what is the cost, right?

1017
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:13,709
How much of a cost is this?

1018
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:16,250
And maybe there are other costs
that infants can more readily

1019
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:19,250
read from the get go.

1020
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:21,390
And then, finally, I
think at some point,

1021
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:23,390
we need to ask whether
infants and, potentially,

1022
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:26,622
children are sensitive to other
types of costs beyond effort.

1023
00:38:26,622 --> 00:38:29,080
Also, if they have a kind of
higher level category of cost.

1024
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,490
So one thing that's really
interesting in the literature

1025
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:33,500
on nonhuman animals
is that there are just

1026
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,260
so simple neural systems
that are responsible

1027
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,210
for effort reward
decision-making,

1028
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:40,130
and for delay reward
decision-making.

1029
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:42,350
But, obviously, we, as
adults, can group these things

1030
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:44,660
together, or I wouldn't be
able to give this talk today,

1031
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:47,030
and Laura wouldn't have been
able to give her talk today.

1032
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:49,160
So one of the things we
have to start to understand

1033
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,530
is when did those things
kind of come together

1034
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:53,940
in service of this
larger category of cost.
