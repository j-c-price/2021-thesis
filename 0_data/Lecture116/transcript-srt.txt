 chat and then we'll talk to them

12
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,480
 

13
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,160
 uh at the end of this session there so

14
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,160
 

15
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,439
 we're gonna talk about this idea

16
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:19,439
 

17
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,600
 uh around dojos if you don't know the

18
00:00:19,429 --> 00:00:21,600
 

19
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,560
 the idea or concept of a dojo don't

20
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:22,560
 

21
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,000
 worry about it

22
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,000
 

23
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,840
 uh what we really actually want to talk

24
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,840
 

25
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,359
 about is this how do you take

26
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,359
 

27
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,359
 uh ideas and practices uh in the devops

28
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:31,359
 

29
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,960
 or agile or product thinking or

30
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:32,960
 

31
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,399
 really any kind of space and actually

32
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,399
 

33
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,160
 get them to stick

34
00:00:34,389 --> 00:00:36,160
 

35
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,280
 that's what i've been working on for a

36
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,280
 

37
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,840
 few years now and i want to give you

38
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:37,840
 

39
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,360
 some

40
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,360
 

41
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,280
 some context around and tell you how

42
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:41,280
 

43
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,920
 it's been working

44
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,920
 

45
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,520
 uh so before we even get into it i'd be

46
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,520
 

47
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,239
 remiss if i didn't mention this

48
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:46,239
 

49
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,800
 gentleman

50
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:48,800
 

51
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,920
 uh for those that that don't know uh

52
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:49,920
 

53
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,480
 this person

54
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:52,480
 

55
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,719
 uh it's david hussman a big influence in

56
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,719
 

57
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,840
 my life as well as a dear friend that

58
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:57,840
 

59
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,520
 passed a few years ago david was pretty

60
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:59,520
 

61
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,719
 fundamental in a lot of things in the

62
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:00,719
 

63
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,399
 azure community

64
00:01:00,709 --> 00:01:02,399
 

65
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,840
 uh if you don't know him i suggest you

66
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:03,840
 

67
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,559
 look it up and so this is my way of

68
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:04,559
 

69
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,439
 saying

70
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:07,439
 

71
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,000
 uh even if i am horrible today at least

72
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:08,000
 

73
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,600
 i know

74
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:09,600
 

75
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,119
 i'll have exposed some people to the

76
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,119
 

77
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,720
 great work of david hussman and you'll

78
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:12,720
 

79
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,960
 get some value out of that

80
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,960
 

81
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,840
 a great thinker and a great friend and

82
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:15,840
 

83
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,040
 his impact

84
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,040
 

85
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,520
 i think is still being felt in the

86
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:19,520
 

87
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,479
 community so let's get into this dojo

88
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:20,479
 

89
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,720
 stuff

90
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:24,720
 

91
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:27,040
 so that's me uh in more physical times

92
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,040
 

93
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,960
 there's some some background stuff on me

94
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,960
 

95
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,840
 the the takeaway really for you here

96
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,840
 

97
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,000
 is um so my background i i did the

98
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,000
 

99
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,600
 engineering stuff i got into the xp

100
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,600
 

101
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,439
 space in the early 2000s um did the

102
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,439
 

103
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,799
 the agile coaching stuff i taught

104
00:01:39,429 --> 00:01:40,799
 

105
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,479
 courses um

106
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:42,479
 

107
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,560
 and so what i want you to think about is

108
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:44,560
 

109
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,520
 that i really i've been on

110
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:47,520
 

111
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,560
 both sides of the equation where i was

112
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,560
 

113
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,759
 an engineer

114
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:51,759
 

115
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,720
 trying to learn new things and trying to

116
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:52,720
 

117
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,079
 figure out how to

118
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,079
 

119
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:59,119
 get the new things to work i was

120
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:59,119
 

121
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,960
 a coach talking about how why teams

122
00:01:59,109 --> 00:02:00,960
 

123
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,360
 should kind of do things or help

124
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,360
 

125
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,520
 teams do things a different way and i've

126
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,520
 

127
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,479
 taught lots of courses

128
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:08,479
 

129
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,119
 and so i've seen the the courses where

130
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:09,119
 

131
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,239
 everybody

132
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:12,239
 

133
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:14,000
 succeeds in the course but then they go

134
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:14,000
 

135
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,200
 back to work and they can't apply it for

136
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,200
 

137
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,400
 a variety of reasons

138
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,400
 

139
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,879
 and that's what that's what i want you

140
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,879
 

141
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,160
 to take away is really that

142
00:02:18,869 --> 00:02:20,160
 

143
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,080
 this stuff that we're talking around

144
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,080
 

145
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,680
 around learning and getting this these

146
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,680
 

147
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,760
 ideas and practices this stick

148
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,760
 

149
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,120
 it's not like it's not coming out of

150
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,120
 

151
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,920
 nowhere it's uh

152
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:29,920
 

153
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,959
 it's grounded in reality and so we've

154
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:30,959
 

155
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,720
 been through a lot of these

156
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:32,720
 

157
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,640
 these things have a lot of experience

158
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,640
 

159
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,200
 and been through a lot of evolution

160
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,200
 

161
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,920
 um and so i get really excited about

162
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:37,920
 

163
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,840
 helping

164
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,840
 

165
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,200
 organizations learn i think it's a it's

166
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,200
 

167
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,519
 a fundamental need

168
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,519
 

169
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,239
 if you're trying to any kind of uh

170
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:46,239
 

171
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,480
 evolution of the way you work

172
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:48,480
 

173
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,480
 this is pretty fundamental in my

174
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,480
 

175
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,200
 perspective and in my view of the world

176
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,200
 

177
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,400
 um many organizations are talking about

178
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,400
 

179
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,560
 transformation

180
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,560
 

181
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,920
 we need to transform we need to

182
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,920
 

183
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,480
 transform

184
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:00,480
 

185
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,959
 but they want to do it quickly they want

186
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:00,959
 

187
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,599
 to know

188
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:03,599
 

189
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,879
 how does how do you transform quick and

190
00:03:03,589 --> 00:03:04,879
 

191
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,840
 how do i do it like

192
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:07,840
 

193
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,120
 everybody else uh and how do i how do i

194
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,120
 

195
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,800
 make sure

196
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,800
 

197
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,560
 that it doesn't cost too much and it

198
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,560
 

199
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,280
 scales really fast and they ask all

200
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,280
 

201
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,319
 these

202
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,319
 

203
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,640
 really i guess uh questions with good

204
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:18,640
 

205
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,440
 intent but they're the wrong questions

206
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,440
 

207
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,480
 um any organization as deming said

208
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,480
 

209
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,680
 decades ago

210
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,680
 

211
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,519
 that's trying to do anything

212
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,519
 

213
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,280
 substantially different has to commit to

214
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:27,280
 

215
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,280
 new ways of learning

216
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,280
 

217
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,840
 and i think that's what we're doing in

218
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,840
 

219
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,879
 these dojos is looking at new ways of

220
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:32,879
 

221
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,680
 learning

222
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:35,680
 

223
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,280
 so with that being said what does it

224
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,280
 

225
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,920
 fundamentally take

226
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,920
 

227
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,000
 to learn right so this is a simple way

228
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,000
 

229
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,000
 of kind of thinking about things

230
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:44,000
 

231
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,120
 uh you'll need some kind of sense of

232
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,120
 

233
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,400
 repetition

234
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,400
 

235
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,720
 right you can't just learn something

236
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,720
 

237
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,000
 once and say check i've done it

238
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,000
 

239
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,360
 therefore i'm good

240
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,360
 

241
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,760
 you need to be able to experiment and

242
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,760
 

243
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,439
 see how things uh play and how things

244
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,439
 

245
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,040
 evolve over time

246
00:03:55,429 --> 00:03:57,040
 

247
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,959
 learning needs to be a continuation

248
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,959
 

249
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,040
 thing the learning needs to grow

250
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:01,040
 

251
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,480
 similar to repetition it's not stagnant

252
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,480
 

253
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,840
 and once you learn you're done

254
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,840
 

255
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,680
 it's like just like the whole idea of

256
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,680
 

257
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,360
 transformation is false because it

258
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,360
 

259
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,200
 assumes that you're done

260
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,200
 

261
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,959
 learning is never done transformation is

262
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,959
 

263
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,239
 never done so the language is already

264
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:12,239
 

265
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,760
 broke

266
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:13,760
 

267
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,920
 for learning to be effective it has to

268
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,920
 

269
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,000
 have context it has to mean something to

270
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,000
 

271
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,239
 people it can't be abstract

272
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,239
 

273
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,280
 and it needs to be based in experience

274
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:21,280
 

275
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,880
 um

276
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,880
 

277
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,040
 there's a lot of interesting language

278
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,040
 

279
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,560
 around knowledge people talk about

280
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,560
 

281
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,520
 knowledge transfers

282
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,520
 

283
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,280
 as if i could give you my knowledge but

284
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,280
 

285
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,600
 the reality is we live in a complicated

286
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:31,600
 

287
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,000
 and

288
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,000
 

289
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,680
 complex world where learning isn't

290
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,680
 

291
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,240
 something you can just hand over

292
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,240
 

293
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,759
 you have to experience these things so

294
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,759
 

295
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,320
 that's what's fundamentally needed to

296
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:40,320
 

297
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,160
 learn

298
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,160
 

299
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,000
 if we look at a little bit deeper this

300
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,000
 

301
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:48,720
 was a

302
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:48,720
 

303
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,639
 simple graph from herman ebbinghaus

304
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,639
 

305
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,320
 german scientists from like the late

306
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:52,320
 

307
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,960
 1800s

308
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,960
 

309
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,320
 this is pretty obvious to anybody

310
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,320
 

311
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,240
 especially in our fields

312
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,240
 

313
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,680
 what this curve is mentioning is that if

314
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,680
 

315
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,800
 you learn something

316
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:02,800
 

317
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,960
 and you don't reinforce it

318
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,960
 

319
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,520
 over the course of a few days you forget

320
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,520
 

321
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,240
 it right so if i learn something in time

322
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,240
 

323
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,800
 zero

324
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,800
 

325
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,160
 and i don't reinforce it on day one by

326
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,160
 

327
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,080
 day six it's kind of

328
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,080
 

329
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,400
 it might as well not have even happened

330
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,400
 

331
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,639
 but if i can reinforce the learning

332
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,639
 

333
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,680
 uh the second day and the third day and

334
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:19,680
 

335
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,600
 the fourth day

336
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,600
 

337
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,600
 the chances of me forgetting it and the

338
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,600
 

339
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,280
 tale to forget is substantially

340
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,280
 

341
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,360
 diminished and so

342
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,360
 

343
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,520
 we fundamentally need repetition of

344
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,520
 

345
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,360
 learning we can't just

346
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,360
 

347
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,440
 say we learned and we're done and we

348
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,440
 

349
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,880
 need to come back to that idea of we

350
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,880
 

351
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,720
 need to see how the

352
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,720
 

353
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,639
 things we've learned apply in different

354
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,639
 

355
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,120
 scenarios we need to

356
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:41,120
 

357
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,120
 contextualize and deepen our

358
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,120
 

359
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,639
 understanding of how these ideas work if

360
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,639
 

361
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,120
 we don't then we're just falling into

362
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:47,120
 

363
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,320
 something that we knew 150 years ago

364
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,320
 

365
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,199
 didn't work for learning

366
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,199
 

367
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,800
 we would just forget things and then you

368
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:52,800
 

369
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,720
 have this kind of space where

370
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,720
 

371
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,840
 many organizations claim to be learning

372
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:55,840
 

373
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,919
 organizations

374
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,919
 

375
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,120
 uh i'm sure you've all seen something

376
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:59,120
 

377
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,319
 similar to this we're a learning

378
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,319
 

379
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,960
 organization we're a learning

380
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:00,960
 

381
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,280
 organization

382
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,280
 

383
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,360
 20 of the year you get to learn so that

384
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,360
 

385
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,800
 means you'll go for about three months

386
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,800
 

387
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,000
 and then you get to go to a course or

388
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,000
 

389
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,759
 maybe you get to go to a

390
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,759
 

391
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,440
 conference like this and then you don't

392
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:11,440
 

393
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,319
 get to do anything for six months and at

394
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,319
 

395
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,160
 the end of the year

396
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:14,160
 

397
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,919
 somebody says but you have to spend a

398
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,919
 

399
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,120
 lot of time on learning

400
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:19,120
 

401
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:21,440
 that is not a learning culture that is

402
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,440
 

403
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,639
 business as normal where learning is the

404
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,639
 

405
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,039
 outlier

406
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:25,039
 

407
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,759
 right it's this just statistically

408
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:25,759
 

409
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,440
 speaking

410
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:27,440
 

411
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,680
 so for trying to have this culture of

412
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,680
 

413
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,319
 learning we can't just say we learn

414
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,319
 

415
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,000
 when it's convenient it has to be just

416
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,000
 

417
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,360
 how we do things we have to always be

418
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,360
 

419
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,720
 looking at opportunities to learn and

420
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,720
 

421
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,759
 learning has to be

422
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:39,759
 

423
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,960
 a foundation of how we work

424
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:40,960
 

425
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,120
 and then giving back to this this

426
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,120
 

427
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,039
 wonderful picture uh you know

428
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,039
 

429
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,800
 this gentleman he's pouring in his

430
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,800
 

431
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,280
 knowledge into bottles and he's selling

432
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:47,280
 

433
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,280
 his

434
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,280
 

435
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,680
 knowledge at the at the local store

436
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,680
 

437
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,000
 right i mean this is how knowledge

438
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:54,000
 

439
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,440
 transfers i just pour my knowledge into

440
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:57,440
 

441
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,520
 a cup and i hand it around and it works

442
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,520
 

443
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,800
 that you all know that's not how

444
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,800
 

445
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,960
 anything works

446
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,960
 

447
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,960
 i'm sure i'm sure in your organizations

448
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,960
 

449
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,720
 you have something like a confluence or

450
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,720
 

451
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,280
 a sharepoint or something like that with

452
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:09,280
 

453
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,280
 all kinds of things documented

454
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,280
 

455
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,319
 that when you read them they don't

456
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,319
 

457
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,560
 really work

458
00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:14,560
 

459
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,160
 and maybe they don't work because you

460
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,160
 

461
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,319
 don't understand it or you don't have

462
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,319
 

463
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,199
 the context of it or maybe just it's a

464
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:19,199
 

465
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,680
 fundamentally

466
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:21,680
 

467
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,880
 bad way of doing things this idea that i

468
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:22,880
 

469
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,759
 can just tell you

470
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:25,759
 

471
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,400
 the knowledge and you'll internalize it

472
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:26,400
 

473
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,880
 is is

474
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,880
 

475
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,160
 a flawed not a flawed way of thinking

476
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,160
 

477
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,919
 about things

478
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,919
 

479
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,160
 in our world where we're working in

480
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:34,160
 

481
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,599
 dynamic and complex environments we need

482
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,599
 

483
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,039
 to stop thinking about knowledge

484
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:37,039
 

485
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,639
 transfers me to start thinking about

486
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:38,639
 

487
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,160
 knowledge creation

488
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:40,160
 

489
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,840
 how do we go about creating the

490
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,840
 

491
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,680
 knowledge internally

492
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,680
 

493
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,199
 right that's a that's a self thing

494
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,199
 

495
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,879
 that's not an external thing that's a

496
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:46,879
 

497
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,240
 self thing where i'm internalizing i'm

498
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:48,240
 

499
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,319
 creating it myself

500
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,319
 

501
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,080
 and i'm making it part of me as opposed

502
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:52,080
 

503
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,560
 to trying to be given it by somebody

504
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,560
 

505
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,560
 else

506
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,560
 

507
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,319
 so again these knowledge transfers need

508
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,319
 

509
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,720
 to go we need to get back to a space of

510
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,720
 

511
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:02,479
 knowledge creation

512
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:02,479
 

513
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:05,680
 and lastly this idea of experience based

514
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:05,680
 

515
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:07,599
 this picture is a is one of my tattoos

516
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,599
 

517
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,520
 uh on my arm and so here's why i bring

518
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:09,520
 

519
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,840
 this up

520
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,840
 

521
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,879
 similar to the idea of documenting

522
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,879
 

523
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,000
 things

524
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:16,000
 

525
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,800
 uh even if the documents were right and

526
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:16,800
 

527
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,479
 we read them

528
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,479
 

529
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,400
 and we follow the steps that doesn't

530
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:20,400
 

531
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,720
 mean we learned how it works

532
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,720
 

533
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,319
 we might have all the documentation and

534
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,319
 

535
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,479
 it might work around how you get your

536
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:26,479
 

537
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,400
 application deployed in the cloud

538
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:28,400
 

539
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,720
 but as soon as one little piece doesn't

540
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,720
 

541
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,560
 work or one little piece changes

542
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,560
 

543
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,200
 you've lost you you don't know how it

544
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:35,200
 

545
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,760
 works because you didn't experience

546
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,760
 

547
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,800
 the the the knowledge creation to get

548
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,800
 

549
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,039
 there

550
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:41,039
 

551
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,719
 this idea so this tying back to the

552
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:42,719
 

553
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,880
 tattoo when i was talking

554
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:44,880
 

555
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,120
 to my tattoo artist and i go how did you

556
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,120
 

557
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,120
 get uh involved in tattoos i

558
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,120
 

559
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,640
 i hope you just didn't say one day you

560
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,640
 

561
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,360
 were really good at drawing so i'm going

562
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,360
 

563
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,279
 to

564
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,279
 

565
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,399
 permanently put something on somebody

566
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:54,399
 

567
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,440
 and he goes no no

568
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:55,440
 

569
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,440
 that would be that would be

570
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,440
 

571
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,279
 irresponsible uh he

572
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,279
 

573
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,800
 i go well what help me understand how

574
00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:00,800
 

575
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,839
 you become a tattoo artist and he says

576
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,839
 

577
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,600
 well

578
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:03,600
 

579
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,680
 uh of course you need to study things

580
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,680
 

581
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,959
 and be good at drawing and concepts in

582
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,959
 

583
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,320
 life but he goes you don't just start

584
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:08,320
 

585
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,240
 putting ink on people

586
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,240
 

587
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,920
 you actually have to experience how the

588
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,920
 

589
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,959
 ink works you have to experience how it

590
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:12,959
 

591
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,519
 goes into various

592
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:15,519
 

593
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,360
 uh mediums sometimes you talk about

594
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:17,360
 

595
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,399
 using various fruits like oranges and

596
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,399
 

597
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,720
 grapefruits

598
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:20,720
 

599
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,560
 just so you get a feel for how various

600
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,560
 

601
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,000
 tattoo guns worked and how various inks

602
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,000
 

603
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,120
 worked and how various

604
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:27,120
 

605
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,160
 uh uh densities of uh enviro

606
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:30,160
 

607
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,680
 of skin would respond to ink

608
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,680
 

609
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,760
 you couldn't just jump into something

610
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,760
 

611
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,240
 you had to experience it and so

612
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,240
 

613
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,000
 that's for tattooing stuff but but here

614
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:38,000
 

615
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,920
 we are in our world where we're saying

616
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,920
 

617
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,160
 we have this complicated environment

618
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:42,160
 

619
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,320
 with all this cloud deployments and

620
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,320
 

621
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,920
 and and future flags and we're doing

622
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,920
 

623
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,519
 product thinking and experiments but

624
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,519
 

625
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,040
 just document it all

626
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:51,040
 

627
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,360
 and you'll figure it out so look

628
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,360
 

629
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,720
 if you ever go get a tattoo and a tattoo

630
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,720
 

631
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,560
 artist and you ask him how he got

632
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,560
 

633
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,720
 started and the tattoo artist says

634
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,720
 

635
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,120
 i just read a good article in confluence

636
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,120
 

637
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,839
 don't get that tattoo

638
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,839
 

639
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,399
 you need to have experience in your

640
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:04,399
 

641
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,200
 learning

642
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:07,200
 

643
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,800
 we can't copy things we can't we can't

644
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,800
 

645
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,760
 just say we'll be like spotify or be

646
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:09,760
 

647
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,760
 netflix

648
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,760
 

649
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,920
 we security models because they're kind

650
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,920
 

651
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,640
 of nonsensical these things don't work

652
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,640
 

653
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,240
 even toyota they've always open source

654
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,240
 

655
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,880
 the way they did things because they

656
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:18,880
 

657
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,800
 knew

658
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,800
 

659
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,880
 that they could tell you what they were

660
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,880
 

661
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,279
 doing but if you just copied what they

662
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:23,279
 

663
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,519
 did

664
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:25,519
 

665
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,959
 you lost the ability to learn how they

666
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:26,959
 

667
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,839
 got there

668
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:29,839
 

669
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,680
 you can't copy you can't compare you

670
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,680
 

671
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,720
 can't be disconnected from reality and

672
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,720
 

673
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,560
 say

674
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,560
 

675
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,079
 we need to have a maturity model we need

676
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,079
 

677
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,680
 to get better at these things

678
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:39,680
 

679
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:42,800
 you have to fundamentally learn

680
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:42,800
 

681
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:45,360
 all right enough of my soapboxing there

682
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,360
 

683
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:48,079
 is no such thing as transformations

684
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:48,079
 

685
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,760
 all we can do is continuously embrace

686
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:49,760
 

687
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,839
 learning and continuously work on

688
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,839
 

689
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,120
 improving the way we work and look at

690
00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:53,120
 

691
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,680
 learning as a way of

692
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,680
 

693
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,000
 getting us there so how does the dojo

694
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:58,000
 

695
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,680
 fit into my rant

696
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,680
 

697
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,600
 we need a learning organization

698
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,600
 

699
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,120
 fundamentally needs these things we talk

700
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,120
 

701
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,720
 about repetition and continuation and

702
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,720
 

703
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,079
 context and experience

704
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,079
 

705
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,600
 i also threw this one down in there

706
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:07,600
 

707
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,279
 called around double loop learning

708
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,279
 

709
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,519
 you're all systems thinkers

710
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:11,519
 

711
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,560
 you understand double loop learning but

712
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:12,560
 

713
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,640
 if you want to be

714
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,640
 

715
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,519
 more than just an individual or team

716
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,519
 

717
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,640
 learner and you want the learning to be

718
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,640
 

719
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:19,760
 organizationally you have to have some

720
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,760
 

721
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,279
 sense of double loop learning

722
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,279
 

723
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,680
 so we'll talk about how the dojo fits

724
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:23,680
 

725
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,680
 into there

726
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:23,750
 

727
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:31,120
 so enter the dojo so if

728
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:31,120
 

729
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:34,720
 here's the the quick spiel on the dojo

730
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:34,720
 

731
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:38,000
 uh it is simply put an immersive

732
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:38,000
 

733
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,240
 learning environment that

734
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:40,240
 

735
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 that's the simplest way of putting it

736
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:42,000
 

737
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,519
 now what we do inside the dojo

738
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:45,519
 

739
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:49,200
 is we bring in full teams full

740
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:49,200
 

741
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:51,760
 product product teams and they learn

742
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,760
 

743
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,639
 new practices new approaches to building

744
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,639
 

745
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,720
 things

746
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,720
 

747
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,720
 maybe new ways of delivering or testing

748
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,720
 

749
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,320
 ideas but they learn all these things

750
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,320
 

751
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,760
 and practices

752
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:01,760
 

753
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,839
 while working on their real products

754
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,839
 

755
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,800
 uh within the constraints of their

756
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:04,800
 

757
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,920
 organizations

758
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,920
 

759
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:10,399
 so there are no sandboxes there is no i

760
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,399
 

761
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,320
 learned how to work on aws when i didn't

762
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:12,320
 

763
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,360
 have to worry about the vpcs and the

764
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,360
 

765
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,760
 firewalls

766
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,760
 

767
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,839
 there is no well yeah agile made a lot

768
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,839
 

769
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,480
 of sense when it was a made-up product

770
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:20,480
 

771
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,360
 and i got to play with legos i love

772
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,360
 

773
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,160
 legos

774
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:24,160
 

775
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,240
 but the dojo is about you have a real

776
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,240
 

777
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,000
 thing that you're trying to build

778
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,000
 

779
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,600
 and you need to learn and figure out

780
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,600
 

781
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,320
 ways of doing it and you can't

782
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:30,320
 

783
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,079
 necessarily

784
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,079
 

785
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,920
 change all the things that are implied

786
00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:33,920
 

787
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,600
 inside your organization all the audits

788
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,600
 

789
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,360
 and all the security policies

790
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,360
 

791
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,959
 so we have to learn how to apply these

792
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,959
 

793
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,200
 practices

794
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:41,200
 

795
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,440
 while doing our work we want that

796
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:43,440
 

797
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,600
 context and so the dojo is that

798
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,600
 

799
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,360
 it is how do we learn and apply these

800
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,360
 

801
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,720
 things immediately

802
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,720
 

803
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,560
 to our product within all these

804
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,560
 

805
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,000
 constraints

806
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:54,000
 

807
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:57,200
 the dojo is usually

808
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:57,200
 

809
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,800
 pre march of 2020 uh is usually a

810
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,800
 

811
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,560
 physical place and we can talk about the

812
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,560
 

813
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,560
 benefits of that in a little bit

814
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,560
 

815
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,720
 now it's more of a virtual space but the

816
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,720
 

817
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,360
 dojo is a way of thinking

818
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:07,360
 

819
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,360
 and as well as a physical place of being

820
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,360
 

821
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,800
 and practicing

822
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,800
 

823
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,639
 just so you don't think i'm crazy some

824
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,639
 

825
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:16,160
 pictures of dojos throughout

826
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:16,160
 

827
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:18,639
 the united states they're all

828
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:18,639
 

829
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,480
 different as you can see the things i

830
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:20,480
 

831
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,279
 would call out is a lot of

832
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:23,279
 

833
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,240
 uh visualizations around the teams we

834
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,240
 

835
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,680
 don't

836
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:27,680
 

837
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:30,959
 we default to visually visual learning

838
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:30,959
 

839
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:33,040
 and uh externalizing our ideas

840
00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:33,040
 

841
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,079
 explain our ideas draw them we do a lot

842
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,079
 

843
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,200
 of things

844
00:13:34,069 --> 00:13:37,200
 

845
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,959
 uh visually a lot of collaboration we

846
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,959
 

847
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,040
 default to mobbing

848
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:41,040
 

849
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,320
 because the dojo isn't about individual

850
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,320
 

851
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,399
 learning it's about

852
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,399
 

853
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,560
 uh social and team learning so we're

854
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:46,560
 

855
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,680
 creating experiences together

856
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,680
 

857
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,600
 the other thing that you can notice in

858
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,600
 

859
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:53,360
 these pictures is that

860
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:53,360
 

861
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:56,079
 uh the dojo when it's a physical space

862
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,079
 

863
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,199
 goes to a high density uh learning

864
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:57,199
 

865
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,600
 environment

866
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:59,600
 

867
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:01,279
 we like to have lots of teams learning

868
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,279
 

869
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,240
 in the same space together

870
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:04,240
 

871
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:06,079
 with minimal separation and that creates

872
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,079
 

873
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,880
 this nice energy but it also creates

874
00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:06,880
 

875
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,880
 this

876
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,880
 

877
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,399
 uh residual effect where teams start

878
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,399
 

879
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,040
 learning from each other

880
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:13,040
 

881
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,720
 on this picture in the left the the the

882
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,720
 

883
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,000
 team that's sitting down was at an

884
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,000
 

885
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,560
 infrastructure team and the team

886
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,560
 

887
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,880
 that wasn't there yet during the day was

888
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,880
 

889
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:24,160
 actually a team doing embedded software

890
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:24,160
 

891
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:27,279
 uh for um engines

892
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:27,279
 

893
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,399
 and so pretty different domains but the

894
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:28,399
 

895
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,160
 amount of times

896
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:30,160
 

897
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,160
 that they would get and talk get up and

898
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:32,160
 

899
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,519
 talk to each other because they had

900
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,519
 

901
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,920
 common interests

902
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:35,920
 

903
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,360
 never happened outside of the dojo but

904
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,360
 

905
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,959
 now they started connecting and sharing

906
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,959
 

907
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,880
 ideas and started thinking about

908
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:40,880
 

909
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,240
 how those other ideas might apply to

910
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,240
 

911
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,760
 their domains so again it's about

912
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,760
 

913
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,160
 creating this environment

914
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,160
 

915
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,800
 where learning becomes the first thing

916
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,800
 

917
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,120
 we do

918
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:49,120
 

919
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,440
 becomes what we always do how do we get

920
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,440
 

921
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,360
 more ideas going

922
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:53,360
 

923
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,880
 and just to show you it doesn't stop i

924
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,880
 

925
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,800
 guess necessarily because of

926
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:58,800
 

927
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:01,040
 uh kovid this is how dojos look

928
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:01,040
 

929
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,440
 today this is actually a picture back

930
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:03,440
 

931
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,440
 from april uh with a team

932
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:05,440
 

933
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,600
 now it's a lot of zoom stuff we still do

934
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,600
 

935
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,000
 the same things we have different tools

936
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:10,000
 

937
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,839
 uh it's challenging i'm not gonna lie to

938
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:10,839
 

939
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,600
 you it's

940
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:13,600
 

941
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:14,720
 challenging uh to get the same level of

942
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,720
 

943
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,600
 cross-team

944
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:17,600
 

945
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,160
 learning happening but the internal team

946
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,160
 

947
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,880
 uh

948
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,880
 

949
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,920
 learns a lot and it's an invigorating

950
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:21,920
 

951
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,480
 experience

952
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:24,480
 

953
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,320
 and just to let you know it is possible

954
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,320
 

955
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,880
 so again this idea of dojo's physical

956
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:26,880
 

957
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,600
 place

958
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:29,600
 

959
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,600
 learning first

960
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:30,550
 

961
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:36,160
 the teams in the dojo are as i mentioned

962
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:36,160
 

963
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,399
 learning in the context so one of those

964
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:38,399
 

965
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,959
 fundamental things we talked about is

966
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:40,959
 

967
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,800
 the creation of knowledge and in the

968
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:42,800
 

969
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:45,440
 context of the knowledge

970
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,440
 

971
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,880
 so the dojo is focused on knowledge

972
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:46,880
 

973
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,160
 creation

974
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:50,160
 

975
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:52,639
 we are looking at applying new practices

976
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,639
 

977
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,880
 while we are actually building uh other

978
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:54,880
 

979
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,880
 products that that to us is the

980
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,880
 

981
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,240
 is the sweet spot where we can start

982
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,240
 

983
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,600
 instead of talking about

984
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,600
 

985
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,199
 well you should do test driven

986
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,199
 

987
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,720
 development let me show you how to write

988
00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:02,720
 

989
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:05,199
 a unit test for fizzbuzz

990
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:05,199
 

991
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,040
 we can say you're trying to build this

992
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:07,040
 

993
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,959
 this new piece of functionality

994
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,959
 

995
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,639
 what's hard about adding that new piece

996
00:16:08,949 --> 00:16:10,639
 

997
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,199
 of functionality oh this is hard

998
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:13,199
 

999
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,560
 okay well how would you test if that

1000
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:14,560
 

1001
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,079
 piece of functionality was there and

1002
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,079
 

1003
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,320
 then you start thinking through

1004
00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:18,320
 

1005
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,720
 applying a testing practice learning how

1006
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,720
 

1007
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,480
 to refactor in the context of a product

1008
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,480
 

1009
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,839
 and everything starts to make sense and

1010
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,839
 

1011
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,480
 they start to see the value of the

1012
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:24,480
 

1013
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,120
 practices

1014
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:27,120
 

1015
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,759
 so again we're learning in context we're

1016
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:27,759
 

1017
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,040
 applying

1018
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:29,040
 

1019
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,000
 we're learning it and we're doing it

1020
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:32,000
 

1021
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,000
 socially and together

1022
00:16:32,069 --> 00:16:32,069
 

1023
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:36,079
 we look at learning as a whole value

1024
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:36,079
 

1025
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,880
 stream

1026
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:38,880
 

1027
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:40,399
 so this is fundamentally different than

1028
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,399
 

1029
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,680
 any other way of learning

1030
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:43,680
 

1031
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:46,800
 uh that um is is pre

1032
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,800
 

1033
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:49,600
 is currently being

1034
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:49,600
 

1035
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,680
 uh promoted a lot of our learning is

1036
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,680
 

1037
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,320
 about optimizing verticals inside of

1038
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,320
 

1039
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,519
 here

1040
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,519
 

1041
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,279
 you want a good good at product

1042
00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:55,279
 

1043
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,959
 discovery oh let me tell you how to do

1044
00:16:55,269 --> 00:16:56,959
 

1045
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,800
 personas and interviewing

1046
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:58,800
 

1047
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,399
 go to you and then that person should go

1048
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,399
 

1049
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,079
 to that class oh you want a good good

1050
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:02,079
 

1051
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,519
 product framing oh okay so you want to

1052
00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:03,519
 

1053
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,120
 learn how to do story mapping and write

1054
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:05,120
 

1055
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,959
 better stories okay

1056
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,959
 

1057
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,240
 you should go to a product owner class

1058
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:08,240
 

1059
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,480
 oh you want a good good at product

1060
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,480
 

1061
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,360
 delivery oh okay so send the engineers

1062
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,360
 

1063
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,280
 over here

1064
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:13,280
 

1065
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,039
 okay so you need to get better at devops

1066
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:15,039
 

1067
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,160
 okay the devops engineers need to go

1068
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:16,160
 

1069
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,760
 over here

1070
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,760
 

1071
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,520
 but the problem is that's just sub

1072
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,520
 

1073
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,679
 optimizing the whole

1074
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,679
 

1075
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,319
 when you're in essence creating learning

1076
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:24,319
 

1077
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:28,079
 uh iso you're creating learning silos

1078
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:28,079
 

1079
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:30,240
 when in reality skills are fundamentally

1080
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:30,240
 

1081
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,640
 complementary this is why teams need to

1082
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:32,640
 

1083
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,679
 come into the dojo together this is why

1084
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:33,679
 

1085
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,880
 they need to

1086
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:36,880
 

1087
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,160
 uh learn be full product teams is

1088
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,160
 

1089
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,799
 because

1090
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:40,799
 

1091
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,360
 you need to learn the seams across these

1092
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:41,360
 

1093
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,440
 things

1094
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,440
 

1095
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,640
 and and that's where the value lies in

1096
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,640
 

1097
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,960
 right and so

1098
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,960
 

1099
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,960
 imagine uh if you're trying to deploy

1100
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,960
 

1101
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,440
 something with a microservice

1102
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:51,440
 

1103
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,400
 it would be really powerful if the team

1104
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:52,400
 

1105
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,559
 came in together

1106
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:54,559
 

1107
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,760
 and they understood the product and they

1108
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:55,760
 

1109
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,000
 were able to do

1110
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,000
 

1111
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,440
 some light experimentation around what

1112
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,440
 

1113
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,120
 the product should look like and they

1114
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:01,120
 

1115
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,640
 understood the customers and they did

1116
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,640
 

1117
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,240
 some visualization around what the

1118
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,240
 

1119
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,480
 experiences might look like

1120
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,480
 

1121
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,640
 and using that knowledge they were able

1122
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,640
 

1123
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,400
 to apply domain driven design concepts

1124
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,400
 

1125
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,960
 because now they have context around the

1126
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:10,960
 

1127
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,720
 product

1128
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,720
 

1129
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,080
 as well as the product people that are

1130
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,080
 

1131
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,520
 less technical understand

1132
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,520
 

1133
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,679
 how these this concepts around

1134
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,679
 

1135
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,799
 domain-driven design actually ties into

1136
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:18,799
 

1137
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,640
 the product

1138
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:20,640
 

1139
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,000
 and then the delivery becomes simpler

1140
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,000
 

1141
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,240
 and makes more sense because we can talk

1142
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,240
 

1143
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,679
 about microservices and microservices

1144
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,679
 

1145
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,919
 just aren't microservices

1146
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:27,919
 

1147
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,760
 with rest endpoints microservices are

1148
00:18:27,909 --> 00:18:29,760
 

1149
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,200
 tied to a domain which is tied to a

1150
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,200
 

1151
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,160
 product and they have context and they

1152
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,160
 

1153
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,120
 have purpose

1154
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:35,120
 

1155
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,160
 and we can see how understanding the

1156
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,160
 

1157
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,480
 persona

1158
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,480
 

1159
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,600
 changes the domain changes the

1160
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:39,600
 

1161
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,600
 microservices

1162
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:41,600
 

1163
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,919
 and then even falls back into how we

1164
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,919
 

1165
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,679
 would monitor and want to deploy things

1166
00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:45,679
 

1167
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,440
 and then we get this nice feedback loop

1168
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:47,440
 

1169
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,440
 where we can actually have

1170
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,440
 

1171
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,280
 monitoring that feeds us back into our

1172
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51,280
 

1173
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,600
 discovery and creates a continuous

1174
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,600
 

1175
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,600
 learning loop of the product

1176
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,600
 

1177
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,960
 but if we bring in people or teams

1178
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,960
 

1179
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,760
 individually or we

1180
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,760
 

1181
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,600
 we optimize individual skills we lose

1182
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,600
 

1183
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,880
 the value of the seams

1184
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:02,880
 

1185
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,320
 and so that's what we're trying to do in

1186
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,320
 

1187
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,520
 the dojo here is we're trying to say

1188
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,520
 

1189
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,640
 whole teams

1190
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:08,640
 

1191
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,720
 whole value come in and learn things

1192
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,720
 

1193
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,400
 in your domain in your constraints but

1194
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,400
 

1195
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,919
 understand how the the learning

1196
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,919
 

1197
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,600
 reinforces itself

1198
00:19:13,909 --> 00:19:15,600
 

1199
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,480
 so we're trying to get this idea of

1200
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:18,480
 

1201
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,640
 reinforcing learning

1202
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,640
 

1203
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,160
 this is a real simple standard flow of

1204
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,160
 

1205
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,799
 what it looks like from a team

1206
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:24,799
 

1207
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,880
 perspective in this bigger uh squares

1208
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,880
 

1209
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,559
 that is the team experience

1210
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,559
 

1211
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,039
 you'll see things inside there that is

1212
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:31,039
 

1213
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:33,280
 really standard scrum types of things

1214
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:33,280
 

1215
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:35,280
 to the left of it is really just making

1216
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,280
 

1217
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,400
 sure before a team comes into this

1218
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,400
 

1219
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,960
 experience

1220
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:38,960
 

1221
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,720
 that uh they're aligned around what they

1222
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,720
 

1223
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,400
 want to learn and how that learning is

1224
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,400
 

1225
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,280
 going to help them

1226
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,280
 

1227
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,280
 sometimes uh we find out before a team

1228
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:47,280
 

1229
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,200
 comes in that the team isn't quite right

1230
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,200
 

1231
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,720
 and we need to rethink the team

1232
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,720
 

1233
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,400
 or sometimes the thinking on the

1234
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,400
 

1235
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,480
 management side is a little bit off

1236
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:54,480
 

1237
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,679
 i want my team to go to the dojo so they

1238
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,679
 

1239
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,679
 can get faster

1240
00:19:55,669 --> 00:19:57,679
 

1241
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,520
 that's not really what we're about so we

1242
00:19:57,669 --> 00:19:59,520
 

1243
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,440
 have to kind of mindset these things

1244
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,440
 

1245
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,679
 a big thing we stress in this idea of a

1246
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,679
 

1247
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,120
 consult we're talking to the team and

1248
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,120
 

1249
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,240
 we're talking to the management and we

1250
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,240
 

1251
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,640
 stress that it is

1252
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:08,640
 

1253
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,440
 learning over delivery what does that

1254
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,440
 

1255
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,760
 mean

1256
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,760
 

1257
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,520
 that means whatever kind of crazy metric

1258
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,520
 

1259
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,000
 you're using to measure deliveries

1260
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:16,000
 

1261
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,640
 velocity or story points or whatever

1262
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,640
 

1263
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,919
 kind of

1264
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:19,919
 

1265
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,039
 things are going on plan for half of

1266
00:20:19,909 --> 00:20:21,039
 

1267
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,799
 that

1268
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:22,799
 

1269
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,080
 so you're gonna be with us for six weeks

1270
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:24,080
 

1271
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,000
 dojo experiences last

1272
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:26,000
 

1273
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,280
 six weeks you're gonna be with us for

1274
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,280
 

1275
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,320
 six weeks if you planned

1276
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:30,320
 

1277
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:32,320
 that thing to get a hundred story points

1278
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:32,320
 

1279
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,960
 done plan for fifty

1280
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,960
 

1281
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,840
 why because we have to create space for

1282
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:35,840
 

1283
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,840
 learning

1284
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,840
 

1285
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,840
 if we start off by assuming we're gonna

1286
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,840
 

1287
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,280
 get just as much done while we learn

1288
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,280
 

1289
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,840
 that we're just we're just kidding

1290
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,840
 

1291
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:46,240
 ourselves now i'll tell you

1292
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:46,240
 

1293
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,280
 uh what typically happens when probably

1294
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,280
 

1295
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,080
 about threes fourths

1296
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:50,080
 

1297
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,159
 eighty percent of the time as a team

1298
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,159
 

1299
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,480
 slows down and they learn things

1300
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:54,480
 

1301
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,640
 they learn to fix systemic problems and

1302
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,640
 

1303
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,520
 they end up going faster at the

1304
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,520
 

1305
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,919
 tail end of their six weeks all those

1306
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,919
 

1307
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,200
 bad pipelines or building the wrong

1308
00:21:01,909 --> 00:21:03,200
 

1309
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,200
 thing

1310
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,200
 

1311
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,120
 they've learned to stop doing those

1312
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:07,120
 

1313
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,640
 things and doing more value-add things

1314
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,640
 

1315
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,000
 and so they actually appear to be going

1316
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,000
 

1317
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,600
 faster

1318
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,600
 

1319
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,360
 because they're doing less of the wrong

1320
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,360
 

1321
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,600
 and more of the right

1322
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,600
 

1323
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,200
 as teams come in they we work with them

1324
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,200
 

1325
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,320
 for six weeks we do some other kind of

1326
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,320
 

1327
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,360
 small things we'll talk about in a

1328
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,360
 

1329
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,120
 second here

1330
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,120
 

1331
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,039
 but then they start leaving and we look

1332
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:23,039
 

1333
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,559
 at support mechanisms around that

1334
00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:24,559
 

1335
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,400
 how is the learning going to stick we

1336
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:26,400
 

1337
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,159
 follow up to make sure the teams are

1338
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,159
 

1339
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,000
 are having success applying continuous

1340
00:21:28,149 --> 00:21:30,000
 

1341
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,960
 learning to their environments

1342
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:32,960
 

1343
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,520
 but the idea here too uh in this big

1344
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:33,520
 

1345
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,159
 square

1346
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:36,159
 

1347
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,919
 they're with us for six weeks why are

1348
00:21:36,149 --> 00:21:37,919
 

1349
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,000
 they with us for six weeks

1350
00:21:37,909 --> 00:21:40,000
 

1351
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,159
 for the repetition for the

1352
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:42,159
 

1353
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,640
 experimentation

1354
00:21:42,149 --> 00:21:44,640
 

1355
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,080
 uh we we're obviously we're doing things

1356
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,080
 

1357
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,679
 in context and we're doing things

1358
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,679
 

1359
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,440
 socially and we're creating we're doing

1360
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:49,440
 

1361
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,919
 knowledge creation but we're doing

1362
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,919
 

1363
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,120
 things over and over and over again in

1364
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:53,120
 

1365
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,559
 small pieces

1366
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,559
 

1367
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,320
 teams might build the thing they might

1368
00:21:54,549 --> 00:21:56,320
 

1369
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,200
 build a micro service and we'll say that

1370
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,200
 

1371
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,960
 was cool

1372
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,960
 

1373
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,400
 let's do it a different way and let's

1374
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,400
 

1375
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,080
 let's learn from it let's see if we can

1376
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:02,080
 

1377
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,080
 do it a different way and see if it

1378
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,080
 

1379
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,600
 changes our thinking of the problem so

1380
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,600
 

1381
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,120
 we'll do small experiments

1382
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,120
 

1383
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,600
 because that's what we're trying to do

1384
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:09,600
 

1385
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,960
 we're trying to learn how to learn

1386
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,960
 

1387
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,360
 again this is just a quick overview of

1388
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:13,360
 

1389
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:17,120
 how the the dojo comes together

1390
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:17,120
 

1391
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,720
 this is a quick view of

1392
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,720
 

1393
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,039
 what it might look like now the dojo

1394
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:21,039
 

1395
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,080
 experience for two teams in the same

1396
00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:22,080
 

1397
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,080
 organization

1398
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:24,080
 

1399
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,360
 is going to be different because the

1400
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,360
 

1401
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,640
 teams are different

1402
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,640
 

1403
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,480
 they're coming from a different starting

1404
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:28,480
 

1405
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,960
 point they have different needs

1406
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:30,960
 

1407
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,720
 they have different gaps this is two

1408
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,720
 

1409
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,000
 totally hypothetical experiences what

1410
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,000
 

1411
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,280
 one team might look like

1412
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,280
 

1413
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,960
 if they're doing more new product

1414
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,960
 

1415
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,320
 development versus another team that's

1416
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:38,320
 

1417
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,600
 trying to do a cloud migration or

1418
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,600
 

1419
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,720
 something else

1420
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:42,720
 

1421
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:46,480
 the thing the stress here is there is

1422
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:46,480
 

1423
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,000
 no playbook there is no playbook there

1424
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:48,000
 

1425
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,080
 is nothing that says

1426
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:50,080
 

1427
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,320
 on day three of week two your team will

1428
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:52,320
 

1429
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,640
 learn this that that is not how the dojo

1430
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:54,640
 

1431
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,320
 works the dojo works by saying

1432
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:56,320
 

1433
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,159
 uh what are the outcomes we're trying to

1434
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,159
 

1435
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,480
 get to how is learning going to help us

1436
00:22:58,149 --> 00:23:00,480
 

1437
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:03,039
 what are the things we want to learn

1438
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:03,039
 

1439
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,919
 and that's where we start but but it

1440
00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:03,919
 

1441
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,799
 turns out

1442
00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:06,799
 

1443
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,880
 as a good friend woody zulu say we

1444
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:08,880
 

1445
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,760
 learned the things we need to do by

1446
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:09,760
 

1447
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,320
 doing the work

1448
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:12,320
 

1449
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,120
 we learn the things we need to learn by

1450
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,120
 

1451
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,880
 doing the work

1452
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,880
 

1453
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,640
 and so we might think we need to learn

1454
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:16,640
 

1455
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,080
 six things and then find out one of them

1456
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,080
 

1457
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,120
 wasn't very important but two other

1458
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,120
 

1459
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,840
 things were

1460
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:21,840
 

1461
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,840
 and we continuously adapt and adapt and

1462
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,840
 

1463
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,799
 adjust as we go because we learn as we

1464
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,799
 

1465
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,200
 go

1466
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:27,200
 

1467
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,840
 so again it's going to give you an idea

1468
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:27,840
 

1469
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,520
 you learn

1470
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,520
 

1471
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,280
 a lot you're continuously learning but

1472
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,280
 

1473
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,360
 there is no playbook

1474
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:33,360
 

1475
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,559
 and that makes some people uncomfortable

1476
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,559
 

1477
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,240
 usually not the team

1478
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:36,240
 

1479
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:39,760
 usually more above and outside the team

1480
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:39,760
 

1481
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:42,480
 but it is a dynamic environment

1482
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,480
 

1483
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,799
 dojos are supported by coaches teams

1484
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:42,799
 

1485
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,080
 help

1486
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:44,080
 

1487
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,760
 teams like i mentioned when you have

1488
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,760
 

1489
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,960
 that nice physical environment but

1490
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:46,960
 

1491
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,919
 what's nice about this

1492
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:49,919
 

1493
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,200
 is when you when you start getting teams

1494
00:23:49,909 --> 00:23:51,200
 

1495
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,279
 together

1496
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:53,279
 

1497
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,440
 and they're learning and they're and

1498
00:23:53,269 --> 00:23:55,440
 

1499
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:57,279
 learning becomes how they work

1500
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:57,279
 

1501
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,960
 and then you get that team to help

1502
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,960
 

1503
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:01,440
 another team you start to get this

1504
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:01,440
 

1505
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,159
 this network of learners and you start

1506
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:02,159
 

1507
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,760
 to

1508
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,760
 

1509
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,000
 build this nice inertia inside of an

1510
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,000
 

1511
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,440
 organization where learning starts to

1512
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:07,440
 

1513
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,159
 become a given

1514
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:10,159
 

1515
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,960
 that's just how we work we're always

1516
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:10,960
 

1517
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,480
 thinking

1518
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,480
 

1519
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,000
 what's the what do i need to learn to

1520
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:14,000
 

1521
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,520
 kind of get here what's holding me back

1522
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,520
 

1523
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,240
 we're trying to become more aware of

1524
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,240
 

1525
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,320
 what's happening

1526
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,320
 

1527
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,600
 and slowing down and we're trying to

1528
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,600
 

1529
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,840
 take this idea of

1530
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:21,840
 

1531
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,840
 continuous experimentation to the our

1532
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,840
 

1533
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,520
 work at all times

1534
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,520
 

1535
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,360
 this is where it's funny gets into the

1536
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:27,360
 

1537
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,840
 double loop learning

1538
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,840
 

1539
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,640
 so what happens is the team is in

1540
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:30,640
 

1541
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,640
 essence the

1542
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,640
 

1543
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,480
 the the piece we're working on inside

1544
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,480
 

1545
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,320
 the dojo they're trying to build

1546
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:36,320
 

1547
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,360
 something for customers and deliver some

1548
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,360
 

1549
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,480
 kind of value but

1550
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:40,480
 

1551
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,200
 what's interesting is when you try and

1552
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,200
 

1553
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,760
 help a team

1554
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,760
 

1555
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,760
 learn you start to realize that there's

1556
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,760
 

1557
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,000
 assumptions inside the organization that

1558
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,000
 

1559
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,840
 are

1560
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,840
 

1561
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,360
 causing friction or constraints against

1562
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,360
 

1563
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,799
 the team's ability to learn

1564
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,799
 

1565
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,159
 and so then we have to go back and say

1566
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:52,159
 

1567
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,159
 well why are these kind of

1568
00:24:52,149 --> 00:24:54,159
 

1569
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,880
 organizational constraints here

1570
00:24:54,149 --> 00:24:56,880
 

1571
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,960
 why don't why do we need to make it so a

1572
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,960
 

1573
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,960
 team can't actually see their log files

1574
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,960
 

1575
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,720
 or a team can't deploy a server to a

1576
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:02,720
 

1577
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,520
 lower environment or a team can't

1578
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,520
 

1579
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,080
 talk to a customer why do we have these

1580
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,080
 

1581
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,760
 kind of

1582
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,760
 

1583
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,919
 constraints and so then we kind of roll

1584
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,919
 

1585
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,400
 back up into this higher level

1586
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:12,400
 

1587
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,600
 cross-team organizational level learning

1588
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:13,600
 

1589
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,799
 and so now

1590
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:16,799
 

1591
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,559
 by enabling the team to learn we've now

1592
00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:18,559
 

1593
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:20,159
 created a feedback loop where we're

1594
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:20,159
 

1595
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,000
 looking at how does the organization

1596
00:25:20,149 --> 00:25:22,000
 

1597
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:24,640
 learn and how does the leadership learn

1598
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:24,640
 

1599
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,520
 and so we get we this nice uh double

1600
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:25,520
 

1601
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,520
 loop learning

1602
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:27,520
 

1603
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,120
 aspect happening by by focusing on how

1604
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:29,120
 

1605
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,200
 to do these things inside the dojo

1606
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,200
 

1607
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,400
 but the dojo started with how do we just

1608
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,400
 

1609
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,120
 help teams

1610
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:35,120
 

1611
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,000
 apply concepts and they actually stick

1612
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,000
 

1613
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,919
 with them

1614
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,919
 

1615
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,120
 right how do we get them to actually use

1616
00:25:37,909 --> 00:25:39,120
 

1617
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,679
 agile in a nice way

1618
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:41,679
 

1619
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:44,880
 and use xp practices in the devops

1620
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:44,880
 

1621
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:46,480
 practice in a nice continuous way

1622
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,480
 

1623
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,480
 as soon as you start to do these things

1624
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,480
 

1625
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,320
 and the organization starts to learn you

1626
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:50,320
 

1627
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,440
 start to reveal all kinds all kinds of

1628
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,440
 

1629
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,039
 bias

1630
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:53,039
 

1631
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,880
 i'm sure none of your organizations that

1632
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:54,880
 

1633
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,320
 are here today would have any bias where

1634
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:56,320
 

1635
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,559
 you know if we just build it we'll be

1636
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:58,559
 

1637
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,480
 successful we tend to find that with a

1638
00:25:58,549 --> 00:26:00,480
 

1639
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,559
 lot of organizations that they

1640
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,559
 

1641
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,320
 want to do product things but they don't

1642
00:26:02,549 --> 00:26:04,320
 

1643
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,520
 have baselines or they've never been

1644
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,520
 

1645
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,559
 wrong

1646
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:08,559
 

1647
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:10,080
 these dojos tend to expose how wrong and

1648
00:26:08,549 --> 00:26:10,080
 

1649
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:12,080
 how often we are wrong

1650
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:12,080
 

1651
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,840
 and being wrong isn't a bad thing as

1652
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,840
 

1653
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,880
 long as we acknowledge it and we embrace

1654
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:14,880
 

1655
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,320
 kind of like

1656
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:16,320
 

1657
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,320
 man that was we learned something really

1658
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,320
 

1659
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,919
 interesting by being wrong and so we do

1660
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,919
 

1661
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,440
 some of these things this is an example

1662
00:26:19,909 --> 00:26:21,440
 

1663
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,440
 of delta next it's a simple

1664
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:23,440
 

1665
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,919
 practice we introduced to a lot of teams

1666
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:25,919
 

1667
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,240
 just so they can see

1668
00:26:25,909 --> 00:26:28,240
 

1669
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:31,520
 their ideas change and evolve over time

1670
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:31,520
 

1671
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:33,039
 it's a very powerful mechanism to show

1672
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:33,039
 

1673
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,200
 the biases you have and how to start

1674
00:26:33,029 --> 00:26:35,200
 

1675
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:37,440
 overcoming them

1676
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:37,440
 

1677
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,039
 so by now you're all super stoked and

1678
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,039
 

1679
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,159
 you're saying yeah

1680
00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:42,159
 

1681
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:43,679
 dojos are obviously the only way

1682
00:26:42,149 --> 00:26:43,679
 

1683
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:46,000
 that learning is going to be sticky or

1684
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:46,000
 

1685
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,600
 residual inside my organization you want

1686
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:47,600
 

1687
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,960
 to start these things

1688
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:50,960
 

1689
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:53,039
 here's uh here's my my

1690
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:53,039
 

1691
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,640
 first set of uh recommendations for you

1692
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:54,640
 

1693
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,159
 all

1694
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:56,159
 

1695
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,919
 i've seen too many organizations get

1696
00:26:56,149 --> 00:26:57,919
 

1697
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,799
 excited about dojos and just jump into

1698
00:26:57,909 --> 00:26:58,799
 

1699
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,600
 them

1700
00:26:58,789 --> 00:27:01,600
 

1701
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,720
 you have to have intention and purpose

1702
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:02,720
 

1703
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,440
 with your dojo

1704
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:05,440
 

1705
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,000
 so like what do i mean by that learning

1706
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,000
 

1707
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,400
 for learning

1708
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:08,400
 

1709
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 is fun but learning tied to an outcome

1710
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:10,000
 

1711
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,159
 is more interesting it's going to get

1712
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:12,159
 

1713
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,919
 you more buy in by your organization

1714
00:27:12,149 --> 00:27:13,919
 

1715
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,279
 at some point in time even if you do do

1716
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:15,279
 

1717
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,960
 a dojo somebody's going to say

1718
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:16,960
 

1719
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:19,279
 prove to me i should keep spending money

1720
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:19,279
 

1721
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,720
 on the dojo prove to me the return on

1722
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:20,720
 

1723
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,320
 investment of learning

1724
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:22,320
 

1725
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,000
 which fundamentally is an asinine

1726
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:24,000
 

1727
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,440
 question but let's be let's

1728
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:27,440
 

1729
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,039
 let's humor it and say okay somebody

1730
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:29,039
 

1731
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,600
 somebody wants to know why spending

1732
00:27:29,029 --> 00:27:31,600
 

1733
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:34,799
 money on learning uh is good

1734
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:34,799
 

1735
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:36,720
 if you can tie the learnings to an

1736
00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:36,720
 

1737
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:38,080
 impact inside your organization

1738
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,080
 

1739
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,159
 we need to get better at understanding

1740
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:40,159
 

1741
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,240
 our customers we need to get

1742
00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:42,240
 

1743
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,080
 reduced cycle time we need to actually

1744
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:44,080
 

1745
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,600
 increase life cycle profits

1746
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,600
 

1747
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,600
 if you can tie the learning to those

1748
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,600
 

1749
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,039
 kinds of things

1750
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,039
 

1751
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,640
 that will fundamentally answer that

1752
00:27:49,029 --> 00:27:50,640
 

1753
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,159
 question in a very easy way

1754
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:52,159
 

1755
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,000
 and as soon as you know those outcomes

1756
00:27:52,149 --> 00:27:54,000
 

1757
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,159
 you're going towards you can then start

1758
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:56,159
 

1759
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 saying these are the things we intend to

1760
00:27:56,149 --> 00:27:58,000
 

1761
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,720
 teach because it will lead us to those

1762
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:00,720
 

1763
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,760
 outcomes you can't teach everything to

1764
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:01,760
 

1765
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,200
 everybody

1766
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,200
 

1767
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,640
 you have to be intentional with what you

1768
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:04,640
 

1769
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,039
 want to learn which what you want to

1770
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:07,039
 

1771
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,520
 offer inside your dojo

1772
00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:09,520
 

1773
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,880
 you never tie dojos to the tools right

1774
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:10,880
 

1775
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,679
 you're you're all

1776
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:13,679
 

1777
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,120
 smarter than that time to practices tie

1778
00:28:13,669 --> 00:28:15,120
 

1779
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,520
 them to values

1780
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,520
 

1781
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,279
 right tools are always going to change

1782
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:19,279
 

1783
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,440
 the point of a dojo isn't

1784
00:28:19,269 --> 00:28:21,440
 

1785
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:23,440
 ever to get better at jenkins it's never

1786
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:23,440
 

1787
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:27,039
 to get better at writing stories

1788
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:27,039
 

1789
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:29,039
 it might be better at we want to get

1790
00:28:27,029 --> 00:28:29,039
 

1791
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,320
 quicker feedback loops on the quality of

1792
00:28:29,029 --> 00:28:30,320
 

1793
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,919
 our software we want to get

1794
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,919
 

1795
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,600
 we want to get better context on the

1796
00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:33,600
 

1797
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,200
 things that we're building so we want to

1798
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,200
 

1799
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,200
 get better at practices

1800
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,200
 

1801
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,960
 tools might help but we want to get

1802
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,960
 

1803
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,000
 better at practices because we have some

1804
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,000
 

1805
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,559
 kind of intrinsic

1806
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:42,559
 

1807
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,919
 core values beliefs that we have right

1808
00:28:42,549 --> 00:28:43,919
 

1809
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,520
 we want better feedback we want to

1810
00:28:43,909 --> 00:28:45,520
 

1811
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:47,760
 communicate more effectively

1812
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:47,760
 

1813
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,799
 so you're doing your dojo tie it to an

1814
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,799
 

1815
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,919
 outcome

1816
00:28:48,789 --> 00:28:51,919
 

1817
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:51,919
 tie it to practices

1818
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:52,950
 

1819
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,399
 i won't read you all this this is things

1820
00:28:54,789 --> 00:28:56,399
 

1821
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,880
 on the slides that you can you can check

1822
00:28:56,389 --> 00:28:56,880
 

1823
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,720
 out but

1824
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,720
 

1825
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,000
 i want to get to questions sooner here

1826
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,000
 

1827
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,039
 somebody's going to ask you how are

1828
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:01,039
 

1829
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,640
 dojos any different

1830
00:29:01,029 --> 00:29:02,640
 

1831
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,880
 right hopefully i've already stressed

1832
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:04,880
 

1833
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,320
 these quite a bit it's not single topic

1834
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:06,320
 

1835
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,440
 like a course would be it's never

1836
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,440
 

1837
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,080
 individual based it's

1838
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:10,080
 

1839
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,279
 team focused you do it inside your

1840
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,279
 

1841
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:15,200
 organization so you have

1842
00:29:11,269 --> 00:29:15,200
 

1843
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:19,120
 product context and your constraints

1844
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:19,120
 

1845
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:20,880
 the the cost is inversion

1846
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,880
 

1847
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,880
 right because if you have standard

1848
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,880
 

1849
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,159
 coursework it's high cost

1850
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:24,159
 

1851
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,919
 right it's high cost because you get to

1852
00:29:24,149 --> 00:29:25,919
 

1853
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,880
 pay so much for every single person and

1854
00:29:25,909 --> 00:29:26,880
 

1855
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:30,720
 in essence

1856
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:30,720
 

1857
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:32,640
 you get no immediate uh tiable

1858
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,640
 

1859
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,159
 impact to your product back so it's a

1860
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:34,159
 

1861
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,840
 high cost low investment you don't

1862
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:35,840
 

1863
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,080
 invest a lot of time in your people

1864
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:38,080
 

1865
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,600
 whereas the dojo is the opposite it's a

1866
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,600
 

1867
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,039
 high investment but it's a low cost

1868
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:41,039
 

1869
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,520
 because they're learning so much the

1870
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:41,520
 

1871
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,679
 unit

1872
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:43,679
 

1873
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,200
 is very low but it's investment in time

1874
00:29:43,669 --> 00:29:45,200
 

1875
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,000
 and people right so we gotta

1876
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:48,000
 

1877
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,279
 we gotta value understand that and if

1878
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:49,279
 

1879
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,840
 you're trying to get a dojo going by all

1880
00:29:49,269 --> 00:29:49,840
 

1881
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,039
 means

1882
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,039
 

1883
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,360
 go to the teams if you have to

1884
00:29:51,029 --> 00:29:53,360
 

1885
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:55,679
 especially in this covert world

1886
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:55,679
 

1887
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,120
 the idea really is to make sure that if

1888
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:57,120
 

1889
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,600
 you can't get a

1890
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:59,600
 

1891
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,960
 physical kind of dojo going or a

1892
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:00,960
 

1893
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,799
 repeatable dojo

1894
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,799
 

1895
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,559
 this idea of taking this concept to

1896
00:30:02,789 --> 00:30:04,559
 

1897
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,000
 teams or putting learning first is a

1898
00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:06,000
 

1899
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,520
 powerful thing and if you have to start

1900
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:07,520
 

1901
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,440
 there it's where you start

1902
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,440
 

1903
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,360
 a couple quick more small things here on

1904
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,360
 

1905
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,679
 what's different in the coaching space

1906
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:11,679
 

1907
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,640
 because

1908
00:30:11,669 --> 00:30:14,640
 

1909
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:16,320
 we get asked this all the time we put

1910
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:16,320
 

1911
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,039
 learning first in the dojo

1912
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:19,039
 

1913
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,799
 and so in stand-ups we don't do kind of

1914
00:30:19,029 --> 00:30:20,799
 

1915
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:22,559
 three questions

1916
00:30:20,789 --> 00:30:22,559
 

1917
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:24,000
 it's never individual it's not what did

1918
00:30:22,549 --> 00:30:24,000
 

1919
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,360
 you do today what are you going to do

1920
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,360
 

1921
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,320
 tomorrow or i'm sorry what'd you do

1922
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,320
 

1923
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,760
 yesterday what are you doing today

1924
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,760
 

1925
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,640
 what's blocking you

1926
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,640
 

1927
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,480
 uh it's hey as a group what did we learn

1928
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:32,480
 

1929
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,360
 yesterday what was interesting and did

1930
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,360
 

1931
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,039
 these learnings

1932
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,039
 

1933
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,640
 make us rethink about what we want to do

1934
00:30:35,029 --> 00:30:36,640
 

1935
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:39,440
 today it's us

1936
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:39,440
 

1937
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,840
 and we versus i and you and it's

1938
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:41,840
 

1939
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,880
 learnings over status

1940
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:44,880
 

1941
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,919
 the demos are never about here's all the

1942
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:45,919
 

1943
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,720
 stories we created

1944
00:30:45,909 --> 00:30:48,720
 

1945
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:50,000
 the story the demos are about here's the

1946
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,000
 

1947
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,600
 ideas we're playing with

1948
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,600
 

1949
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,120
 and we want to get feedback from you and

1950
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:53,120
 

1951
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,480
 we want to understand better if this is

1952
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,480
 

1953
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,000
 meeting your needs so the language of

1954
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:56,000
 

1955
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,320
 the demo changes

1956
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:58,320
 

1957
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,080
 retros are very small and test driven

1958
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:00,080
 

1959
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,320
 it's not just this was good i want to

1960
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:02,320
 

1961
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:04,799
 talk more we talk we actually say

1962
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:04,799
 

1963
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,559
 what do we expect to have what are the

1964
00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:06,559
 

1965
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,840
 expected outcomes from there any changes

1966
00:31:06,549 --> 00:31:07,840
 

1967
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:10,720
 we want to make

1968
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:10,720
 

1969
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,519
 they're fast and to the point continuous

1970
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:11,519
 

1971
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,559
 planning

1972
00:31:11,509 --> 00:31:14,559
 

1973
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:18,399
 very small uh planning sessions

1974
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:18,399
 

1975
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:21,200
 uh big horizon kind of but small focus

1976
00:31:18,389 --> 00:31:21,200
 

1977
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:22,080
 and we do things uh two sprints a week

1978
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:22,080
 

1979
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,799
 the two sprinters

1980
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:24,799
 

1981
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:27,039
 we two sprints a week thing is uh

1982
00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:27,039
 

1983
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:29,200
 there's a variety of reasons behind it

1984
00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:29,200
 

1985
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:30,720
 but the the simple the simplest reasons

1986
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,720
 

1987
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:35,360
 i can tell you is

1988
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:35,360
 

1989
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:38,640
 uh going to small cycles uh reduces

1990
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:38,640
 

1991
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,919
 the need to be right it

1992
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:39,919
 

1993
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,840
 kind of increases this ability of

1994
00:31:39,909 --> 00:31:41,840
 

1995
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,279
 psychological safety if i was wrong for

1996
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,279
 

1997
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,799
 two days it's not a big deal but i was

1998
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:44,799
 

1999
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,799
 wrong for two weeks i got to kind of lie

2000
00:31:44,789 --> 00:31:46,799
 

2001
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:48,480
 to show i wasn't wrong

2002
00:31:46,789 --> 00:31:48,480
 

2003
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,480
 and then a lot of the ceremonies just go

2004
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:50,480
 

2005
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,240
 away if

2006
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:52,240
 

2007
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,000
 if you want to estimate that's fine and

2008
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:54,000
 

2009
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,519
 estimating has its purpose

2010
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:55,519
 

2011
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,480
 but like if you're working in a two-day

2012
00:31:55,509 --> 00:31:58,480
 

2013
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:00,480
 sprint if something's a one or a three i

2014
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:00,480
 

2015
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,000
 i really don't care the question isn't

2016
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:02,000
 

2017
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,320
 how big is it the question is

2018
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:04,320
 

2019
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,919
 is it too big is this thing interesting

2020
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,919
 

2021
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,200
 yeah can we get it done in two days yeah

2022
00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:07,200
 

2023
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,760
 okay let's go do it

2024
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:09,760
 

2025
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,919
 it's not spend two hours talking about

2026
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,919
 

2027
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:14,399
 the if it's a five or a seven

2028
00:32:11,909 --> 00:32:14,399
 

2029
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:16,720
 it's just we get past the ceremony and

2030
00:32:14,389 --> 00:32:16,720
 

2031
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:18,399
 get to doing things

2032
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,399
 

2033
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,760
 so there you go starting your own dojo

2034
00:32:18,389 --> 00:32:19,760
 

2035
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:21,919
 get a set of practices

2036
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,919
 

2037
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,360
 tie it to outcomes and impacts if you

2038
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:23,360
 

2039
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,720
 have to just start with a team

2040
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,720
 

2041
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,200
 start with it you know start with a team

2042
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:27,200
 

2043
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:30,240
 go to their space you do need to have

2044
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:30,240
 

2045
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,760
 good uh coaches that put learning first

2046
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,760
 

2047
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,120
 and not a process first so

2048
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,120
 

2049
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,279
 you know look for those kinds of things

2050
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:35,279
 

2051
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:37,600
 inside your coaches

2052
00:32:35,269 --> 00:32:37,600
 

2053
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:39,039
 always embrace learning put it in

2054
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,039
 

2055
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,840
 context

2056
00:32:39,029 --> 00:32:40,840
 

2057
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:43,440
 make make it experience based make it

2058
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:43,440
 

2059
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:45,600
 social don't worry about transformation

2060
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,600
 

2061
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,440
 continuously experiment learn

2062
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:47,440
 

2063
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,240
 and evolve and you'll i guarantee you

2064
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:50,240
 

2065
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:53,200
 you'll have better outcomes

2066
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:53,200
 

2067
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,880
 i love deming as i'm sure many of you do

2068
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:54,880
 

2069
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,000
 all of your organizations already have

2070
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:56,000
 

2071
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,760
 wonderful people you

2073
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,600
 don't need big consultants to kind of

2074
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,600
 

2075
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,640
 come in and tell you what to how to do

2076
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,640
 

2077
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,240
 things

2078
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:02,240
 

2079
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,919
 you just need to let your people do

2080
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,919
 

2081
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,640
 things

2082
00:33:03,909 --> 00:33:06,640
 

2083
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:07,760
 give them the environment where the the

2084
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:07,760
 

2085
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,480
 their abilities

2086
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:10,480
 

2087
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,600
 is as valued and they can make a

2088
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:11,600
 

2089
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,919
 difference

2090
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,919
 

2091
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,120
 uh in their work and good things will

2092
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:15,120
 

2093
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,840
 happen a dojo

2094
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:17,840
 

2095
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:19,360
 has been in my experience a wonderful

2096
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,360
 

2097
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:22,880
 way of having that happen

2098
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:22,880
 

2099
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,240
 in many organizations there's blogs and

2100
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,240
 

2101
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,279
 podcasts those kinds of things

2102
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:27,279
 

2103
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,360
 um i wrote a book uh with my partner

2104
00:33:27,269 --> 00:33:29,360
 

2105
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:31,440
 more than happy to send out uh kindle

2117
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,399
 that made sense and and that uh helped

2118
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:44,399
 

2119
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,399

 what questions do you all have

2122
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:54,470
 

2123
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:02,080
 uh we have to

2124
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:02,080
 

2125
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:04,960
 join in uh as an audio nancy

2126
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:04,960
 

2127
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,960
 i will allow her

2128
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:05,190
 

2129
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:12,399
 okay so if she has any questions

2130
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:12,399
 

2131
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:15,119
 sure uh while she joins in

2132
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:15,119
 

2133
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:16,960
 uh there is a question do uh from sir

2134
00:34:15,109 --> 00:34:16,960
 

2135
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:20,000
 bajoy

2136
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:20,000
 

2137
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:23,520
 do dojos have backlogs and who tends to

2138
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:23,520
 

2139
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,399
 have ownership of what gets put in the

2140
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:26,399
 

2141
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,399
 in this backlogs

2142
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:26,710
 

2143
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,320
 that's a it's a wonderful question um so

2144
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:30,320
 

2145
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,040
 what we do

2146
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:33,040
 

2147
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,960
 with the teams uh like their first days

2148
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,960
 

2149
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,440
 is the team creates a backlog

2150
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:37,440
 

2151
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,280
 um i'll tell you that we tend to use

2152
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:39,280
 

2153
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,240
 more visual backlogs we tend to use

2154
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:40,240
 

2155
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,119
 story maps

2156
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:43,119
 

2157
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:44,800
 uh as opposed to uh like any tools or

2158
00:34:43,109 --> 00:34:44,800
 

2159
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,720
 linear backlogs

2160
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:46,720
 

2161
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,399
 but the team owns the backlog the team

2162
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,399
 

2163
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,000
 in the dojo um

2164
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:50,000
 

2165
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:51,919
 and the the way and so usually when

2166
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:51,919
 

2167
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,159
 teams come into the dojo

2168
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:54,159
 

2169
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:55,760
 the the product owner comes in or

2170
00:34:54,149 --> 00:34:55,760
 

2171
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,560
 somebody with product domain experience

2172
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:56,560
 

2173
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,160
 comes in and

2174
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:58,160
 

2175
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,800
 they're there with the experience as

2176
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:00,800
 

2177
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,560
 well but what's interesting is we use

2178
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:02,560
 

2179
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,560
 visual story maps those kinds of things

2180
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:04,560
 

2181
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:07,040
 for the backlog and we just do

2182
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:07,040
 

2183
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,560
 uh like almost like swim lanes here's

2184
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:08,560
 

2185
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,079
 where we're focusing on now here's

2186
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:10,079
 

2187
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,000
 what's next here's what's later

2188
00:35:10,069 --> 00:35:12,000
 

2189
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:13,920
 and then as the team learns new things

2190
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:13,920
 

2191
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,440
 they're continuously evolving the map

2192
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:15,440
 

2193
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,760
 and so it's just interesting because you

2194
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:17,760
 

2195
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,440
 can see the knowledge of the product

2196
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,440
 

2197
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,520
 change over time just by seeing the

2198
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:21,520
 

2199
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,000
 visualization of the map change

2200
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:24,000
 

2201
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,040
 um but anyway yes there is a backlog the

2202
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,040
 

2203
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,079
 team owns it

2204
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:28,079
 

2205
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:31,119
 uh the things that get put in there um

2206
00:35:28,069 --> 00:35:31,119
 

2207
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,000
 is product work now sometimes the

2208
00:35:31,109 --> 00:35:32,000
 

2209
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,800
 product work

2210
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:34,800
 

2211
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,280
 might say things like um to make this

2212
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:35,280
 

2213
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,800
 thing work

2214
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:36,800
 

2215
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,480
 effectively we need to get it deployed

2216
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:38,480
 

2217
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,760
 into a kubernetes pod and so we kind of

2218
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,760
 

2219
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,000
 get a little sticky on there

2220
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:42,000
 

2221
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,240
 and we'll kind of color code things but

2222
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:44,240
 

2223
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,160
 it's one fundamental backlog of all the

2224
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:46,160
 

2225
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:50,240
 ideas

2226
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:50,240
 

2227
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:54,720
 good question ramesh once

2228
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:54,720
 

2229
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:54,720
 allowed for this question sure

2230
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:56,310
 

2231
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,480
 naresh you uh you can speak

2232
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:03,750
 

2233
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,200
 while he is able to speak there is

2234
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:07,200
 

2235
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,839
 another question

2236
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:10,839
 

2237
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:12,240
 from idris what is the ideal size of the

2238
00:36:10,829 --> 00:36:12,240
 

2239
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:14,160
 group

2240
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:14,160
 

2241
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,520
 so i've i'll i'll give you a couple of

2242
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,520
 

2243
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,880
 answers to that question i've

2244
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:18,880
 

2245
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:22,560
 worked with groups uh as small as three

2246
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:22,560
 

2247
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:26,800
 uh and the largest team i've worked with

2248
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:26,800
 

2249
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:29,680
 a singular team uh is probably about 10.

2250
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:29,680
 

2251
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,400
 um and so both of those worked fine i'll

2252
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,400
 

2253
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:34,000
 tell you though

2254
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:34,000
 

2255
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:36,720
 that i have had teams of 50

2256
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:36,720
 

2257
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,839
 uh come into a dojo even teams of 80

2258
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:37,839
 

2259
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,320
 come into a dojo

2260
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:40,320
 

2261
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:42,000
 and then what happened was in both of

2262
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:42,000
 

2263
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:45,040
 those experiences

2264
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:45,040
 

2265
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,760
 we actually were experimenting with what

2266
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:45,760
 

2267
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,920
 is the right

2268
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,920
 

2269
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,880
 subdivision of teams of a group that

2270
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:48,880
 

2271
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,040
 large

2272
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:51,040
 

2273
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,800
 um and so we so that's how we would do

2274
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,800
 

2275
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,200
 things the team had a common goal they

2276
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:55,200
 

2277
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,040
 had a big product they were working on

2278
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:57,040
 

2279
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,480
 that when they came in they came in by

2280
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:58,480
 

2281
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,000
 reporting structure

2282
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:00,000
 

2283
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,160
 but you all know that reporting

2284
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:02,160
 

2285
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,760
 structure and how products get created

2286
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,760
 

2287
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,359
 usually aren't the same

2288
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:05,359
 

2289
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,800
 and so we just laid it out hey we're

2290
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:06,800
 

2291
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:08,000
 going to do a lot of experiments around

2292
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:08,000
 

2293
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,800
 what's the most effective

2294
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:10,800
 

2295
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,160
 team structure that would work uh and so

2296
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:12,160
 

2297
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,280
 we did that we experiment with that

2298
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,280
 

2299
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:16,400
 while we taught things

2300
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:16,400
 

2301
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,079
 um so i've had all to say i've had teams

2302
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:18,079
 

2303
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,760
 come in as 50 or 80

2304
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,760
 

2305
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:21,359
 that we would then decompose into

2306
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:21,359
 

2307
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,880
 smaller teams and then work with teams

2308
00:37:21,349 --> 00:37:22,880
 

2309
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:26,240
 around town

2310
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:26,240
 

2311
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,920
 uh so the next question is from john he

2312
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,920
 

2313
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,920
 is asking if the slides would be

2314
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:29,920
 

2315
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,400
 available are you going to post those

2316
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:30,400
 

2317
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,440
 sites

2318
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:33,440
 

2319
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,440
 uh slide somewhere

2320
00:37:33,589 --> 00:37:33,589
 

2321
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:39,520
 yeah uh they'll be uh on my the

2322
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:39,520
 

2323
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,800
 i can on this on our site there they'll

2324
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,800
 

2325
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,480
 be there and i'll send them to the

2326
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:42,480
 

2327
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,040
 toronto azure community however they

2328
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:43,040
 

2329
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,119
 post them

2330
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:45,119
 

2331
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:47,040
 uh they'll be available too so next

2332
00:37:45,109 --> 00:37:47,040
 

2333
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:49,920
 question is from jennifer

2334
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:49,920
 

2335
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,720
 how do you get the organization to agree

2336
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:50,720
 

2337
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,839
 to create

2338
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:53,839
 

2339
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:57,280
 a dojo to approach a new project

2340
00:37:53,829 --> 00:37:57,280
 

2341
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:59,119
 if management has not seen any track

2342
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:59,119
 

2343
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,400
 record

2344
00:37:59,109 --> 00:38:00,400
 

2345
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,160
 that is how do you get to the

2346
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:02,160
 

2347
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,680
 organization to get over its

2348
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:05,680
 

2349
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:07,440
 doubts or fears

2350
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:07,440
 

2351
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,960
 uh it's again it's a great question and

2352
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:08,960
 

2353
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,320
 one i i deal with

2354
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:10,320
 

2355
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,160
 uh i shouldn't say deal with the one

2356
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:12,160
 

2357
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:15,760
 that i get asked frequently

2358
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:15,760
 

2359
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:18,480
 um i i never suggest

2360
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:18,480
 

2361
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,280
 any organization should say dojo is a

2362
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:19,280
 

2363
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,680
 great idea

2364
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:21,680
 

2365
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,560
 let's go spend a million dollars on it i

2366
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:22,560
 

2367
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,680
 i don't think

2368
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,680
 

2369
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:27,839
 that's a reasonable or responsible ask

2370
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,839
 

2371
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:31,040
 usually and the way we approach things

2372
00:38:27,829 --> 00:38:31,040
 

2373
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:31,040
 is we'll say

2374
00:38:31,589 --> 00:38:31,589
 

2375
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:35,680
 let's let's pilot this with a couple

2376
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:35,680
 

2377
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,480
 teams maybe it's one team maybe it's two

2378
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:36,480
 

2379
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,240
 teams

2380
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:38,240
 

2381
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,560
 uh and it's definitely never more than

2382
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:40,560
 

2383
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:44,079
 three it's never more than three teams

2384
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:44,079
 

2385
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:46,880
 but what happens is um

2386
00:38:44,069 --> 00:38:46,880
 

2387
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:48,560
 as we uh pilot with the first team you

2388
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:48,560
 

2389
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,160
 start learning things that the dojo

2390
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:50,160
 

2391
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,000
 might have to change before it would

2392
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:52,000
 

2393
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,320
 actually be beneficial for other teams

2394
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:54,320
 

2395
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,599
 so maybe it's things around uh how

2396
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:55,599
 

2397
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,119
 you're marketing it or how you're

2398
00:38:55,589 --> 00:38:57,119
 

2399
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:59,040
 advertising it or

2400
00:38:57,109 --> 00:38:59,040
 

2401
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:01,119
 what the what the techniques actually

2402
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:01,119
 

2403
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,560
 are or how you're talking to people or

2404
00:39:01,109 --> 00:39:02,560
 

2405
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:06,320
 how you're structuring teams

2406
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:06,320
 

2407
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:08,240
 so uh i would never suggest a

2408
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:08,240
 

2409
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,800
 organization kind of go all in i would

2410
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:10,800
 

2411
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,920
 say let's experiment with one team let's

2412
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:11,920
 

2413
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,760
 explain more through teams

2414
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:13,760
 

2415
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,960
 and then after that let's pause and

2416
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:14,960
 

2417
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,560
 let's make sure that

2418
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:16,560
 

2419
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,240
 we're getting the outcomes that we

2420
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:18,240
 

2421
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,119
 wanted to get from the from the

2422
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,119
 

2423
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,040
 learnings

2424
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:21,040
 

2425
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,560
 now i can tell you what usually happens

2426
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,560
 

2427
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,079
 in those first two is you start learning

2428
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:24,079
 

2429
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,079
 organizational kind of

2430
00:39:24,069 --> 00:39:26,079
 

2431
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,599
 challenges and then you get to say

2432
00:39:26,069 --> 00:39:27,599
 

2433
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:29,839
 before we do anything else what do you

2434
00:39:27,589 --> 00:39:29,839
 

2435
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,520
 want to do about these big things right

2436
00:39:29,829 --> 00:39:31,520
 

2437
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:33,200
 these people can't access this these

2438
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,200
 

2439
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,800
 people can't do this the project the

2440
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,800
 

2441
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,599
 product owner really never wants to talk

2442
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:35,599
 

2443
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,440
 to anybody

2444
00:39:35,589 --> 00:39:37,440
 

2445
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,800
 so these aren't these aren't dojo

2446
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:38,800
 

2447
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,400
 problems these are organizational

2448
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:40,400
 

2449
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,400
 problems so then we start exposing

2450
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:42,400
 

2451
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,000
 things and working it that way

2452
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:44,000
 

2453
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,599
 hopefully hopefully that helped so we

2454
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:45,599
 

2455
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,880
 have two more questions and we are all

2456
00:39:45,589 --> 00:39:46,880
 

2457
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:50,000
 ready to make it

2458
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:50,000
 

2459
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:53,440
 uh ahead of our time uh

2460
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:53,440
 

2461
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,599
 oh sure okay so um the next question is

2462
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:55,599
 

2463
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,160
 can you share an experience if possible

2464
00:39:55,589 --> 00:39:56,160
 

2465
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:58,240
 when

2466
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:58,240
 

2467
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,280
 where you learned an organizational

2468
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,280
 

2469
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,280
 constraint

2470
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:01,280
 

2471
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,640
 due to segregation of duties or

2472
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,640
 

2473
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,880
 departments

2474
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:04,880
 

2475
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,680
 and how that was at risk to leadership

2476
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:05,680
 

2477
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,040
 to change

2478
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:09,040
 

2479
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:12,160
 that or evolve from that

2480
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:12,160
 

2481
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,880
 oh sure that's a great question um i i

2482
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:12,880
 

2483
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,119
 had a group

2484
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:15,119
 

2485
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,200
 uh this might not seem too unfamiliar to

2486
00:40:15,109 --> 00:40:17,200
 

2487
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,400
 people uh an organization that had a

2488
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:18,400
 

2489
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:21,599
 devops team

2490
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:21,599
 

2491
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,040
 right uh so they were everybody's trying

2492
00:40:21,589 --> 00:40:23,040
 

2493
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,839
 to go to the cloud and be faster at

2494
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:23,839
 

2495
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,599
 delivery but

2496
00:40:23,829 --> 00:40:25,599
 

2497
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:27,760
 everybody had to go through the devops

2498
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,760
 

2499
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:29,119
 team and the devops team was growing so

2500
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:29,119
 

2501
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,680
 fast because they couldn't keep up with

2502
00:40:29,109 --> 00:40:29,680
 

2503
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:32,880
 demand

2504
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:32,880
 

2505
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:34,640
 they they had all the keys to azure uh

2506
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:34,640
 

2507
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,160
 anybody that wanted to deploy they had

2508
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:36,160
 

2509
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,599
 to do a consult with them

2510
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,599
 

2511
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,839
 right and so you can see how this plays

2512
00:40:37,589 --> 00:40:39,839
 

2513
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:41,440
 out and it creates long queues and all

2514
00:40:39,829 --> 00:40:41,440
 

2515
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:44,640
 these type of situations

2516
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:44,640
 

2517
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,400
 um and so that that's a fundamentally a

2518
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:46,400
 

2519
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,240
 problem and so we brought that team in

2520
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:48,240
 

2521
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,680
 because that team was stressed and so

2522
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:49,680
 

2523
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,760
 when we brought that team in

2524
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:51,760
 

2525
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,880
 we it wasn't about you're bad you

2526
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:52,880
 

2527
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,440
 shouldn't do these things

2528
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:55,440
 

2529
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,960
 the team said we want to make it easier

2530
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:56,960
 

2531
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,560
 for other people to do this

2532
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:58,560
 

2533
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,079
 now we can't give up all the rains

2534
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:00,079
 

2535
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,440
 because we don't want things to cost too

2536
00:41:00,069 --> 00:41:01,440
 

2537
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,520
 much and that's a different problem

2538
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:03,520
 

2539
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,040
 but the team the actual engineers in the

2540
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:05,040
 

2541
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,400
 cloud group actually started and said

2542
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,400
 

2543
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,760
 what we created a little bit automation

2544
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:07,760
 

2545
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,960
 let's see what happens

2546
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:08,960
 

2547
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,800
 and so we did that and then people

2548
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:10,800
 

2549
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,560
 started using it and then we took that

2550
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:12,560
 

2551
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,119
 information to the leadership and said

2552
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:13,119
 

2553
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,839
 look

2554
00:41:13,109 --> 00:41:15,839
 

2555
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:17,680
 right now you have peep teams waiting

2556
00:41:15,829 --> 00:41:17,680
 

2557
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:19,359
 six months to get to the cloud

2558
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:19,359
 

2559
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,200
 we did this little piece of automation

2560
00:41:19,349 --> 00:41:21,200
 

2561
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:23,280
 and it only works in the dev environment

2562
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:23,280
 

2563
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:25,599
 but now people are able to stop

2564
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:25,599
 

2565
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,800
 going through your devops team and able

2566
00:41:25,589 --> 00:41:26,800
 

2567
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,920
 to do it on their own

2568
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:29,920
 

2569
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:32,960
 and the world didn't care and so so

2570
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:32,960
 

2571
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,359
 it's these very small things uh that you

2572
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:33,359
 

2573
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,040
 start

2574
00:41:33,349 --> 00:41:35,040
 

2575
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:36,400
 bringing up data points to or to

2576
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,400
 

2577
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,599
 leadership where you're saying like look

2578
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:37,599
 

2579
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,280
 you have teams queuing up and it's

2580
00:41:37,589 --> 00:41:39,280
 

2581
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:41,920
 costing you an absurd amount of money

2582
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:41,920
 

2583
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:44,000
 we're doing these little things uh so

2584
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:44,000
 

2585
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,280
 obviously this silo isn't a good idea

2586
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:45,280
 

2587
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,200
 and then they start realizing and you

2588
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:47,200
 

2589
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,520
 have data to back it up um so that's

2590
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:47,520
 

2591
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,000
 that

2592
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:50,000
 

2593
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:53,040
 that happened back back in march of this

2594
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:53,040
 

2595
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,040
 year right before coveted

2596
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:54,550
 

2597
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,920
 so the uh let's take the last question

2598
00:41:57,349 --> 00:41:57,920
 

2599
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:00,720
 uh

2600
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:00,720
 

2601
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,079
 what was the leadership management

2602
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:02,079
 

2603
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:05,440
 buy-in experience when

2604
00:42:02,069 --> 00:42:05,440
 

2605
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:06,960
 introducing the idea of dojo any hurdles

2606
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:06,960
 

2607
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:12,400
 and maybe the last question

2608
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:12,400
 

2609
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:12,400
 who and what and who triggers a dojo

2610
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:13,910
 

2611
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,839
 okay uh yeah monkey monkey so the what

2612
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,839
 

2613
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,760
 in the who usually there's some kind of

2614
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:19,760
 

2615
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:21,839
 person inside of an organization

2616
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:21,839
 

2617
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,359
 um that's look that's in charge of a

2618
00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:23,359
 

2619
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,640
 digital transformation that's the that's

2620
00:42:23,349 --> 00:42:24,640
 

2621
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:26,000
 the kind of easy answer there's

2622
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:26,000
 

2623
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,319
 there's somebody a high enough level

2624
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:28,319
 

2625
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,640
 that says we need to change

2626
00:42:28,309 --> 00:42:30,640
 

2627
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:32,000
 um the things that have triggered it

2628
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:32,000
 

2629
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:35,200
 have usually

2630
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:35,200
 

2631
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,960
 uh been market events um

2632
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,960
 

2633
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:39,599
 so it could be something as substantial

2634
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:39,599
 

2635
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,760
 as a large company saying

2636
00:42:39,589 --> 00:42:41,760
 

2637
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,880
 uh if we don't get better we're gonna

2638
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:42,880
 

2639
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,400
 get bought or we're not gonna be a

2640
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:44,400
 

2641
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,760
 company anymore um

2642
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:47,760
 

2643
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,640
 or it could be like uh without naming

2644
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:48,640
 

2645
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,240
 too many names

2646
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:52,240
 

2647
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:54,079
 um tesla and spacex they're doing a lot

2648
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:54,079
 

2649
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,960
 of things that are making

2650
00:42:54,069 --> 00:42:56,960
 

2651
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:58,000
 uh old-school companies rethink how they

2652
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:58,000
 

2653
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,599
 do things and

2654
00:42:57,990 --> 00:42:59,599
 

2655
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,440
 realize that if they don't change the

2656
00:42:59,589 --> 00:43:01,440
 

2657
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:03,440
 way that they fundamentally

2658
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:03,440
 

2659
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,800
 think about delivery they won't be

2660
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:04,800
 

2661
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,599
 around so the

2662
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:07,599
 

2663
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,800
 these triggers are usually market events

2664
00:43:07,589 --> 00:43:08,800
 

2665
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:11,040
 where

2666
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:11,040
 

2667
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,319
 high level executives realize that

2668
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:12,319
 

2669
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:15,599
 they're not going to be getting paid so

2670
00:43:12,309 --> 00:43:15,599
 

2671
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:18,800
 well very soon if things don't change

2672
00:43:15,589 --> 00:43:18,800
 

2673
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:20,480
 that being said uh usually the

2674
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:20,480
 

2675
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,920
 executives and leadership get excited

2676
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:21,920
 

2677
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,480
 about these things about bringing them

2678
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:22,480
 

2679
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,720
 in

2680
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:26,720
 

2681
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:28,400
 the biggest hurdle is usually

2682
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:28,400
 

2683
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,880
 is the middle management or the

2684
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:30,880
 

2685
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,800
 executives once you get with teams

2686
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:32,800
 

2687
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,560
 and teams understand that you're

2688
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:34,560
 

2689
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,880
 fundamentally there to help

2690
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:36,880
 

2691
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,920
 and make their work easier they get

2692
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:37,920
 

2693
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,319
 excited and that's

2694
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:40,319
 

2695
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,839
 that's good that's easy work the

2696
00:43:40,309 --> 00:43:41,839
 

2697
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:43,520
 challenge becomes in that double loop

2698
00:43:41,829 --> 00:43:43,520
 

2699
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:46,160
 learning when all of a sudden

2700
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:46,160
 

2701
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:48,240
 the people that brought you in uh now

2702
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:48,240
 

2703
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:50,000
 realize that they have things to learn

2704
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:50,000
 

2705
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,880
 and that's the hard part and so we've

2706
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:52,880
 

2707
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,160
 done uh leadership dojos where it's like

2708
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:54,160
 

2709
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,839
 look we're going to get the executives

2710
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:55,839
 

2711
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:57,200
 together now we don't do it for six

2712
00:43:55,829 --> 00:43:57,200
 

2713
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:59,280
 weeks because

2714
00:43:57,190 --> 00:43:59,280
 

2715
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,880
 they'll never do it but fundamentally

2716
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:00,880
 

2717
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,800
 getting them together to go through an

2718
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:02,800
 

2719
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,760
 experience and understand how the work

2720
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:03,760
 

2721
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,440
 works

2722
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:05,440
 

2723
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,880
 that has opened up so many eyes of

2724
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:06,880
 

2725
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,720
 executives because they just get

2726
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:08,720
 

2727
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,040
 disconnected uh from how

2728
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:11,040
 

2729
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,839
 from the reality of how work works and

2730
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:11,839
 

2731
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,839
 so

2732
00:44:11,829 --> 00:44:13,839
 

2733
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:15,440
 the biggest can hurdle is usually at the

2734
00:44:13,829 --> 00:44:15,440
 

2735
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:17,599
 the middle level or above

2736
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:17,599
 

2737
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,440
 uh and we we address it by doing

2738
00:44:17,589 --> 00:44:19,440
 

2739
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:19,839
 experiences for helping them rethink

2740
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:19,839
 

2741
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,920
 things

2742
00:44:19,829 --> 00:44:21,920
 

2743
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:23,760
 talking value demand failure demand

2744
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:23,760
 

2745
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,839
 systems thinking to executives

2746
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:25,839
 

2747
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,599
 having them understand kind of good

2748
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,599
 

2749
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:28,800
 metrics versus kind of nonsensical

2750
00:44:27,589 --> 00:44:28,800
 

2751
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:32,160
 metrics

2752
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:32,160
 

2753
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,160
 all those things make the difference

2754
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:33,510
 

2755
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:41,760
 i think we're drastically over time

2756
00:44:37,589 --> 00:44:41,760
 

2757
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:43,839
 our overtime so uh uh

2758
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:43,839
 

2759
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,200
 david has posted the slides as well on

2760
00:44:43,829 --> 00:44:45,200
 

2761
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:48,720
 the chat so

2762
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:48,720
 

2763
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:52,480
 yeah thank you david i appreciate it

2764
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:52,480
 

2765
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:54,880
 yeah we are done with this session any

2766
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:54,880
 

2767
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,880
 maybe
