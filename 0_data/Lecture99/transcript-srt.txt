 and as we'll see in his talk today these

48
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,590
 

49
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:39,310
 things can offer inspiration for new

50
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,310

65
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,560
 and that was for his work on molecular

66
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,560
 

67
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:59,180

00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,620
 

79
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,360
 very excited to hear about his work

80
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,360
 

81
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:14,860
 today so please join me in welcoming

82
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,860
 

83
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,860
 professor Michael Levin

84
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:19,560
 

85
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:24,410
 thank you so much and I'm really excited

86
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,410
 

87
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:27,110
 to be able to present this work to a new

88
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,110
 

89
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:29,360
 audience and I'm gonna give you the main

90
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,360
 

91
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:31,010
 message of my talk right up front what I

92
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,010
 

93
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,080
 would like to tell you about is that

94
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,080
 

95
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:35,300
 biology has been computing at many

96
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,300
 

97
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,520
 scales long before brains came on the

98
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,520
 

99
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:40,070
 scene and then actually decision-making

100
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:40,070
 

101
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,380
 and all body tissues are mediated by an

102
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,380
 

103
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:44,240
 ancient pre neural electrical network

104
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,240
 

105
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:46,550
 that is made up of all cells not just

106
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,550
 

107
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,860
 neurons and so I think that exploiting

108
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,860
 

109
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:50,750
 this kind of non neural cognition is an

110
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,750
 

111
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,190
 exciting untapped frontier for the

112
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,190
 

113
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,930
 development of new robust AI

114
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,930
 

115
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:55,070
 technologies and I'm very interested in

116
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,070
 

117
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:57,320
 talking to people about these

118
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,320
 

119
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:58,669
 possibilities we're looking for experts

120
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,669
 

121
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,470
 in machine learning to collaborate with

122
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:00,470
 

123
00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:02,450
 us to take dielectrics beyond

124
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,450
 

125
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:04,820
 regenerative medicine and towards many

126
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,820
 

127
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:06,020
 new exciting applications so the first

128
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,020
 

129
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,900
 thing I would like to do is talk to you

130
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,900
 

131
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:12,350
 a little bit about brain body plasticity

132
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:12,350
 

133
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:13,910
 - and then to bring to you some examples

134
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,910
 

135
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,910
 of somatic cognition in the body

136
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,910
 

137
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:19,760
 decision-making during the self editing

138
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,760
 

139
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:21,350
 of complex anatomies and then we'll talk

140
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,350
 

141
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,060
 about bioelectric mechanisms that

142
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,060
 

143
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:25,550
 underlie the ability of cells and

144
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,550
 

145
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:27,530
 tissues to remodel towards large scale

146
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,530
 

147
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:29,120
 goals and then I'll talk about the what

148
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,120
 

149
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:32,840
 I think is the future of regenerative

150
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,840
 

151
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,960
 medicine and an AI and related issues so

152
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,960
 

153
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,780
 let's talk about plasticity caterpillar

154
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,780
 

155
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,820
 start out life as a soft body robot that

156
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,820
 

157
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:43,070
 crawls and choose plants during

158
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:43,070
 

159
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,570
 metamorphosis its nervous system and

160
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,570
 

161
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,550
 including its brain is basically

162
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,550
 

163
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,740
 liquefied it's taken apart and then

164
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,740
 

165
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:51,440
 reassembled into a completely different

166
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:51,440
 

167
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:53,930
 brain that is able to run a hard robot

168
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,930
 

169
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,910
 which flies and drinks nectar during

170
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,910
 

171
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:58,310
 this process of complete nervous system

172
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,310
 

173
00:06:55,910 --> 00:07:00,320
 take up tape being taken apart and

174
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,320
 

175
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:02,360
 putting back together the memories in

176
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,360
 

177
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,430
 fact remain so things that the butter

178
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,430
 

179
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,020
 that the caterpillar has learned the

180
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,020
 

181
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:07,250
 butterfly will still remember and this

182
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,250
 

183
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:09,139
 has been this has been as well

184
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,139
 

185
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:11,450
 established and so it's very interesting

186
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:11,450
 

187
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:13,669
 to be to start to think about how it is

188
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,669
 

189
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:15,080
 that information can be stored in the

190
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:15,080
 

191
00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:18,200
 medium that is undergoing radical

192
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:18,200
 

193
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:20,389
 deformation in work that we've done a

194
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:20,389
 

195
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,950
 few years ago we show that planaria

196
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:21,950
 

197
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:23,780
 these are the flatworms that you see

198
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,780
 

199
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:25,340
 here they have this amazing property

200
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,340
 

201
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:27,110
 that if you cut off their head or in

202
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:27,110
 

203
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,849
 fact any part of their body they will

204
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,849
 

205
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:30,860
 regenerate it they regrow their brain

206
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,860
 

207
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:32,030
 and all the other organs so if you train

208
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,030
 

209
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,430
 a flatworm to wreck

210
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,430
 

211
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:36,320
 a particular location as being its home

212
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,320
 

213
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:38,480
 environment and then you amputate the

214
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,480
 

215
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,430
 brain you leave the tail and let it

216
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,430
 

217
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,290
 regenerate a new head here what you

218
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,290
 

219
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:44,420
 discover is that again these these

220
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,420
 

221
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:46,970
 memories are intact so the memory of

222
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,970
 

223
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:49,250
 this in this animal is in some way

224
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,250
 

225
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:51,560
 imprinted on the new brain that develops

226
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,560
 

227
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:54,050
 after regeneration and it challenges us

228
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:54,050
 

229
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:57,890
 to try to understand how encoding and

230
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,890
 

231
00:07:54,050 --> 00:08:00,790
 decoding of complex complex memories and

232
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,790
 

233
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:02,840
 learned behaviors for is able to be

234
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,840
 

235
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:04,790
 propagated across this kind of radical

236
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,790
 

237
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,590
 reconstruction of the of the memory

238
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,590
 

239
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:07,940
 medium and in fact when we published

240
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,940
 

241
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:09,920
 this a few years ago actually we weren't

242
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,920
 

243
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:12,380
 the ones to discover this this was first

244
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:12,380
 

245
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,900
 discovered by a guy named McConnell in

246
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,900
 

247
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:16,490
 the 60s but we people hadn't really

248
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,490
 

249
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,080
 looked at this for years and people got

250
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,080
 

251
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:20,270
 pretty excited as you can see here I'm

252
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,270
 

253
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,160
 on the internet when we've when we first

254
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,160
 

255
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:25,760
 showed that this that this was possible

256
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:25,760
 

257
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:28,840
 and going beyond the sort of brain body

258
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,840
 

259
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:31,220
 interface and the question of how the

260
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:31,220
 

261
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,020
 programs of the of the behavioral

262
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,020
 

263
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:35,150
 programs of the brain interact with the

264
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,150
 

265
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:37,460
 structures of the body I want to talk to

266
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,460
 

267
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:40,400
 you about this kind of self editing of

268
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,400
 

269
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:43,250
 anatomy there are many different types

270
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:43,250
 

271
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:45,410
 of cognition from from very simple ones

272
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,410
 

273
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:47,600
 to all the way through the kinds of

274
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,600
 

275
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:49,130
 complex things that we hope to mimic

276
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,130
 

277
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,680
 with machine learning and artificial

278
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,680
 

279
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:54,290
 intelligence and there are all sorts of

280
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,290
 

281
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,930
 living creatures that are able to

282
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,930
 

283
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:59,930
 perform functions that are at various

284
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,930
 

285
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:02,360
 places on this ladder of cognition so

286
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,360
 

287
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:03,740
 one example for is here shown by this

288
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,740
 

289
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,870
 unicellular creature called the

290
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,870
 

291
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:07,550
 lacrimarum if you're interested in soft

292
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,550
 

293
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:11,360
 body robotics take a look at this this

294
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:11,360
 

295
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:13,670
 is a single cell okay and this organism

296
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,670
 

297
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,170
 handles its physiology its patterning

298
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,170
 

299
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:16,910
 look at the incredible control it has

300
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,910
 

301
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:19,370
 this is real time by the way this is not

302
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,370
 

303
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:21,940
 sped up so look at the amazing control

304
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,940
 

305
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:24,500
 that this has over its structure as it

306
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,500
 

307
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:25,970
 collects bacteria and as it's basically

308
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:25,970
 

309
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,520
 hunting and eating at the different

310
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,520
 

311
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:31,100
 other microorganisms in this environment

312
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:31,100
 

313
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:33,230
 but behavior structural control and

314
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:33,230
 

315
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:35,330
 physiology all in one cell there is no

316
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,330
 

317
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:38,240
 brain here as such and so unicellular

318
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,240
 

319
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:40,610
 organisms and single cells can be

320
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:40,610
 

321
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:44,660
 incredibly competent at all sorts of

322
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,660
 

323
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:45,560
 interesting goals now when cells joined

324
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:45,560
 

325
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:48,050
 to become

326
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:48,050
 

327
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:50,029
 multicellular bodies complex anatomical

328
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,029
 

329
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:52,010
 structures they did not lose this

330
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:52,010
 

331
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:53,600
 ability to make decisions and to have

332
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,600
 

333
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:55,610
 complex behaviors what you're seeing

334
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,610
 

335
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,560
 here on the left is a frog embryo

336
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,560
 

337
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:59,870
 developing and so these cells cooperate

338
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,870
 

339
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,940
 to build a very complex structure on the

340
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,940
 

341
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:04,279
 right you're seeing the development of a

342
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,279
 

343
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:06,470
 nervous system in zebrafish and so all

344
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:06,470
 

345
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:08,960
 of these cells are now working together

346
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,960
 

347
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:11,060
 to build a structure that's much larger

348
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,060
 

349
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:13,940
 than the single cell boundary of their

350
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,940
 

351
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,990
 immediate surface and we need to

352
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:14,990
 

353
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:17,810
 understand how this works

354
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,810
 

355
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:20,830
 all of us started life as a single cell

356
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,830
 

357
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:23,420
 a single fertilized egg and through this

358
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,420
 

359
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:26,300
 process of embryonic development these

360
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:26,300
 

361
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:28,190
 complex forms are able to be reliably

362
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,190
 

363
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:30,950
 generated so all of these remarkable

364
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,950
 

365
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:32,240
 complex anatomies and it's very

366
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,240
 

367
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:34,010
 important that we understand that this

368
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,010
 

369
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,529
 is not just a process that's going to be

370
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,529
 

371
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:38,960
 solved by stem cell biology because stem

372
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:38,960
 

373
00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:41,029
 cells are able to generate all of the

374
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:41,029
 

375
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,470
 individual tissues that are needed

376
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:42,470
 

377
00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:44,060
 foreign organisms of what you see here

378
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,060
 

379
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:46,970
 there's something called the teratoma

380
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:46,970
 

381
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:49,910
 this is a tumor that has hair and teeth

382
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,910
 

383
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:51,980
 and skin and muscle and so all of the

384
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,980
 

385
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:53,510
 stem cell differentiation has gone okay

386
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,510
 

387
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:55,850
 but what's missing is the large-scale

388
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,850
 

389
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:57,500
 3-dimensional structure so one of the

390
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,500
 

391
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:59,360
 important things we need to understand

392
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,360
 

393
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,640
 is how do cells decide what they're

394
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,640
 

395
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,920
 going to build and how do they implement

396
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,920
 

397
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:07,190
 that construction and so the sort of

398
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:07,190
 

399
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,630
 standard story that people are taught in

400
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,630
 

401
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:09,950
 developmental biology is that there's

402
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,950
 

403
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:12,320
 this kind of open-loop feed-forward

404
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,320
 

405
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:14,690
 system where gene regulatory networks

406
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:14,690
 

407
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,100
 give rise to proteins and then through

408
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,100
 

409
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:17,800
 some physics when these proteins

410
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:17,800
 

411
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,880
 interact with each other in the cells

412
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,880
 

413
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:22,040
 perform various functions there's this

414
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,040
 

415
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:24,500
 emergent process that give rise to

416
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,500
 

417
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:26,510
 complex Anatomy but it's actually much

418
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,510
 

419
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:30,380
 more interesting than that first of all

420
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,380
 

421
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:33,650
 all kinds of embryonic species are

422
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:33,650
 

423
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:35,330
 highly have highly regulated development

424
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,330
 

425
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:37,520
 in the sense that if there's a massive

426
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,520
 

427
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:39,680
 perturbation they can make up for it so

428
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,680
 

429
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,959
 for example here is an early mammalian

430
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,959
 

431
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,029
 embryo you can cut it in half and each

432
00:11:41,949 --> 00:11:44,029
 

433
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:45,470
 half will rebuild the other missing half

434
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:45,470
 

435
00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:47,810
 this is how you get perfectly normal

436
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,810
 

437
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:50,150
 monozygotic twins the opposite is

438
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,150
 

439
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:51,740
 possible too you can take two mammalian

440
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,740
 

441
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:53,480
 embryos mush them together like a

442
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,480
 

443
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:55,490
 snowball here these mouse embryos and

444
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,490
 

445
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,959
 what you get is a perfectly normal Mouse

446
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,959
 

447
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:58,490
 we would love to have technology

448
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:58,490
 

449
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,270
 obviously that has this degree of

450
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,270
 

451
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,920
 plasticity

452
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,920
 

453
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:03,740
 that can make up for such radical

454
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:03,740
 

455
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:05,990
 deformations now this is not only an

456
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,990
 

457
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:08,060
 embryonic phenomenon the process of

458
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,060
 

459
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:10,910
 regeneration such as the salamanders

460
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,910
 

461
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,530
 have is able to rebuild complex large

462
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,530
 

463
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:14,900
 structures during adulthood

464
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,900
 

465
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:17,390
 so here's an axolotl a salamander that

466
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:17,390
 

467
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:19,940
 can regenerate its eyes its jaws its

468
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,940
 

469
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:21,980
 limbs its spinal cord its ovaries and

470
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:21,980
 

471
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:24,260
 portions of the brain so as an adult

472
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:24,260
 

473
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:26,270
 this thing can rebuild very complex

474
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,270
 

475
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:28,400
 structures throughout its life the most

476
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,400
 

477
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:30,170
 amazing thing about regeneration is not

478
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,170
 

479
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,030
 that it's able to start it's that it

480
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,030
 

481
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:34,210
 knows when to stop all of these

482
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,210
 

483
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:35,870
 structures after the correct anatomical

484
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,870
 

485
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:37,910
 component has been rebuilt

486
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,910
 

487
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:39,860
 then further growth and remodeling

488
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,860
 

489
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:42,410
 ceases and this is very poorly

490
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:42,410
 

491
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:44,660
 understood how it knows when to stop I

492
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,660
 

493
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:45,980
 want to introduce you to another animal

494
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,980
 

495
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,510
 that you'll see more of later in the

496
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,510
 

497
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:49,010
 talk this is a planarian that same

498
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,010
 

499
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:52,100
 flatworm i mentioned a minute ago

500
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,100
 

501
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:55,130
 these can be cut into pieces the record

502
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:55,130
 

503
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:56,690
 is 275 and each piece there they're

504
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,690
 

505
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:58,790
 about a 2 centimeters long by the way

506
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,790
 

507
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:01,130
 and each of these pieces will regrow

508
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,130
 

509
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:03,200
 exactly what's needed no more no less

510
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,200
 

511
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:04,850
 to make a perfect worm every piece of

512
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,850
 

513
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,800
 this animal knows exactly what the

514
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,800
 

515
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:08,600
 correct worm looks like and in fact the

516
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,600
 

517
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,310
 regenerative properties are so

518
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,310
 

519
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,680
 remarkable that they've conquered aging

520
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,680
 

521
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:14,750
 these worms are literally immortal the

522
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,750
 

523
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,190
 individual cells will senescent die but

524
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,190
 

525
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,750
 the animal as a whole continues to

526
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,750
 

527
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:20,810
 regenerate them and there is no such

528
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:20,810
 

529
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:22,430
 thing as an old planarian so now

530
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,430
 

531
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:25,220
 regeneration is not just for so-called

532
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,220
 

533
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:27,830
 lower animals the human liver is highly

534
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,830
 

535
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:30,620
 regenerative deer will regrow their

536
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,620
 

537
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:32,300
 antlers or bone highly innervated bone

538
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,300
 

539
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:34,700
 up to a rate of a centimeter and a half

540
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,700
 

541
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,680
 per day of new bone growth every year

542
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,680
 

543
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,510
 and you may or may not know that human

544
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,510
 

545
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,970
 children below the age of approximately

546
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,970
 

547
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:42,560
 7 to 11 are able to regenerate their

548
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,560
 

549
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:45,950
 fingertips and this was discovered in

550
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:45,950
 

551
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,960
 the 70s but then this ability ceases

552
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,960
 

553
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:52,340
 with age so most of you shouldn't

554
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:52,340
 

555
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:54,380
 shouldn't try this so what we what we

556
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,380
 

557
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:56,360
 see here is that actually the control

558
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,360
 

559
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:58,160
 structure of this process is not an

560
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:58,160
 

561
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,650
 open-loop system but actually is a

562
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,650
 

563
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,620
 closed loop that has some very important

564
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,620
 

565
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:06,140
 error detection and control functions

566
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,140
 

567
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:09,680
 here where deviations from this target

568
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:09,680
 

569
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:11,690
 morphology lead to changes both at the

570
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,690
 

571
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,860
 transcriptional level but also at the in

572
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,860
 

573
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:15,290
 the physicals in the

574
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,290
 

575
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:17,330
 processes that allow sales to rebuild

576
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,330
 

577
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:19,520
 and so there's this constant homeostatic

578
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,520
 

579
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:22,460
 loop and one of the goals of my Center

580
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:22,460
 

581
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:24,740
 is to target the setpoint the anatomical

582
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,740
 

583
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:26,750
 set point of this homeostatic process to

584
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,750
 

585
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:28,580
 be able to recess off' i what the cells

586
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,580
 

587
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:30,800
 should build this is what we're working

588
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,800
 

589
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:34,030
 towards we discovered several years ago

590
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:34,030
 

591
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:36,050
 that really the capabilities of

592
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,050
 

593
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:38,180
 biological things to build towards a

594
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,180
 

595
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:40,250
 spec are really amazing so in in the

596
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,250
 

597
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:43,190
 journey of from from a tadpole to a frog

598
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,190
 

599
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:44,600
 all kinds of remodeling has to happen so

600
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,600
 

601
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:46,250
 the eyes have to move together and

602
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,250
 

603
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,650
 forward the nostrils have to move the

604
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,650
 

605
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:50,450
 whole face remodels and when we made

606
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,450
 

607
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:51,770
 these sort of picasso like tadpoles

608
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,770
 

609
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:53,750
 where everything was in the wrong place

610
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,750
 

611
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:55,550
 the i was in the back and the jaws were

612
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,550
 

613
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:57,260
 off to the side the starting positions

614
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,260
 

615
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:59,570
 were all off they largely still

616
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,570
 

617
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:03,220
 remodeled into a perfectly normal frog

618
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,220
 

619
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:05,420
 all of the organs moved in unnatural

620
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:05,420
 

621
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:07,490
 configurations until they reached this

622
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:07,490
 

623
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:09,500
 normal frog morphology even though their

624
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,500
 

625
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:11,870
 starting positions were not the same and

626
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,870
 

627
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:14,600
 so we know that what the genome encodes

628
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,600
 

629
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:16,700
 is not a rote set of movements that

630
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,700
 

631
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,020
 every organ can simply undergo and and

632
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,020
 

633
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,820
 give rise to whatever it gives rise to

634
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:19,820
 

635
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:21,500
 but they can actually tell when they're

636
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,500
 

637
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,740
 in the wrong configuration and it will

638
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:23,740
 

639
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:27,080
 keep moving until the correct pattern is

640
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:27,080
 

641
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:28,490
 constructed and understanding this

642
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,490
 

643
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,460
 process i taking advantage of it is

644
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,460
 

645
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:33,680
 extremely important over over 50 years

646
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:33,680
 

647
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:36,200
 ago people realize that if you take a

648
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:36,200
 

649
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:39,470
 salamander tale and graft it onto the

650
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:39,470
 

651
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:41,600
 edge of a limb amputation so you put a

652
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,600
 

653
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:43,670
 tail where the limb ought to be over the

654
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:43,670
 

655
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,380
 coming months this this structure is

656
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,380
 

657
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:47,480
 actually going to be remodeled from a

658
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:47,480
 

659
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:49,640
 tail into a limb as this whole system

660
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,640
 

661
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,100
 seeks to restore its large-scale global

662
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:52,100
 

663
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:54,410
 order so understand what this means this

664
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:54,410
 

665
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:56,060
 is not an individual cell deciding it's

666
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,060
 

667
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:58,520
 going to be muscle or skin or anything

668
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,520
 

669
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:01,250
 else this is large-scale decision making

670
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:01,250
 

671
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:04,190
 at the level of the entire organism and

672
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,190
 

673
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:07,880
 so fundamentally this is a computational

674
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:07,880
 

675
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:10,330
 problem and we would like to use this as

676
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:10,330
 

677
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,740
 inspiration for technology that can

678
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,740
 

679
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:15,380
 implement this kind of highly robust

680
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:15,380
 

681
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:17,480
 plastic behavior in the face of radical

682
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,480
 

683
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:19,190
 deformation very new kinds of

684
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,190
 

685
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,870
 environmental perturbations these

686
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,870
 

687
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:23,060
 systems are able to regain their

688
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,060
 

689
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:25,430
 structure and function now what

690
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:25,430
 

691
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:26,240
 determines patterning we start life as

692
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,240
 

693
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:27,470
 as

694
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,470
 

695
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,899
 as an egg and than a collection of

696
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,899
 

697
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:31,670
 embryonic stem cells and eventually this

698
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:31,670
 

699
00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:33,350
 is a cross-section taken through a

700
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,350
 

701
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:36,560
 normal human torso you can see the

702
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,560
 

703
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:38,630
 amazing invariant locations of all the

704
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,630
 

705
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,220
 organs and the and the geometry of all

706
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,220
 

707
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:42,649
 the structures where does this come from

708
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:42,649
 

709
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:44,420
 DNA after all the genome specifies

710
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,420
 

711
00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:46,610
 proteins it does not say directly

712
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:46,610
 

713
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:49,010
 anything about this this shape or how

714
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,010
 

715
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:50,959
 it's edited how do cell groups know what

716
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,959
 

717
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:52,250
 to make and when to stop and then as

718
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:52,250
 

719
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,920
 engineers of course we'd like to know

720
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,920
 

721
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:56,720
 how far can we push this process what's

722
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,720
 

723
00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:00,230
 possible to build what are the edges of

724
00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:00,230
 

725
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,399
 biological possibility and so you might

726
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,399
 

727
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:03,589
 be surprised to know that as

728
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:03,589
 

729
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:04,970
 developmental biologists we basically

730
00:17:03,579 --> 00:17:04,970
 

731
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:07,040
 don't know the answer to any of these

732
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,040
 

733
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:08,929
 questions we have this significant

734
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,929
 

735
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:12,319
 knowledge gap that while we're very good

736
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:12,319
 

737
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:14,240
 at constructing these kinds of networks

738
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:14,240
 

739
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,890
 we're into where we find out which gene

740
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,890
 

741
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,740
 products interact with which other gene

742
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,740
 

743
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:20,750
 products we can't yet read a genome and

744
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:20,750
 

745
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:22,760
 find out what shape the resulting organ

746
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,760
 

747
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:24,260
 M is gonna be we can compare it to other

748
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,260
 

749
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,699
 genomes where we already know what it

750
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,699
 

751
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:27,290
 looks like but we can't read a genome

752
00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:27,290
 

753
00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:29,720
 and figure out what the what geometry

754
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,720
 

755
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:31,309
 had specifies what's what's even worse

756
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,309
 

757
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,679
 in terms of medicine is that if we

758
00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:33,679
 

759
00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:36,470
 wanted to fix an anatomical structure

760
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:36,470
 

761
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,179
 here what we have our molecular

762
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,179
 

763
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:40,610
 information of this kind we have these

764
00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:40,610
 

765
00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:43,040
 networks that make it very difficult to

766
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,040
 

767
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:45,020
 solve the inverse problem that that will

768
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,020
 

769
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:48,200
 allow us to know what to change at this

770
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:48,200
 

771
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:50,630
 level to make to have outcomes desirable

772
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:50,630
 

773
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,790
 outcomes at the system level and so we

774
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,790
 

775
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:54,800
 have here huge opportunities for machine

776
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,800
 

777
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:57,110
 learning to impact regenerative medicine

778
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:57,110
 

779
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,970
 beyond drug discovery to help us be able

780
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,970
 

781
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:01,220
 to take this kind of information and

782
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,220
 

783
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:03,800
 understand how it maps to specific

784
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,800
 

785
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:05,960
 Anatomy in biology we're becoming very

786
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,960
 

787
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:08,540
 good at manipulating molecules and cells

788
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:08,540
 

789
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:11,270
 the very the very lowest level hardware

790
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:11,270
 

791
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:13,670
 that is that is necessary for the

792
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,670
 

793
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:15,320
 control of complex pattern what we don't

794
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,320
 

795
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:17,270
 really understand yet are the algorithms

796
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,270
 

797
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:19,070
 that are sufficient for the kind of

798
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,070
 

799
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:21,200
 pattern editing examples that I just

800
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,200
 

801
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:23,690
 showed you and so can we move biology

802
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,690
 

803
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,700
 beyond this kind of machine code and I

804
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,700
 

805
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:26,990
 visualize it like this where computer

806
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:26,990
 

807
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,059
 sciences have this wonderful journey

808
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,059
 

809
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:30,380
 from from having to alter the hardware

810
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:30,380
 

811
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:32,809
 when you were programming all the way up

812
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:32,809
 

813
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:34,340
 to now considerable platform

814
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,340
 

815
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:36,320
 independence where you can really just

816
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,320
 

817
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:38,600
 focus on the control algorithms and the

818
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,600
 

819
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,040
 computations biology is still here

820
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,040
 

821
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,800
 everything we do

822
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:42,800
 

823
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:44,660
 in our experiments is is rewiring the

824
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,660
 

825
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,730
 actual hardware of the organism we have

826
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,730
 

827
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:48,530
 not yet gotten to the point where we can

828
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,530
 

829
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:50,150
 we can focus on the control algorithms

830
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,150
 

831
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:51,890
 and really take advantage of the

832
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,890
 

833
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:54,050
 hardware software distinction which I do

834
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,050
 

835
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:55,810
 believe also exists in biology and this

836
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,810
 

837
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:59,330
 is what my group has been trying to do

838
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,330
 

839
00:18:55,810 --> 00:19:01,070
 so pattern homeostasis has a number of

840
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,070
 

841
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:02,930
 properties that are in a certain sense

842
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,930
 

843
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:05,540
 cognitive they show goal directed

844
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,540
 

845
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:07,940
 behavior towards specific outcomes they

846
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,940
 

847
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:09,650
 show flexibility and robustness under

848
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:09,650
 

849
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:11,390
 variable conditions and they allow

850
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,390
 

851
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:13,970
 integration of self and low-level

852
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,970
 

853
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:18,020
 functions into complex large-scale

854
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,020
 

855
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:19,730
 outcomes and so what I want to talk to

856
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:19,730
 

857
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:21,590
 you about now are some of the progress

858
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,590
 

859
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:23,690
 that we've made about understanding how

860
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,690
 

861
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:26,270
 electrical mechanisms that is electrical

862
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,270
 

863
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:30,140
 communication among cells allow this

864
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:30,140
 

865
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:31,850
 kind of control and basically what I'm

866
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:31,850
 

867
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:34,280
 going to show you everything in the next

868
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,280
 

869
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:36,350
 section can be boiled down to one main

870
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,350
 

871
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:39,410
 message that very much like the brain

872
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:39,410
 

873
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:41,360
 somatic tissues form electrical networks

874
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,360
 

875
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:42,680
 that make decisions the decisions they

876
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,680
 

877
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,810
 make are not about behavior they're

878
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,810
 

879
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,640
 about anatomy and we now can target the

880
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,640
 

881
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:49,120
 system for some control of large-scale

882
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:49,120
 

883
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,440
 pattern editing and so I show you this

884
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,440
 

885
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,880
 five legged frog here to point out that

886
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,880
 

887
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,110
 this is not Photoshop I'm gonna show you

888
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:54,110
 

889
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,580
 a bunch of really strange-looking

890
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,580
 

891
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,680
 animals in a minute and this is these

892
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,680
 

893
00:19:55,580 --> 00:20:00,770
 are all real live creatures that are

894
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:00,770
 

895
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:02,960
 that live in our lab because the way

896
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,960
 

897
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:05,030
 that we test our various models of

898
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:05,030
 

899
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,220
 whether we've understood how this works

900
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,220
 

901
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:08,870
 is to try to make rational perturbations

902
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,870
 

903
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:11,000
 we try to control anatomical

904
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:11,000
 

905
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:13,130
 decision-making so it's important to

906
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,130
 

907
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,410
 realize that brains did not invent their

908
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,410
 

909
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:19,130
 tricks from scratch basically neurons

910
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,130
 

911
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:20,780
 evolved from very ancient cells that

912
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,780
 

913
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:23,870
 were around and performing computations

914
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:23,870
 

915
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:26,240
 and doing somatic decision-making long

916
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,240
 

917
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:28,940
 before neurons and brains showed up and

918
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:28,940
 

919
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,520
 in fact are unicellular ancestors before

920
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,520
 

921
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:33,830
 even the origin of multicellularity

922
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:33,830
 

923
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:35,930
 already had synaptic machinery ion

924
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,930
 

925
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:37,190
 channels neurotransmitters this by the

926
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,190
 

927
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:40,490
 way if you've ever wondered why it is

928
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:40,490
 

929
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:43,100
 that fungi which are very very distant

930
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,100
 

931
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:46,070
 organism from ours from ourselves why

932
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:46,070
 

933
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:47,570
 fungi have compounds in them like these

934
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,570
 

935
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:49,610
 hallucinogenic mushrooms that are able

936
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,610
 

937
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:51,740
 to affect human cognition it's because

938
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,740
 

939
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:52,700
 the basic mechanisms are extremely

940
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:52,700
 

941
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:55,490
 ancient

942
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:55,490
 

943
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:59,510
 very old and that basically in becoming

944
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,510
 

945
00:20:55,490 --> 00:21:01,400
 brains nervous systems speed optimized

946
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,400
 

947
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:04,250
 functions that were already here long

948
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:04,250
 

949
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:06,380
 before that and so we all know that in

950
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,380
 

951
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:09,470
 the brain you have hardware that's

952
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:09,470
 

953
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:12,590
 produced by these these ion channels

954
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,590
 

955
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:14,480
 that enable cells in the brain to

956
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,480
 

957
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:16,190
 communicate electrically with each other

958
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:16,190
 

959
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,450
 so they mediated mediate electrical

960
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,450
 

961
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:19,850
 state change that can be propagated

962
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,850
 

963
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:21,440
 through a network and this kind of

964
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,440
 

965
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:22,850
 hardware gives rise to some very

966
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,850
 

967
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,010
 interesting software that we would all

968
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,010
 

969
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:26,960
 like to understand to take advantage of

970
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,960
 

971
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:28,850
 so the cognitive and behavioral

972
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,850
 

973
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,920
 processing that goes on in the

974
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,920
 

975
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:33,260
 electrical network that is encoded and

976
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:33,260
 

977
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,730
 enabled by this hardware well it turns

978
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,730
 

979
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:37,010
 out that the rest of the body is not

980
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,010
 

981
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:39,470
 very much different all cells not just

982
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,470
 

983
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:41,510
 neurons have the exact same types of ion

984
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,510
 

985
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:43,070
 channels they make electrical synapses

986
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,070
 

987
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:46,610
 to their neighbors and they produce

988
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,610
 

989
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:48,440
 electrical paths electrical patterns

990
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,440
 

991
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:50,450
 such as here what you're seeing here is

992
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:50,450
 

993
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,730
 an early frog embryo this is this is

994
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,730
 

995
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:55,040
 sped up this is about eight hours of an

996
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,040
 

997
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:56,450
 early frog embryo and much like here you

998
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,450
 

999
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,760
 can see the electrical activity of the

1000
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,760
 

1001
00:21:56,450 --> 00:22:00,890
 zebrafish brain as the zebrafish

1002
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,890
 

1003
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:03,620
 processes visual information what you

1004
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,620
 

1005
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:05,360
 can see here with pseudo color are all

1006
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:05,360
 

1007
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:07,160
 the electrical conversations that these

1008
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,160
 

1009
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,020
 cells are having with each other as they

1010
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:09,020
 

1011
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,820
 figure out who's going to be front who's

1012
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:10,820
 

1013
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:14,530
 going to be back left-right dorsal

1014
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:14,530
 

1015
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:18,050
 ventral and so on so as people try to

1016
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:18,050
 

1017
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:21,410
 understand how this to decode how the

1018
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,410
 

1019
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:24,020
 electrical states of the brain stand for

1020
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,020
 

1021
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:26,120
 different of memories behaviors and so

1022
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,120
 

1023
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:28,670
 on we have to understand and we have to

1024
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:28,670
 

1025
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:30,980
 crack this bioelectrical code how it is

1026
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,980
 

1027
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:33,170
 that the changing electrical properties

1028
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:33,170
 

1029
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:36,140
 of the tissues implement different

1030
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,140
 

1031
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:38,150
 future anatomical States and so here's

1032
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:38,150
 

1033
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:40,790
 an example this is just a snapshot of an

1034
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,790
 

1035
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:42,520
 early frog tadpole like this this is the

1036
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,520
 

1037
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:45,140
 mid flank the different colors are a

1038
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:45,140
 

1039
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:46,700
 fluorescent voltage reporter that shows

1040
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,700
 

1041
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:48,410
 us in living tissue what all the

1042
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,410
 

1043
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,850
 electrical states are and each one of

1044
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,850
 

1045
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:51,740
 these little circles is a single cell

1046
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,740
 

1047
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:53,420
 and this cell has a variety of ion

1048
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,420
 

1049
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:55,160
 channels just like neurons do that

1050
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:55,160
 

1051
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:57,050
 enable them to maintain this particular

1052
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,050
 

1053
00:22:55,160 --> 00:23:00,320
 structure so this is what we call a V

1054
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,320
 

1055
00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:02,300
 mem or a membrane voltage pattern and

1056
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,300
 

1057
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,370
 these patterns we're able to see them

1058
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,370
 

1059
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:06,350
 using a variety of technologies such as

1060
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,350
 

1061
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:07,700
 voltage sensitive fluorescent dyes

1062
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,700
 

1063
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:09,950
 and we do a lot of quantitative

1064
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,950
 

1065
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:12,110
 simulations to try and understand how

1066
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,110
 

1067
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:14,570
 the different ion channel and pump

1068
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,570
 

1069
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:17,840
 proteins give rise to specific patterns

1070
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,840
 

1071
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:19,970
 in multicellular tissues these patterns

1072
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,970
 

1073
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,830
 come in two flavors there are normal or

1074
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,830
 

1075
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:23,720
 endogenous patterns so this is again a

1076
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,720
 

1077
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:25,280
 frog embryo this time in greyscale and

1078
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,280
 

1079
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,530
 you can see here that as it's putting

1080
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,530
 

1081
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,720
 its face together here's basically a pre

1082
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,720
 

1083
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:31,370
 pattern or a little map of what the gene

1084
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:31,370
 

1085
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,540
 expression and the anatomy of the face

1086
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,540
 

1087
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:34,160
 is going to look like so here's where

1088
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,160
 

1089
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:35,690
 the eye is gonna form here's what the

1090
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,690
 

1091
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,950
 mouth is going to be and so on so these

1092
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,950
 

1093
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:38,810
 are patterns that are critical for

1094
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,810
 

1095
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:41,420
 normal development if you move or

1096
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,420
 

1097
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:43,520
 perturb these patterns the the anatomy

1098
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:43,520
 

1099
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:45,740
 will be will be altered these patterns

1100
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:45,740
 

1101
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,690
 can also be pathological here you see

1102
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:47,690
 

1103
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:49,880
 the earliest signs of cancer we induced

1104
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,880
 

1105
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:51,770
 a tumor in this temple but before the

1106
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:51,770
 

1107
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,030
 tumor shows up these cells right here

1108
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,030
 

1109
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:56,120
 you can already see their abnormal

1110
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:56,120
 

1111
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:57,560
 electrical state as they stop

1112
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:57,560
 

1113
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,120
 communicating with their neighbors and

1114
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,120
 

1115
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:01,220
 sort of revert back to an almost

1116
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:01,220
 

1117
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,410
 unicellular like existence and and

1118
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:03,410
 

1119
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:05,300
 become become cancer cells so

1120
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,300
 

1121
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:08,000
 functionally we've developed some tools

1122
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:08,000
 

1123
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:10,400
 to control this type of signaling in

1124
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:10,400
 

1125
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,500
 this non neural cell Network basically

1126
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,500
 

1127
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,970
 we do not apply electrical field so that

1128
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:13,970
 

1129
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,220
 is that's not how this is done there's

1130
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,220
 

1131
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:18,860
 no no electrical electrodes being used

1132
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:18,860
 

1133
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:21,320
 here what we do is we manipulate the

1134
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:21,320
 

1135
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:23,510
 endogenous ion channels that allow cells

1136
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:23,510
 

1137
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:25,280
 to produce electrical States or we

1138
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,280
 

1139
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:27,110
 perturb the connectivity so we can

1140
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:27,110
 

1141
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:29,240
 either control the topology of the

1142
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,240
 

1143
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:30,610
 network or actually the electrical state

1144
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:30,610
 

1145
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,810
 and we use a variety of genetic

1146
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,810
 

1147
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:35,450
 pharmacological optogenetic and and

1148
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,450
 

1149
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:37,220
 those kinds of techniques so I want to

1150
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,220
 

1151
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:39,140
 show you some examples of why this is

1152
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:39,140
 

1153
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:41,780
 important what you can do when you when

1154
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:41,780
 

1155
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:44,090
 you alter the electrical circuits so one

1156
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:44,090
 

1157
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:47,000
 thing you can do is you can convince

1158
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,000
 

1159
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:48,770
 cell groups to become different organs

1160
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:48,770
 

1161
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,600
 and I don't mean to control individual

1162
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,600
 

1163
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:52,610
 cell types this is not about stem cell

1164
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,610
 

1165
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,200
 differentiation but for example we can

1166
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,200
 

1167
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:55,700
 take a region of this gut so this whole

1168
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,700
 

1169
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,740
 thing is the gut of the temple we can

1170
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,740
 

1171
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:00,110
 take this region we can change its

1172
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:00,110
 

1173
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:01,310
 electrical properties by by opening a

1174
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,310
 

1175
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:03,740
 particular kind of channel this

1176
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,740
 

1177
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:05,240
 voltage-gated potassium channel and what

1178
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,240
 

1179
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,980
 will happen is this whole once we

1180
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,980
 

1181
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,990
 establish a particular electron state

1182
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:08,990
 

1183
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:11,750
 this whole region becomes an i and if

1184
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:11,750
 

1185
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:13,340
 you section this is a m-- interior

1186
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,340
 

1187
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:15,200
 interior components that you would find

1188
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:15,200
 

1189
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:17,120
 in a normal eye so retina optic nerve

1190
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:17,120
 

1191
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,309
 lens all of these things are in there so

1192
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:19,309
 

1193
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,990
 this is a modular control that

1194
00:25:19,299 --> 00:25:20,990
 

1195
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:22,759
 says right here you're going to form an

1196
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,759
 

1197
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:24,980
 eye the same thing can happen in

1198
00:25:22,749 --> 00:25:24,980
 

1199
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:26,539
 planaria where if we cut off the head in

1200
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:26,539
 

1201
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:27,980
 the tail and we take this middle

1202
00:25:26,529 --> 00:25:27,980
 

1203
00:25:26,539 --> 00:25:30,889
 fragment which has this very interesting

1204
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:30,889
 

1205
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:32,509
 head tail Electrical pre pattern what we

1206
00:25:30,879 --> 00:25:32,509
 

1207
00:25:30,889 --> 00:25:33,620
 can do is take these cells and convince

1208
00:25:32,499 --> 00:25:33,620
 

1209
00:25:32,509 --> 00:25:35,480
 them that they should make a head

1210
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:35,480
 

1211
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:37,190
 instead of a tail and you see that here

1212
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,190
 

1213
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,360
 this is a two-headed worm in fact you

1214
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,360
 

1215
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:40,909
 could go in the other direction you can

1216
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:40,909
 

1217
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:42,620
 make a note headed room and in all cases

1218
00:25:40,899 --> 00:25:42,620
 

1219
00:25:40,909 --> 00:25:44,659
 this is very important this is well this

1220
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,659
 

1221
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:46,370
 is modular because what we're not doing

1222
00:25:44,649 --> 00:25:46,370
 

1223
00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:48,230
 is going in and micromanaging the

1224
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,230
 

1225
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:49,850
 process we are not trying to layout cell

1226
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,850
 

1227
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:51,320
 by cell as you might if you are doing

1228
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,320
 

1229
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:52,879
 bioengineering we're not trying to

1230
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,879
 

1231
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:55,190
 layout cell by cell what the structure

1232
00:25:52,869 --> 00:25:55,190
 

1233
00:25:52,879 --> 00:25:57,470
 is we're providing actually a fairly

1234
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,470
 

1235
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:59,299
 small amount of information that tells

1236
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,299
 

1237
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:00,919
 this region what it should be it's it's

1238
00:25:59,289 --> 00:26:00,919
 

1239
00:25:59,299 --> 00:26:03,409
 basically a subroutine trigger at that

1240
00:26:00,909 --> 00:26:03,409
 

1241
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:04,820
 point and so you could use that using

1242
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:04,820
 

1243
00:26:03,409 --> 00:26:06,590
 this process some of the other things

1244
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,590
 

1245
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:08,659
 you can do we can take this flat worm

1246
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,659
 

1247
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:10,039
 that has a triangular head and when we

1248
00:26:08,649 --> 00:26:10,039
 

1249
00:26:08,659 --> 00:26:11,629
 cut off the head we can treat the

1250
00:26:10,029 --> 00:26:11,629
 

1251
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:13,909
 remaining fragment in a way that

1252
00:26:11,619 --> 00:26:13,909
 

1253
00:26:11,629 --> 00:26:15,679
 convinces the new cells to build heads

1254
00:26:13,899 --> 00:26:15,679
 

1255
00:26:13,909 --> 00:26:17,480
 that belong to other species of flat

1256
00:26:15,669 --> 00:26:17,480
 

1257
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,340
 worms so here's a nice flat head like

1258
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:19,340
 

1259
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,869
 this pea Felina or you can make a round

1260
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:20,869
 

1261
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:23,480
 head like an S Mediterranea or a

1262
00:26:20,859 --> 00:26:23,480
 

1263
00:26:20,869 --> 00:26:25,730
 triangular head like the original should

1264
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:25,730
 

1265
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:28,159
 be notice that first of all it's about

1266
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,159
 

1267
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:30,139
 150 million years of evolution that

1268
00:26:28,149 --> 00:26:30,139
 

1269
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,629
 separate these animals so you're making

1270
00:26:30,129 --> 00:26:32,629
 

1271
00:26:30,139 --> 00:26:34,940
 heads with brain structures and stem

1272
00:26:32,619 --> 00:26:34,940
 

1273
00:26:32,629 --> 00:26:38,059
 cell distributions that belong to these

1274
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:38,059
 

1275
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:40,850
 other species across about 150 million

1276
00:26:38,049 --> 00:26:40,850
 

1277
00:26:38,059 --> 00:26:42,860
 years of evolution also note that the

1278
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,860
 

1279
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:44,480
 genome is here is normal we have not

1280
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:44,480
 

1281
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:46,639
 done any genomic editing this is not

1282
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,639
 

1283
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,980
 about changing the genome this is this

1284
00:26:46,629 --> 00:26:48,980
 

1285
00:26:46,639 --> 00:26:52,190
 is purely a physiological change this is

1286
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:52,190
 

1287
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:54,379
 interacting with the real-time software

1288
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,379
 

1289
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:57,769
 as it were of the physiological system

1290
00:26:54,369 --> 00:26:57,769
 

1291
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:59,690
 not rewiring the genes or the or the

1292
00:26:57,759 --> 00:26:59,690
 

1293
00:26:57,769 --> 00:27:01,369
 protein networks that are existing in

1294
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,369
 

1295
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:03,080
 this animal so all of these animals with

1296
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:03,080
 

1297
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:05,299
 heads belonging to other species have a

1298
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:05,299
 

1299
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:07,730
 perfectly normal wild-type genomic

1300
00:27:05,289 --> 00:27:07,730
 

1301
00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:10,399
 sequence that belongs to GGC adhirata

1302
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,399
 

1303
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:12,259
 safale so you can go further than this

1304
00:27:10,389 --> 00:27:12,259
 

1305
00:27:10,399 --> 00:27:14,299
 and you can reach regions of the

1306
00:27:12,249 --> 00:27:14,299
 

1307
00:27:12,259 --> 00:27:16,580
 planarian Morpha space that evolution

1308
00:27:14,289 --> 00:27:16,580
 

1309
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,960
 isn't using so from a normal flat worm

1310
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:17,960
 

1311
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:19,999
 you can make things like this that are

1312
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:19,999
 

1313
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,139
 sort of spiky you can make these that

1314
00:27:19,989 --> 00:27:21,139
 

1315
00:27:19,999 --> 00:27:23,389
 look like hats they're three-dimensional

1316
00:27:21,129 --> 00:27:23,389
 

1317
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:24,860
 they have an interior compartment or you

1318
00:27:23,379 --> 00:27:24,860
 

1319
00:27:23,389 --> 00:27:26,869
 can make ones that look like this with

1320
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:26,869
 

1321
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:28,850
 tubes coming out of their backs so we're

1322
00:27:26,859 --> 00:27:28,850
 

1323
00:27:26,869 --> 00:27:31,159
 just now beginning to really understand

1324
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,159
 

1325
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:32,550
 the way that different anatomical

1326
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,550
 

1327
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:34,140
 structures are encoded in

1328
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,140
 

1329
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:35,580
 the electrical properties of a neck of

1330
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:35,580
 

1331
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:38,310
 the network but it's very clear that

1332
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,310
 

1333
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:41,280
 there's a very tractable a profoundly

1334
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:41,280
 

1335
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:43,560
 important level of software control that

1336
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:43,560
 

1337
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:45,270
 can be implemented beyond the genome all

1338
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:45,270
 

1339
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:47,130
 of these animals have the same genomic

1340
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,130
 

1341
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:48,540
 sequence and so this is really really

1342
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,540
 

1343
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:50,550
 important to begin to learn how to

1344
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:50,550
 

1345
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:52,830
 target this for our various applications

1346
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,830
 

1347
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:54,660
 we've done lots of computational

1348
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,660
 

1349
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:56,730
 modeling to try to understand these

1350
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:56,730
 

1351
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:58,770
 electrical circuits and how the

1352
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,770
 

1353
00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:02,070
 dynamical systems properties of these

1354
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,070
 

1355
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:05,580
 circuits map onto specific anatomical

1356
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:05,580
 

1357
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:08,370
 outcomes and so one of the predictions

1358
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:08,370
 

1359
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:10,670
 of this kind of unusual view that these

1360
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,670
 

1361
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:14,130
 are all that these pattern memories are

1362
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:14,130
 

1363
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:15,750
 states of physiological electrical

1364
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,750
 

1365
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:17,610
 network is that we ought to be able to

1366
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,610
 

1367
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:18,900
 rewrite this pattern memory and I want

1368
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,900
 

1369
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:21,270
 to show you one example that we just

1370
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:21,270
 

1371
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:24,090
 published last year which is that if we

1372
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:24,090
 

1373
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:25,920
 take these normal-looking planaria so

1374
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,920
 

1375
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:28,080
 one head one tail and in fact

1376
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:28,080
 

1377
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:29,760
 molecularly if we look at the markers so

1378
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,760
 

1379
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,500
 the head markers are in the head there

1380
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,500
 

1381
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,050
 are no head markers in the tail and so

1382
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:34,050
 

1383
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:35,700
 on these will give rise to a one-headed

1384
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,700
 

1385
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:37,470
 worm if we chop off the head and the

1386
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:37,470
 

1387
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,390
 tail these will give rise to a

1388
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,390
 

1389
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:41,070
 two-headed worm why would an animal that

1390
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,070
 

1391
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:43,970
 has a perfectly normal one headed

1392
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,970
 

1393
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:46,380
 Anatomy and apparently normal molecular

1394
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,380
 

1395
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:48,960
 molecular expression the pattern why

1396
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:48,960
 

1397
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:50,580
 would they give rise to two-headed worms

1398
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:50,580
 

1399
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,500
 and the reason and again this is not

1400
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:52,500
 

1401
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:54,450
 anything to do with genomic editing and

1402
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:54,450
 

1403
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:56,910
 the reason is because what we did was we

1404
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,910
 

1405
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:59,340
 went in and we altered the electrical

1406
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,340
 

1407
00:28:56,910 --> 00:29:01,500
 pre pattern that dictates what this at

1408
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:01,500
 

1409
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:04,170
 what this tissue is going to do if it is

1410
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:04,170
 

1411
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:06,630
 injured in the future so this one had an

1412
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,630
 

1413
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:08,670
 animal has an is bearing an electrical

1414
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,670
 

1415
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:10,020
 memory that says that if I get injured

1416
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,020
 

1417
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:12,180
 in the future what I'm going to do is

1418
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:12,180
 

1419
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:14,130
 build two heads instead of one so the

1420
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:14,130
 

1421
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:17,040
 electrical pattern is not a readout of

1422
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,040
 

1423
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:19,410
 what the anatomy is now it is a piece of

1424
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:19,410
 

1425
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:23,400
 encoded information a patterning Engram

1426
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,400
 

1427
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:25,380
 that is used if if the animal is injured

1428
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:25,380
 

1429
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:27,510
 and it is used to cut to to to guide

1430
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:27,510
 

1431
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:29,850
 morphogenesis in the future so what we

1432
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,850
 

1433
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:30,210
 see is that this body a single body like

1434
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,210
 

1435
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:32,670
 this

1436
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,670
 

1437
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:34,680
 can store at least one of two different

1438
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,680
 

1439
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:36,630
 pattern memories it can store one headed

1440
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:36,630
 

1441
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:38,310
 or a two-headed pattern memory no doubt

1442
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,310
 

1443
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:42,390
 probably more we've only thought been

1444
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:42,390
 

1445
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:45,720
 able to access two so far now this this

1446
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,720
 

1447
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:46,440
 is this is really a very important

1448
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:46,440
 

1449
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,259
 example because

1450
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:49,259
 

1451
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,210
 that is not just about changing the way

1452
00:29:49,249 --> 00:29:51,210
 

1453
00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:53,070
 that regeneration progresses after the

1454
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,070
 

1455
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:55,169
 injury this is a long-term phenomenon

1456
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,169
 

1457
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:58,230
 and by that what I mean is that if we

1458
00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:58,230
 

1459
00:29:55,169 --> 00:29:59,730
 take this two-headed worm and so we

1460
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,730
 

1461
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:01,500
 start with a one-headed worm we amputate

1462
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,500
 

1463
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:03,059
 the head in the tail we perturb the

1464
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:03,059
 

1465
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,649
 electrical network you get a two-headed

1466
00:30:03,049 --> 00:30:04,649
 

1467
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:06,629
 worm and now we take this two-headed

1468
00:30:04,639 --> 00:30:06,629
 

1469
00:30:04,649 --> 00:30:08,669
 worm and we leave them alone for a

1470
00:30:06,619 --> 00:30:08,669
 

1471
00:30:06,629 --> 00:30:10,679
 couple of weeks in plain old water so

1472
00:30:08,659 --> 00:30:10,679
 

1473
00:30:08,669 --> 00:30:13,110
 normal manipulation of any kind we

1474
00:30:10,669 --> 00:30:13,110
 

1475
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:15,990
 amputate the original head we amputate

1476
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,990
 

1477
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:17,940
 this weird ectopic posterior head and we

1478
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,940
 

1479
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:19,350
 ask what's going to happen and when we

1480
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,350
 

1481
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:21,330
 first did this experiment of course the

1482
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,330
 

1483
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:23,009
 standard paradigm said that well the

1484
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,009
 

1485
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:24,960
 genomics of the worm are normal and

1486
00:30:22,999 --> 00:30:24,960
 

1487
00:30:23,009 --> 00:30:26,039
 you're gonna cut off the CICC topic head

1488
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,039
 

1489
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,330
 so of course the rest of it is just

1490
00:30:26,029 --> 00:30:27,330
 

1491
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:29,190
 gonna go back to normal and you're gonna

1492
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,190
 

1493
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:30,690
 get this normal one headed worm right

1494
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,690
 

1495
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:32,009
 and of course I'm showing it to you

1496
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,009
 

1497
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:34,799
 because that's not at all what happens

1498
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:34,799
 

1499
00:30:32,009 --> 00:30:36,360
 what happens is that in perpetuity once

1500
00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:36,360
 

1501
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,980
 you've shifted that electrical Network

1502
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,980
 

1503
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,779
 that pattern memory has now been shifted

1504
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:39,779
 

1505
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:41,970
 to a 2-headed state it is now

1506
00:30:39,769 --> 00:30:41,970
 

1507
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:43,889
 permanently two-headed so if you keep

1508
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,889
 

1509
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:46,799
 cutting this animal again and again and

1510
00:30:43,879 --> 00:30:46,799
 

1511
00:30:43,889 --> 00:30:48,919
 with no further manipulations it will

1512
00:30:46,789 --> 00:30:48,919
 

1513
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:51,120
 continue to regenerate to that new

1514
00:30:48,909 --> 00:30:51,120
 

1515
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:52,830
 specification of what a worm should look

1516
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,830
 

1517
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,750
 like and and you can by the way we have

1518
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,750
 

1519
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:56,610
 now ways to I take it back and take a

1520
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,610
 

1521
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:58,590
 two-headed worm and remodel it back to

1522
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,590
 

1523
00:30:56,610 --> 00:31:00,299
 one head so this is very interesting

1524
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,299
 

1525
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:02,639
 this has this has a number of key

1526
00:31:00,289 --> 00:31:02,639
 

1527
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:06,240
 properties of memory it's it's long term

1528
00:31:02,629 --> 00:31:06,240
 

1529
00:31:02,639 --> 00:31:08,250
 stable its rewritable or labile it has

1530
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,250
 

1531
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,690
 latency or conditional recall as I just

1532
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,690
 

1533
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:11,759
 showed you we can do it so that nothing

1534
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,759
 

1535
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:14,159
 happens until the animal needs to recall

1536
00:31:11,749 --> 00:31:14,159
 

1537
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:16,649
 it by from injury and it has discrete

1538
00:31:14,149 --> 00:31:16,649
 

1539
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,539
 possible outcomes one headed or two

1540
00:31:16,639 --> 00:31:18,539
 

1541
00:31:16,649 --> 00:31:21,210
 headed so what we've been doing is

1542
00:31:18,529 --> 00:31:21,210
 

1543
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:23,070
 trying to develop techniques to

1544
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,070
 

1545
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:27,179
 basically extend certain connectionist

1546
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:27,179
 

1547
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:29,399
 models to this to this to help us guide

1548
00:31:27,169 --> 00:31:29,399
 

1549
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:32,100
 these experiments where stable

1550
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:32,100
 

1551
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:33,779
 attractors in the state space of these

1552
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,779
 

1553
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:36,899
 electrical circuits correspond to

1554
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:36,899
 

1555
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:38,909
 specific downstream downstream anatomies

1556
00:31:36,889 --> 00:31:38,909
 

1557
00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:41,549
 of course mediated by all the different

1558
00:31:38,899 --> 00:31:41,549
 

1559
00:31:38,909 --> 00:31:43,259
 genes that they turn on and off so this

1560
00:31:41,539 --> 00:31:43,259
 

1561
00:31:41,549 --> 00:31:45,480
 is really critical for us as now is to

1562
00:31:43,249 --> 00:31:45,480
 

1563
00:31:43,259 --> 00:31:47,220
 understand the large-scale properties of

1564
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,220
 

1565
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:49,409
 this bioelectric code and how these

1566
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:49,409
 

1567
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:52,169
 pattern memories are literally encoded

1568
00:31:49,399 --> 00:31:52,169
 

1569
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:53,850
 in the stable states of tissues it's

1570
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:53,850
 

1571
00:31:52,169 --> 00:31:55,440
 important not only for the basic science

1572
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,440
 

1573
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:56,460
 of it but for applications in

1574
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:56,460
 

1575
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,860
 regenerative medicine

1576
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:58,860
 

1577
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:59,680
 so unlike salamanders frogs do not

1578
00:31:58,850 --> 00:31:59,680
 

1579
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,330
 normally reach

1580
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:01,330
 

1581
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:03,370
 generate their legs so they either grow

1582
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,370
 

1583
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:05,320
 nothing or a very thin cartilage in the

1584
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,320
 

1585
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:06,970
 spike when you amputate the leg and what

1586
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,970
 

1587
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:08,800
 we've had been able to do is to come up

1588
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,800
 

1589
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:10,810
 with a cocktail that alters the

1590
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,810
 

1591
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,730
 bioelectric state of the cells at the

1592
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,730
 

1593
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:14,950
 wound to convince them to regenerate a

1594
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,950
 

1595
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:16,630
 new leg so here you can see in 45 days

1596
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,630
 

1597
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:18,520
 it's starting to make some toes here's a

1598
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,520
 

1599
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:20,680
 toenail and then eventually it's a

1600
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:20,680
 

1601
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:22,870
 pretty good leg that can feel touch and

1602
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:22,870
 

1603
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:24,310
 it's both sensitive and motile so the

1604
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,310
 

1605
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:25,510
 animal can use these legs and then

1606
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,510
 

1607
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,980
 eventually you get some you get some

1608
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,980
 

1609
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:28,240
 really nice you get some really nice

1610
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:28,240
 

1611
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:30,790
 patterning and then you have to wait for

1612
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:30,790
 

1613
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,940
 it to grow so the idea is that this is

1614
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,940
 

1615
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:35,530
 the first steps towards a program for

1616
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:35,530
 

1617
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:38,230
 regenerative medicine where we will be

1618
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,230
 

1619
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:41,950
 able to induce cells and tissues to

1620
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:41,950
 

1621
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:43,660
 regrow various complex organs this does

1622
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,660
 

1623
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:45,730
 not require implantation of stem cells

1624
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:45,730
 

1625
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:48,360
 it does not require genomic editing this

1626
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,360
 

1627
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:50,920
 is purely about triggering the kinds of

1628
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:50,920
 

1629
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:52,570
 cascades the kinds of patterning

1630
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,570
 

1631
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:54,550
 subroutines that these animals already

1632
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,550
 

1633
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:56,200
 have embedded in their electrical

1634
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,200
 

1635
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:57,940
 software and of course next after this

1636
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,940
 

1637
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,830
 frog is mammalian application so we're

1638
00:32:57,930 --> 00:32:59,830
 

1639
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:02,440
 trying to try to work up to human

1640
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,440
 

1641
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:03,670
 medicine at some point okay so one of

1642
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,670
 

1643
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,640
 the other things we've been able to show

1644
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,640
 

1645
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:08,980
 is to use some of our pre 8 predictive

1646
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:08,980
 

1647
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:12,280
 with simulations of the by electrical

1648
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:12,280
 

1649
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:14,170
 signaling to reverse a birth defects of

1650
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:14,170
 

1651
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:16,300
 different types so here's what a tadpole

1652
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,300
 

1653
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:18,010
 brain a normal tadpole brain should look

1654
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:18,010
 

1655
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:20,890
 like you see here the the forebrain the

1656
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,890
 

1657
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:22,870
 midbrain and hindbrain and under the

1658
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,870
 

1659
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:23,830
 exposure to various teratogen sand we're

1660
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,830
 

1661
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:26,080
 talking about things like alcohol

1662
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:26,080
 

1663
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:28,570
 nicotine various other nasty chemicals

1664
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:28,570
 

1665
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,650
 or even mutations in really important

1666
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,650
 

1667
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:31,690
 genes such as knotch

1668
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,690
 

1669
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:33,400
 what you get are severe brain defects so

1670
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,400
 

1671
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:35,140
 the forebrain is basically missing the

1672
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:35,140
 

1673
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:37,120
 midbrain as a bubble the hind brains all

1674
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:37,120
 

1675
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:39,430
 messed up and what we've been able to do

1676
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:39,430
 

1677
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:41,860
 is to produce by electrical simulations

1678
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,860
 

1679
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:44,290
 that tell us what electrical state we

1680
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:44,290
 

1681
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:46,330
 would have to restore in order to get

1682
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,330
 

1683
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:48,640
 back a normal brain and in fact from

1684
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,640
 

1685
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:51,340
 these simulations we can extract

1686
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:51,340
 

1687
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:53,860
 information for candidate drugs that

1688
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:53,860
 

1689
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:55,420
 will open and close various ion channels

1690
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:55,420
 

1691
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:57,520
 and you can see here a successful

1692
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,520
 

1693
00:33:55,420 --> 00:34:00,400
 applications of this this animal has a

1694
00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:00,400
 

1695
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:02,050
 mutation FX is expressing a mutation in

1696
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:02,050
 

1697
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:04,090
 a gene called notch which normally

1698
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,090
 

1699
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:06,310
 causes this terrible malformation of the

1700
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,310
 

1701
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:08,200
 brain but the structure the gene

1702
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,200
 

1703
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:09,850
 expression and even the function of the

1704
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,850
 

1705
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,710
 brain so we gave them IQ tests believe

1706
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,710
 

1707
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:13,300
 it or not you can do that in in tadpoles

1708
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,300
 

1709
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:14,800
 you can test them for learning and

1710
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:14,800
 

1711
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,839
 and they get there they get their

1712
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:16,839
 

1713
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,510
 memories back despite this this really

1714
00:34:16,829 --> 00:34:19,510
 

1715
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:21,460
 terrible genetic mutation so we really

1716
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,460
 

1717
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:23,950
 think that this is this by electrical

1718
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:23,950
 

1719
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:26,800
 network is an incredibly tractable layer

1720
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,800
 

1721
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:28,569
 that allows us to intervene in the

1722
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:28,569
 

1723
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,869
 default state that is encoded by the

1724
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:31,869
 

1725
00:34:28,569 --> 00:34:33,399
 genome and so in the future what we

1726
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:33,399
 

1727
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:34,929
 would like to do this is a kind of the

1728
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:34,929
 

1729
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:37,659
 endgame for this field which is of a

1730
00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:37,659
 

1731
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:40,839
 very long way away but the idea is to

1732
00:34:37,649 --> 00:34:40,839
 

1733
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:42,669
 have a kind of biological compiler where

1734
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:42,669
 

1735
00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:44,889
 we would be able to design our creatures

1736
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:44,889
 

1737
00:34:42,669 --> 00:34:46,839
 the way people now design things in CAD

1738
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,839
 

1739
00:34:44,889 --> 00:34:48,760
 or for 3d printing where you can design

1740
00:34:46,829 --> 00:34:48,760
 

1741
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:50,139
 at the level of Anatomy and then we

1742
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,139
 

1743
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,970
 would understand well enough what you

1744
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:51,970
 

1745
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:53,470
 would have to do to make this to make

1746
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,470
 

1747
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:56,349
 this structure actually grow and

1748
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:56,349
 

1749
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:58,300
 evolution learned very early on to

1750
00:34:56,339 --> 00:34:58,300
 

1751
00:34:56,349 --> 00:34:59,920
 exploit the computational properties of

1752
00:34:58,290 --> 00:34:59,920
 

1753
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:03,160
 electrical circuits electrical circuits

1754
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:03,160
 

1755
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,839
 has some very convenient properties in

1756
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,839
 

1757
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:06,790
 terms of information processing and

1758
00:35:04,829 --> 00:35:06,790
 

1759
00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:09,670
 evolution caught on to this very early

1760
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,670
 

1761
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:11,650
 and so under cracking this by Electrical

1762
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,650
 

1763
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:14,290
 Code will have impacts not only on

1764
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,290
 

1765
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:16,329
 regenerative medicine but also in

1766
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,329
 

1767
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:18,010
 synthetic by engineering morphological

1768
00:35:16,319 --> 00:35:18,010
 

1769
00:35:16,329 --> 00:35:20,560
 computation and so on this is really I

1770
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,560
 

1771
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:22,660
 think a very important emerging field

1772
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:22,660
 

1773
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,700
 and so what I want to are close now with

1774
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:24,700
 

1775
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:27,069
 is to talk a little bit about the future

1776
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:27,069
 

1777
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:29,170
 and this idea that perhaps we could make

1778
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:29,170
 

1779
00:35:27,069 --> 00:35:32,079
 a highly robust machine learning

1780
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,079
 

1781
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:34,540
 platform technology that is based on non

1782
00:35:32,069 --> 00:35:34,540
 

1783
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:36,220
 neural architectures and we really are

1784
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:36,220
 

1785
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:38,050
 interested in collaborators for this is

1786
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:38,050
 

1787
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:40,630
 it possible that some of the limitations

1788
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,630
 

1789
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:42,250
 of current machine learning is because

1790
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,250
 

1791
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:44,260
 people have really been focusing on

1792
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,260
 

1793
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:45,880
 imitating brains and especially human

1794
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:45,880
 

1795
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:49,060
 brain architectures and what would

1796
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:49,060
 

1797
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:53,589
 happen if we stepped way back and based

1798
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:53,589
 

1799
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:56,349
 our attempt at this on single cells and

1800
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:56,349
 

1801
00:35:53,589 --> 00:35:58,329
 tissues that are doing much more much

1802
00:35:56,339 --> 00:35:58,329
 

1803
00:35:56,349 --> 00:36:01,359
 more fundamental information processing

1804
00:35:58,319 --> 00:36:01,359
 

1805
00:35:58,329 --> 00:36:03,099
 than than what we see in brains so in

1806
00:36:01,349 --> 00:36:03,099
 

1807
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:04,900
 fact some people have started looking at

1808
00:36:03,089 --> 00:36:04,900
 

1809
00:36:03,099 --> 00:36:07,359
 this in other structures so so bone

1810
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:07,359
 

1811
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:09,160
 heart pancreatic cells all of these

1812
00:36:07,349 --> 00:36:09,160
 

1813
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:11,250
 cells have been shown to exhibit aspects

1814
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:11,250
 

1815
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:13,510
 of learning and in particular robust

1816
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,510
 

1817
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:15,160
 adjustment to novel conditions one of

1818
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,160
 

1819
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:18,069
 the most amazing things about living

1820
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:18,069
 

1821
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:19,450
 things is how good they are at adapting

1822
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:19,450
 

1823
00:36:18,069 --> 00:36:21,250
 to novel circumstances that they've

1824
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,250
 

1825
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:23,319
 never seen before and cracking this

1826
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,319
 

1827
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:26,170
 problem will be very important for

1828
00:36:23,309 --> 00:36:26,170
 

1829
00:36:23,319 --> 00:36:27,790
 robust robotics and

1830
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,790
 

1831
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:29,650
 artificial intelligence but it's

1832
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,650
 

1833
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:31,870
 critical to note that this is already

1834
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,870
 

1835
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:34,510
 present in cells long before they Accord

1836
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:34,510
 

1837
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:37,240
 the animals acquired brains so one of

1838
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,240
 

1839
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:40,540
 the things that we're doing is to try to

1840
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:40,540
 

1841
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:42,460
 extend the basic results of of

1842
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:42,460
 

1843
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:44,770
 connectionism neural networks and all of

1844
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,770
 

1845
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:48,300
 those kinds of things to be on the brain

1846
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:48,300
 

1847
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:51,160
 try to try to develop a kind of

1848
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:51,160
 

1849
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:53,470
 mathematics and and training algorithms

1850
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:53,470
 

1851
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:55,960
 that can be used on non neural networks

1852
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,960
 

1853
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:57,910
 and the other thing that we're doing is

1854
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:57,910
 

1855
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:00,310
 we've we've had a little bit of success

1856
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,310
 

1857
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:01,960
 coming up with contributions to what's

1858
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,960
 

1859
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:04,500
 called the robot scientist field which

1860
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:04,500
 

1861
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:06,850
 is basically which is basically

1862
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:06,850
 

1863
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:08,950
 platforms that use machine learning to

1864
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,950
 

1865
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:12,700
 help us actually understand what's going

1866
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:12,700
 

1867
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:14,140
 on and to to discover not just and not

1868
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:14,140
 

1869
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:16,840
 just to do number crunching but actually

1870
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:16,840
 

1871
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:19,000
 discover a models of the kinds of

1872
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:19,000
 

1873
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:21,490
 systems that were working with and so

1874
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:21,490
 

1875
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,530
 what I'd like to do now is to thank the

1876
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,530
 

1877
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:24,580
 all the people that have done some of

1878
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,580
 

1879
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:26,740
 the work that I've shown you today I

1880
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,740
 

1881
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:28,750
 want to thank my funders in particularly

1882
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:28,750
 

1883
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:31,330
 the Paul G Allen frontiers group and

1884
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:31,330
 

1885
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:33,970
 DARPA and if you wanted to see what

1886
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,970
 

1887
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:36,100
 two-headed worms actually look like and

1888
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,100
 

1889
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:38,350
 behave like this is what it is here you

1890
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:38,350
 

1891
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:40,360
 see them and we now we actually have

1892
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,360
 

1893
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:41,890
 openings both for postdoctoral work and

1894
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,890
 

1895
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:45,160
 for visiting scientists so if anybody is

1896
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,160
 

1897
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:47,710
 interested in making robotic bodies for

1898
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:47,710
 

1899
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:50,050
 various biological systems new AI

1900
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,050
 

1901
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:52,720
 platforms based on non neural

1902
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,720
 

1903
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:54,250
 architectures machine learning and all

1904
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,250
 

1905
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,870
 kinds of computer science applications

1906
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,870
 

1907
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:57,700
 we would love to collaborate and you can

1908
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,700
 

1909
00:37:55,870 --> 00:38:01,650
 get in touch with me here and I will

1910
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:01,650
 

1911
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:01,650
 take questions thank you

1912
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:19,020
 

1913
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:27,220
 hey how do you determine which

1914
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:27,220
 

1915
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:29,740
 electrical activity is just due to like

1916
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:29,740
 

1917
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:31,780
 functional movement and things like this

1918
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:31,780
 

1919
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:34,030
 in the organisms day to day life and

1920
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:34,030
 

1921
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:36,310
 which aspects are going to be used for

1922
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,310
 

1923
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:39,010
 something like regeneration and then how

1924
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,010
 

1925
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:41,830
 do you actually edit it yeah so okay so

1926
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,830
 

1927
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:43,180
 so the the convenient thing is that the

1928
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,180
 

1929
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:45,010
 kinds of electrical states that are

1930
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:45,010
 

1931
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:46,840
 important for decision making at the

1932
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,840
 

1933
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:49,750
 anatomical level have a very different

1934
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:49,750
 

1935
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:51,730
 time scale than the kinds of things that

1936
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,730
 

1937
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:53,470
 guide behavior so anything that has to

1938
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,470
 

1939
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:55,060
 do with muscle motion with neural

1940
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,060
 

1941
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:56,650
 activity the time scale you're talking

1942
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:56,650
 

1943
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:58,000
 about is milliseconds okay the

1944
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,000
 

1945
00:38:56,650 --> 00:39:00,070
 electrical activity that we deal with

1946
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:00,070
 

1947
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,260
 these patterns are stable and they

1948
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,260
 

1949
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:04,510
 change over a scale of minutes hours in

1950
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,510
 

1951
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:06,880
 some cases days so it's an entirely

1952
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,880
 

1953
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:09,070
 different set of if you will frequencies

1954
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:09,070
 

1955
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,450
 that you deal with and the way we I

1956
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,450
 

1957
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:12,760
 think your second question was how do we

1958
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,760
 

1959
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:14,170
 edit it yeah so so there's there's a

1960
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,170
 

1961
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:16,690
 couple of different approaches that we

1962
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,690
 

1963
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:19,090
 take in our model systems that we use at

1964
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,090
 

1965
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:22,090
 the bench the best way to edit it is to

1966
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:22,090
 

1967
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:24,160
 knock in controllable ion channels so we

1968
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,160
 

1969
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:25,600
 will put in novel maybe light gated

1970
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,600
 

1971
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,340
 maybe drug gate at different ion

1972
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:27,340
 

1973
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,140
 channels that allow us to have very fine

1974
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:29,140
 

1975
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:31,150
 control over all the electrical

1976
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:31,150
 

1977
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:32,650
 properties in biomedical applications

1978
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,650
 

1979
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:34,240
 you this kind of gene therapy is

1980
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,240
 

1981
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:36,430
 probably best avoided so what we do

1982
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:36,430
 

1983
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,650
 there is to develop cocktails of drugs

1984
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,650
 

1985
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:40,360
 that will open and close specific ion

1986
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,360
 

1987
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:42,250
 channels that are already in the patient

1988
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:42,250
 

1989
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:44,440
 so we have a variety of computational

1990
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,440
 

1991
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:46,060
 tools that let us look at what channels

1992
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:46,060
 

1993
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,950
 and pumps are expressed in the tissue of

1994
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,950
 

1995
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:49,450
 interest and then try to come up with a

1996
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,450
 

1997
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:52,240
 strategy that's going to get us to the

1998
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,240
 

1999
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:54,400
 electrical signaling that we want does

2000
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:54,400
 

2001
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:58,360
 that interfere with the like short-term

2002
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:58,360
 

2003
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,860
 electrical signaling it really doesn't

2004
00:39:58,350 --> 00:39:59,860
 

2005
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,880
 one of the one of the really remarkable

2006
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:00,880
 

2007
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:02,980
 things that we found so I should I

2008
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:02,980
 

2009
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,360
 should point out that back in about 2000

2010
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:04,360
 

2011
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:05,680
 when we first suggested this kind of

2012
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:05,680
 

2013
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,240
 idea this was considered completely

2014
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,240
 

2015
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,280
 crazy people said that electrical

2016
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:09,280
 

2017
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:10,630
 properties of cells are housekeeping

2018
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:10,630
 

2019
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,920
 parameters and that if we mess with it

2020
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,920
 

2021
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:13,290
 everything's gonna die that you're going

2022
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,290
 

2023
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,820
 to get an uninterpretable you know

2024
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,820
 

2025
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:18,700
 toxicity none of that is true it turns

2026
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:18,700
 

2027
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:21,040
 out that cells are very very good at

2028
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:21,040
 

2029
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:23,980
 distinguishing the different types of

2030
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:23,980
 

2031
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:26,050
 electrical signals and things that we do

2032
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:26,050
 

2033
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:28,600
 at the long-term scale do not affect

2034
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,600
 

2035
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:29,920
 behavior they can of course you can

2036
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:29,920
 

2037
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,810
 overdo it I mean part of what we've been

2038
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:31,810
 

2039
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,460
 doing for the last 15 years is coming up

2040
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,460
 

2041
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:33,599
 with protocol

2042
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:33,599
 

2043
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,920
 that have the least amount of side

2044
00:40:33,589 --> 00:40:34,920
 

2045
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:37,500
 effects possible right so you certainly

2046
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:37,500
 

2047
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:39,599
 can overwhelm the system but these these

2048
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:39,599
 

2049
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:41,070
 are designed to work in parallel and in

2050
00:40:39,589 --> 00:40:41,070
 

2051
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,750
 fact in all of these organisms the

2052
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,750
 

2053
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:44,940
 regenerating planarian or the

2054
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,940
 

2055
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:46,830
 regenerating salamander is running

2056
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:46,830
 

2057
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:48,900
 around eating behaving doing all that

2058
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,900
 

2059
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:50,790
 stuff while all the cells are figuring

2060
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:50,790
 

2061
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:53,040
 out what to do so there's a multi scale

2062
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:53,040
 

2063
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:54,800
 set of problem solving that does not

2064
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,800
 

2065
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:59,339
 interfere with each other

2066
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:59,339
 

2067
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:00,869
 phenomenal talk thank you okay thank you

2068
00:40:59,329 --> 00:41:00,869
 

2069
00:40:59,339 --> 00:41:02,040
 very much for your a very interesting

2070
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:02,040
 

2071
00:41:00,869 --> 00:41:05,010
 talk actually you know I was very

2072
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:05,010
 

2073
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:07,170
 excited about your biological inspired

2074
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,170
 

2075
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:09,000
 work and I think you know there's a

2076
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,000
 

2077
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:10,950
 research area called synthetic biology

2078
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:10,950
 

2079
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,930
 and then people are trying to create

2080
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,930
 

2081
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:15,089
 actually you know people can create

2082
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,089
 

2083
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:17,310
 artificial cell from scratch and also

2084
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:17,310
 

2085
00:41:15,089 --> 00:41:19,230
 you know now if you attach electrodes to

2086
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,230
 

2087
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:21,240
 the small insects you can you know

2088
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,240
 

2089
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:23,250
 control the insects by sending a signal

2090
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:23,250
 

2091
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:25,349
 to them and also you know people are

2092
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,349
 

2093
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:27,869
 trying to create truly intelligent

2094
00:41:25,339 --> 00:41:27,869
 

2095
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:29,400
 robots right from Robotics perspectives

2096
00:41:27,859 --> 00:41:29,400
 

2097
00:41:27,869 --> 00:41:33,570
 and always in an algorithmic perspective

2098
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:33,570
 

2099
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:35,369
 so I'd like to know you're in a personal

2100
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,369
 

2101
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:37,920
 opinion about what is the correct

2102
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,920
 

2103
00:41:35,369 --> 00:41:40,140
 direction of true and creating truly

2104
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:40,140
 

2105
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,900
 intelligent agent or creatures or

2106
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:42,900
 

2107
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:45,200
 whatever I mean yeah all right well I

2108
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:45,200
 

2109
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:47,430
 could say a couple things we do have a

2110
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:47,430
 

2111
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,680
 section of my group it works on

2112
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,680
 

2113
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:51,119
 synthetic morphology so we have some

2114
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:51,119
 

2115
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,349
 really promising it's not published yet

2116
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:52,349
 

2117
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:54,420
 so I didn't bring it up here but there's

2118
00:41:52,339 --> 00:41:54,420
 

2119
00:41:52,349 --> 00:41:57,510
 the way we have some some pretty amazing

2120
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:57,510
 

2121
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:59,190
 new data on the ability of cells to

2122
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,190
 

2123
00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:01,619
 learn to cooperate in completely

2124
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:01,619
 

2125
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:03,480
 different configurations so you can make

2126
00:42:01,609 --> 00:42:03,480
 

2127
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:05,520
 artificial living machines that are

2128
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:05,520
 

2129
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,930
 nothing like the animal that from which

2130
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:06,930
 

2131
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,300
 they came and they're able to learn to

2132
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,300
 

2133
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:11,280
 cooperate and through some sort of a

2134
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:11,280
 

2135
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:12,930
 combination of emergence and guided

2136
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:12,930
 

2137
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,280
 self-assembly we can make some some

2138
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,280
 

2139
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:16,710
 machines that are just you know just

2140
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:16,710
 

2141
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:18,720
 amazing I think that's a very exciting

2142
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,720
 

2143
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:20,400
 exciting field of course the other thing

2144
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:20,400
 

2145
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,680
 that is really interesting is to try to

2146
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:22,680
 

2147
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:25,109
 extract some of the policies that cells

2148
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:25,109
 

2149
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:27,390
 and tissues use and try to implement

2150
00:42:25,099 --> 00:42:27,390
 

2151
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:29,520
 them either directly in the hardware or

2152
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:29,520
 

2153
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:30,720
 to bio interface so so we've done a

2154
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:30,720
 

2155
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:33,810
 little bit of that to is try to

2156
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:33,810
 

2157
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:35,220
 interface some you know the UM one of

2158
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,220
 

2159
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:38,099
 the one of the things I didn't bring up

2160
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:38,099
 

2161
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:40,140
 here for for lack of time is we found

2162
00:42:38,089 --> 00:42:40,140
 

2163
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:42,030
 out that if you if you make a tadpole

2164
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:42,030
 

2165
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:43,859
 where the eyes are on the tail instead

2166
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,859
 

2167
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:45,330
 of in the head those tadpoles can see

2168
00:42:43,849 --> 00:42:45,330
 

2169
00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:46,030
 out of that are those eyes perfectly

2170
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,030
 

2171
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:47,470
 well if

2172
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,470
 

2173
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:49,810
 the brain has you know for millions of

2174
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,810
 

2175
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:51,550
 years its benefits evolved to expect

2176
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,550
 

2177
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:52,780
 visual input from this region up in the

2178
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,780
 

2179
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:54,400
 head and all of a sudden now there's

2180
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,400
 

2181
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:55,540
 this weird itchy patch of tissue in the

2182
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:55,540
 

2183
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,070
 back that sort of sending you some

2184
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:57,070
 

2185
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:58,750
 signals the brain has no trouble

2186
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,750
 

2187
00:42:57,070 --> 00:43:00,700
 figuring out that that's visual data and

2188
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,700
 

2189
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:02,650
 being able to learn so those plasticity

2190
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:02,650
 

2191
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:04,360
 ziz is incredible and we need to we need

2192
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,360
 

2193
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:06,130
 to understand how this works and then I

2194
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:06,130
 

2195
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:08,040
 think I think the artifacts that we make

2196
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,040
 

2197
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:11,130
 are going to be just transformative

2198
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:11,130
 

2199
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:11,130
 thank you

2200
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:11,360
 

2201
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:17,220
 great talk yes do we know something

2202
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:17,220
 

2203
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:20,440
 about plants in terms of electrical

2204
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:20,440
 

2205
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:23,380
 signaling and also there is mechanical

2206
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:23,380
 

2207
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:24,820
 signaling which is very slow relatively

2208
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:24,820
 

2209
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:26,500
 slow so do you know anything about

2210
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,500
 

2211
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:29,560
 interactions between these different

2212
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:29,560
 

2213
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:31,540
 modes yeah great questions so plants yes

2214
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:31,540
 

2215
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:33,310
 my group doesn't work on plants but

2216
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:33,310
 

2217
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:36,280
 there's a couple of other labs that do

2218
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:36,280
 

2219
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:39,220
 and it's it's very interesting plants do

2220
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:39,220
 

2221
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:41,170
 very similar things with electrical

2222
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:41,170
 

2223
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:43,240
 signaling as a lot of what I showed you

2224
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,240
 

2225
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:44,770
 here is true in plants as well which is

2226
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:44,770
 

2227
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:46,480
 remarkable because plants and animals

2228
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,480
 

2229
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:48,010
 shared different origins of

2230
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:48,010
 

2231
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,930
 multicellularity right so they both

2232
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,930
 

2233
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:52,090
 discover this independently and that's

2234
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,090
 

2235
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:54,130
 because they're the ancestors even from

2236
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,130
 

2237
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:56,620
 bacteria so even bacterial biofilms

2238
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:56,620
 

2239
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:57,790
 propagate potassium waves that are brain

2240
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:57,790
 

2241
00:43:56,620 --> 00:44:00,130
 like and there's been some interesting

2242
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:00,130
 

2243
00:43:57,790 --> 00:44:01,960
 work on that so the decision-making for

2244
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,960
 

2245
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:03,490
 example in plant roots as they as they

2246
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:03,490
 

2247
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,840
 go through the soil and figure out where

2248
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,840
 

2249
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:07,570
 they're gonna go all the way through

2250
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:07,570
 

2251
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:09,490
 morphogenesis of the plant itself a lot

2252
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,490
 

2253
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:12,460
 of what I've said here it holds holds

2254
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,460
 

2255
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:14,560
 for plants as well mechanical forces

2256
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:14,560
 

2257
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:16,750
 yeah mechanical forces are absolutely

2258
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:16,750
 

2259
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:20,320
 also important in all of this and

2260
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:20,320
 

2261
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:22,570
 mechanics interacts tightly with bio

2262
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:22,570
 

2263
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:24,490
 electrics there are stretch and

2264
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,490
 

2265
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:26,170
 pressure-sensitive ion channels so they

2266
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,170
 

2267
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:27,970
 will convert mechanical forces into

2268
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,970
 

2269
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:29,890
 electrical forces and there are proteins

2270
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,890
 

2271
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:31,690
 that do the reverse that basically under

2272
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,690
 

2273
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:34,510
 electrical gradients across the membrane

2274
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,510
 

2275
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:36,730
 they will exert stress and strain so so

2276
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,730
 

2277
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:38,800
 those systems interact also of course

2278
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,800
 

2279
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:40,840
 both of them interact with more familiar

2280
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:40,840
 

2281
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:43,240
 genetic and biochemical signaling and so

2282
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:43,240
 

2283
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:47,260
 these are three pieces of the puzzle and

2284
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:47,260
 

2285
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:48,670
 the whole system is kind of this this

2286
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:48,670
 

2287
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:50,530
 dynamical system where all of these

2288
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,530
 

2289
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:52,330
 things constantly interact the one

2290
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,330
 

2291
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:55,000
 question that we always ask ourselves is

2292
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:55,000
 

2293
00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:57,340
 at what point in that control structure

2294
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:57,340
 

2295
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,080
 is it most efficient to intervene so

2296
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:59,080
 

2297
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:59,599
 right now the majority of my colleagues

2298
00:44:59,070 --> 00:44:59,599
 

2299
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,549
 are

2300
00:44:59,589 --> 00:45:01,549
 

2301
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:03,079
 working on biochemistry and genetics so

2302
00:45:01,539 --> 00:45:03,079
 

2303
00:45:01,549 --> 00:45:04,430
 so they're intervening at the molecular

2304
00:45:03,069 --> 00:45:04,430
 

2305
00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:07,609
 level so they're looking for growth

2306
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:07,609
 

2307
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:09,619
 factors and diffusible signals what we

2308
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:09,619
 

2309
00:45:07,609 --> 00:45:11,450
 have seen is that intervening in the

2310
00:45:09,609 --> 00:45:11,450
 

2311
00:45:09,619 --> 00:45:13,460
 electrical level gives extremely

2312
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,460
 

2313
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:15,890
 efficient control so if you want an eye

2314
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:15,890
 

2315
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:17,660
 you can try to assemble it cell by cell

2316
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,660
 

2317
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:19,579
 but it's really much more efficient to

2318
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:19,579
 

2319
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:21,739
 trigger the whole the whole subroutine

2320
00:45:19,569 --> 00:45:21,739
 

2321
00:45:19,579 --> 00:45:23,299
 as it were and so I think that a lot of

2322
00:45:21,729 --> 00:45:23,299
 

2323
00:45:21,739 --> 00:45:24,859
 the important decisions are made at the

2324
00:45:23,289 --> 00:45:24,859
 

2325
00:45:23,299 --> 00:45:28,190
 electrical level but it's absolutely

2326
00:45:24,849 --> 00:45:28,190
 

2327
00:45:24,859 --> 00:45:30,229
 true that mechanical forces and did you

2328
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:30,229
 

2329
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:32,539
 know transcriptional and chemical

2330
00:45:30,219 --> 00:45:32,539
 

2331
00:45:30,229 --> 00:45:34,339
 networks are downstream as part of how

2332
00:45:32,529 --> 00:45:34,339
 

2333
00:45:32,539 --> 00:45:39,229
 this stuff gets executed in the actual

2334
00:45:34,329 --> 00:45:39,229
 

2335
00:45:34,339 --> 00:45:41,989
 tissue hi thank you for your talk it was

2336
00:45:39,219 --> 00:45:41,989
 

2337
00:45:39,229 --> 00:45:45,890
 very fascinating so you talked a lot

2338
00:45:41,979 --> 00:45:45,890
 

2339
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:47,299
 about how on-like cells that regenerate

2340
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,299
 

2341
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:48,950
 limbs are making some sort of decision

2342
00:45:47,289 --> 00:45:48,950
 

2343
00:45:47,299 --> 00:45:51,109
 and you said that plant roots they make

2344
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:51,109
 

2345
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:53,930
 decisions as they navigate through the

2346
00:45:51,099 --> 00:45:53,930
 

2347
00:45:51,109 --> 00:45:55,700
 ground and somewhere on a higher level

2348
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,700
 

2349
00:45:53,930 --> 00:45:57,470
 we also make decisions in our brain so

2350
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:57,470
 

2351
00:45:55,700 --> 00:46:00,019
 somewhere between there this thing

2352
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:00,019
 

2353
00:45:57,470 --> 00:46:02,809
 called consciousness arises is there any

2354
00:46:00,009 --> 00:46:02,809
 

2355
00:46:00,019 --> 00:46:06,819
 sort of real definition of consciousness

2356
00:46:02,799 --> 00:46:06,819
 

2357
00:46:02,809 --> 00:46:09,769
 and if so is it a gradient is it a line

2358
00:46:06,809 --> 00:46:09,769
 

2359
00:46:06,819 --> 00:46:11,930
 dude can you speak to that at all yeah

2360
00:46:09,759 --> 00:46:11,930
 

2361
00:46:09,769 --> 00:46:13,849
 III get into enough trouble talking

2362
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,849
 

2363
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:16,009
 about decision making at the level of

2364
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:16,009
 

2365
00:46:13,849 --> 00:46:17,900
 cells so I don't think I'm gonna void

2366
00:46:15,999 --> 00:46:17,900
 

2367
00:46:16,009 --> 00:46:19,009
 opinion on cautiousness per se because

2368
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:19,009
 

2369
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:21,289
 there's a lot of people that work on

2370
00:46:18,999 --> 00:46:21,289
 

2371
00:46:19,009 --> 00:46:23,180
 this and argue about that stuff but I

2372
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:23,180
 

2373
00:46:21,289 --> 00:46:25,579
 will say that there is there is an

2374
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:25,579
 

2375
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:27,259
 emerging field of basal cognition and

2376
00:46:25,569 --> 00:46:27,259
 

2377
00:46:25,579 --> 00:46:29,809
 these are groups of people that talk

2378
00:46:27,249 --> 00:46:29,809
 

2379
00:46:27,259 --> 00:46:31,789
 that talk about memory learning sensing

2380
00:46:29,799 --> 00:46:31,789
 

2381
00:46:29,809 --> 00:46:34,339
 creativity all the kinds of things all

2382
00:46:31,779 --> 00:46:34,339
 

2383
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:36,979
 the way from bacteria plants animals

2384
00:46:34,329 --> 00:46:36,979
 

2385
00:46:34,339 --> 00:46:38,690
 cells and in fact even group colonial

2386
00:46:36,969 --> 00:46:38,690
 

2387
00:46:36,979 --> 00:46:39,829
 organisms like ant hills you know there

2388
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:39,829
 

2389
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:41,210
 are things that an anthill knows that

2390
00:46:39,819 --> 00:46:41,210
 

2391
00:46:39,829 --> 00:46:42,499
 the individual ants don't know and so on

2392
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,499
 

2393
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:44,059
 so there's lots of people that worry

2394
00:46:42,489 --> 00:46:44,059
 

2395
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:45,799
 about that kind of stuff and and we

2396
00:46:44,049 --> 00:46:45,799
 

2397
00:46:44,059 --> 00:46:47,569
 discuss all these things at meetings so

2398
00:46:45,789 --> 00:46:47,569
 

2399
00:46:45,799 --> 00:46:49,130
 I don't think I'm haven't even profound

2400
00:46:47,559 --> 00:46:49,130
 

2401
00:46:47,569 --> 00:46:51,529
 to say specifically about consciousness

2402
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,529
 

2403
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:53,239
 but I do feel very strongly that all of

2404
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:53,239
 

2405
00:46:51,529 --> 00:46:55,460
 this is a continuum that there is

2406
00:46:53,229 --> 00:46:55,460
 

2407
00:46:53,239 --> 00:46:56,749
 nothing radically special about it

2408
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:56,749
 

2409
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:58,880
 there's a lot of people that feel that

2410
00:46:56,739 --> 00:46:58,880
 

2411
00:46:56,749 --> 00:47:00,380
 some of these terms should be left sort

2412
00:46:58,870 --> 00:47:00,380
 

2413
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,180
 of exclusively in the realm of human

2414
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:02,180
 

2415
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:03,650
 psychology and I think that's a profound

2416
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:03,650
 

2417
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:05,660
 mistake I think that's a that's a

2418
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,660
 

2419
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:08,359
 mistake both on evolutionary grounds and

2420
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:08,359
 

2421
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:10,039
 you know just in there is no principled

2422
00:47:08,349 --> 00:47:10,039
 

2423
00:47:08,359 --> 00:47:11,570
 distinction there are only shades of the

2424
00:47:10,029 --> 00:47:11,570
 

2425
00:47:10,039 --> 00:47:12,890
 shades of quantitative difference

2426
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:12,890
 

2427
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:15,530
 and so you can see things like

2428
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,530
 

2429
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:17,210
 anticipation yeast can anticipate you

2430
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,210
 

2431
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:18,920
 know yeast can learn simple patterns and

2432
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,920
 

2433
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:20,720
 they'll anticipate to them there these

2434
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:20,720
 

2435
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:22,430
 things go all the way down to the to the

2436
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:22,430
 

2437
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:24,290
 very base of the Tree of Life and so

2438
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:24,290
 

2439
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:26,030
 what you're gonna call is consciousness

2440
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,030
 

2441
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:27,890
 I mean I have I have a very good

2442
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:27,890
 

2443
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:30,170
 colleague who thinks that cautious of

2444
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,170
 

2445
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:32,300
 consciousness appears when something she

2446
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,300
 

2447
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:33,860
 calls you al unlimited associative

2448
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:33,860
 

2449
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:35,510
 learning takes place and there are only

2450
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:35,510
 

2451
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:38,150
 some organisms that are able to carry

2452
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:38,150
 

2453
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:39,680
 out a kind of generic associative

2454
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:39,680
 

2455
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:41,480
 learning and and some organisms cannot

2456
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:41,480
 

2457
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:43,220
 and that's where she puts the line I'm

2458
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:43,220
 

2459
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:44,870
 not sure I think it's as reasonable as

2460
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:44,870
 

2461
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:46,850
 anything else but for sure it's a

2462
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:46,850
 

2463
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:48,770
 continuum and whether it's consciousness

2464
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,770
 

2465
00:47:46,850 --> 00:47:50,140
 or just functional cognitive abilities

2466
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,140
 

2467
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:55,730
 they go all the way to the beginning

2468
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:55,730
 

2469
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:59,840
 thanks very much I was amazed by your

2470
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:59,840
 

2471
00:47:55,730 --> 00:48:01,940
 talk when you apply these frequencies or

2472
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:01,940
 

2473
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:03,590
 this electronical signal how do you do

2474
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:03,590
 

2475
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:05,390
 that do you put in just like an

2476
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,390
 

2477
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:07,610
 electrode into something or are you

2478
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:07,610
 

2479
00:48:05,390 --> 00:48:09,560
 poking it with something and what is the

2480
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,560
 

2481
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:11,540
 time frame that these signals need to be

2482
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:11,540
 

2483
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:12,230
 applied right time frame that's an

2484
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:12,230
 

2485
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:15,230
 important question

2486
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:15,230
 

2487
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:17,180
 so under and we never apply any

2488
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:17,180
 

2489
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:19,160
 electrical fields we have no electrodes

2490
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:19,160
 

2491
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:21,170
 we apply no electrical fields and we

2492
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:21,170
 

2493
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:24,430
 don't do anything with frequencies what

2494
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:24,430
 

2495
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:27,680
 we try to do is to alter the endogenous

2496
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:27,680
 

2497
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:30,410
 state of resting potential across cells

2498
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:30,410
 

2499
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:32,000
 and the way we do that is we target the

2500
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,000
 

2501
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:34,340
 ion channel proteins that are

2502
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:34,340
 

2503
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,620
 endogenously expressed in these cells we

2504
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:36,620
 

2505
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:39,230
 either close them we open them and we

2506
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:39,230
 

2507
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:40,610
 thus affect the electrical state so this

2508
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:40,610
 

2509
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:42,380
 is done either genetically or

2510
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,380
 

2511
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:44,300
 pharmacologically in the case of our

2512
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:44,300
 

2513
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:46,430
 regenerative medicine applications is

2514
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:46,430
 

2515
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:48,410
 with drugs small molecule drugs but we

2516
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:48,410
 

2517
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:49,610
 can in let's say in tadpoles with you

2518
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,610
 

2519
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:51,080
 know a really nice way to do it as

2520
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,080
 

2521
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:52,670
 optogenetics you put in something like

2522
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:52,670
 

2523
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:54,530
 channelrhodopsin and then you shine a

2524
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:54,530
 

2525
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:56,270
 light and and the pattern of the light

2526
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,270
 

2527
00:48:54,530 --> 00:48:57,830
 can tell it can really you can you can

2528
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:57,830
 

2529
00:48:56,270 --> 00:49:00,020
 really have pretty fine control over

2530
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:00,020
 

2531
00:48:57,830 --> 00:49:02,480
 where the electrical states go the

2532
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:02,480
 

2533
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:06,200
 timescale is really critical because a

2534
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:06,200
 

2535
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:08,390
 lot of the types of effects that I've

2536
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:08,390
 

2537
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:10,070
 shown you are literally triggers to

2538
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:10,070
 

2539
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:12,260
 these what we call the subroutine calls

2540
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:12,260
 

2541
00:49:10,070 --> 00:49:14,240
 right of patterning the time that you

2542
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:14,240
 

2543
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:17,570
 have to do it is incredibly short so in

2544
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:17,570
 

2545
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:20,390
 the frog leg we treat the wound we treat

2546
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:20,390
 

2547
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:23,060
 the amputation wound for 24 hours that

2548
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:23,060
 

2549
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:25,280
 gives you nine months of leg growth so

2550
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:25,280
 

2551
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:26,780
 after the first 24 hours you walk

2552
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:26,780
 

2553
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,820
 you never touch it again and the whole

2554
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:28,820
 

2555
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:30,440
 thing goes for 24 hours you could

2556
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:30,440
 

2557
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:31,880
 intervene at different steps of the wave

2558
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:31,880
 

2559
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:33,560
 instead of a frog-leg you wanted

2560
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:33,560
 

2561
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,940
 something else you could go in and try

2562
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:34,940
 

2563
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:36,320
 to make it do something else and we're

2564
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,320
 

2565
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:38,120
 certainly working on that as a way to

2566
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:38,120
 

2567
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:40,670
 understand what's happening but the

2568
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:40,670
 

2569
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:43,010
 treatments are often incredibly brief

2570
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:43,010
 

2571
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:44,690
 because these one of the properties of

2572
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,690
 

2573
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:46,940
 these electrical circuits is they have

2574
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,940
 

2575
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:48,560
 these stable attractors that once you

2576
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:48,560
 

2577
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:50,120
 knock them into that sort of

2578
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:50,120
 

2579
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:51,170
 neighborhood of the state space you

2580
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:51,170
 

2581
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,760
 don't need to hold them there they're

2582
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,760
 

2583
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:54,500
 gonna they're gonna maintain state and

2584
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:54,500
 

2585
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:56,450
 so our goal is to map out all of these

2586
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:56,450
 

2587
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:58,490
 things to understand what is the minimum

2588
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,490
 

2589
00:49:56,450 --> 00:50:03,440
 we can do to get the maximum outcome

2590
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:03,440
 

2591
00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:06,680
 thank you hi could you talk more about

2592
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:06,680
 

2593
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:08,810
 these new architectures these non neural

2594
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,810
 

2595
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:11,120
 architectures and what would that get us

2596
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,120
 

2597
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:13,910
 would we have more compositional systems

2598
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:13,910
 

2599
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:16,550
 more flexible ones things that don't

2600
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:16,550
 

2601
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:18,590
 just think but also feel or even look at

2602
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:18,590
 

2603
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:22,100
 testbed for designing new organisms or

2604
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:22,100
 

2605
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:24,080
 new like use that to design biology yeah

2606
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:24,080
 

2607
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:25,670
 I think I think what it's going to get

2608
00:50:24,070 --> 00:50:25,670
 

2609
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:28,220
 us I don't know if it's going to get us

2610
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:28,220
 

2611
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:29,450
 systems that feel and and how we would

2612
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:29,450
 

2613
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:32,090
 know if they did that's a whole other

2614
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,090
 

2615
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:34,160
 sort of kettle of fish but I what I

2616
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,160
 

2617
00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:37,010
 think it's going to get us is much more

2618
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:37,010
 

2619
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:38,510
 robust adaptive systems one of the

2620
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,510
 

2621
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:43,430
 things that biological systems are

2622
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:43,430
 

2623
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:45,170
 really good at is adaptively adjusting

2624
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:45,170
 

2625
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:46,490
 to very novel environments and so I

2626
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,490
 

2627
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:48,050
 think one of the problems that we have

2628
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,050
 

2629
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:49,520
 in this field and you guys can correct

2630
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,520
 

2631
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:51,770
 me if I'm wrong but I think that one of

2632
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:51,770
 

2633
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:53,120
 the problems we have is that systems

2634
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,120
 

2635
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:55,220
 that are very good at one particular

2636
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:55,220
 

2637
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:56,990
 task often are not that great when you

2638
00:50:55,210 --> 00:50:56,990
 

2639
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:59,450
 shift it to it to a different task

2640
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:59,450
 

2641
00:50:56,990 --> 00:51:01,610
 biology isn't like that these these

2642
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,610
 

2643
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:03,500
 cells are and these or tissues are

2644
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,500
 

2645
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:05,900
 incredibly good at dealing with with

2646
00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:05,900
 

2647
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:09,010
 very novel scenarios in an adaptive way

2648
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:09,010
 

2649
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:11,870
 and well one of the differences between

2650
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,870
 

2651
00:51:09,010 --> 00:51:13,160
 biological structures and and the kinds

2652
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,160
 

2653
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:15,320
 of artifacts that I've seen people make

2654
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:15,320
 

2655
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:16,640
 is that biology as competency at every

2656
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:16,640
 

2657
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:19,040
 level so the individual molecular

2658
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:19,040
 

2659
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:20,810
 networks have memory and flexibility the

2660
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:20,810
 

2661
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:22,790
 cells do the tissues do the organs do

2662
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,790
 

2663
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:24,050
 every level has its own competency so

2664
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:24,050
 

2665
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:26,750
 you're building things out of very

2666
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,750
 

2667
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:28,130
 intelligent components and their various

2668
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:28,130
 

2669
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:30,080
 other things that we can talk about it

2670
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:30,080
 

2671
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:32,080
 you know at length but I think what it's

2672
00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:32,080
 

2673
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:35,660
 going to get us is systems that are

2674
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:35,660
 

2675
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:37,820
 fundamentally good at pursuing goals in

2676
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:37,820
 

2677
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:39,350
 the light of an unfriendly environment

2678
00:51:37,810 --> 00:51:39,350
 

2679
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:40,910
 that's what that's what all of lie

2680
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:40,910
 

2681
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:42,800
 right these biological systems have very

2682
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:42,800
 

2683
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:44,600
 specific goals the environment throws

2684
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:44,600
 

2685
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:47,510
 all kinds of crazy scenarios at them and

2686
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:47,510
 

2687
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:49,160
 they are really good at navigating all

2688
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,160
 

2689
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:50,750
 of that and I think we don't really know

2690
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:50,750
 

2691
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:53,960
 how to do that so that's what we'll get

2692
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:53,960
 

2693
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:56,480
 and one more do you have any sketch of

2694
00:51:53,950 --> 00:51:56,480
 

2695
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:58,220
 how we would build such a thing I have I

2696
00:51:56,470 --> 00:51:58,220
 

2697
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,330
 have many ideas on how we should try and

2698
00:51:58,210 --> 00:51:59,330
 

2699
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:04,730
 so I'm happy to talk to you afterwards

2700
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:04,730
 

2701
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:05,990
 and talk details thank you hi I found

2702
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:05,990
 

2703
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:09,320
 this is an absolutely incredible talk

2704
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:09,320
 

2705
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:10,520
 and one thing that that came to mind

2706
00:52:09,310 --> 00:52:10,520
 

2707
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:13,040
 when I was thinking about this talk was

2708
00:52:10,510 --> 00:52:13,040
 

2709
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:14,780
 ethical concerns seems like when you're

2710
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:14,780
 

2711
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:16,250
 working with like small animals doesn't

2712
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:16,250
 

2713
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:18,320
 really matter but when you start getting

2714
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,320
 

2715
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:21,980
 into humans and doing things that could

2716
00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:21,980
 

2717
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:23,240
 potentially have really systemic effects

2718
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:23,240
 

2719
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:24,860
 in them that they're that people may

2720
00:52:23,230 --> 00:52:24,860
 

2721
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:26,030
 start objecting to that and I'm

2722
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,030
 

2723
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:28,130
 wondering if you have thoughts about how

2724
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:28,130
 

2725
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:30,890
 to head off those ethical concerns sure

2726
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:30,890
 

2727
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:32,720
 yeah good question I I can say a couple

2728
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,720
 

2729
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:35,840
 of things I think that on the one hand

2730
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:35,840
 

2731
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:37,970
 I'll point out that in terms of in terms

2732
00:52:35,830 --> 00:52:37,970
 

2733
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:40,190
 of ethical ethical concerns the kinds of

2734
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,190
 

2735
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:42,530
 things that I've been talking about here

2736
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:42,530
 

2737
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:44,270
 are way low on the list of compared to

2738
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,270
 

2739
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:45,830
 competing technologies that are already

2740
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:45,830
 

2741
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:47,180
 out there so people that are doing

2742
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:47,180
 

2743
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:49,580
 genomic editing people that are doing

2744
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:49,580
 

2745
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:52,040
 infectious disease research you know

2746
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:52,040
 

2747
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:53,600
 creating novel viruses and I mean the

2748
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:53,600
 

2749
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:56,150
 stuff that's that's being done is is

2750
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:56,150
 

2751
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:57,680
 like you know way beyond anything we're

2752
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:57,680
 

2753
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:59,240
 talking about here and in fact on that

2754
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:59,240
 

2755
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:01,130
 scale this is actually fairly subtle

2756
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:01,130
 

2757
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:02,870
 because what I'm specifically saying is

2758
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,870
 

2759
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:04,370
 I think we can develop a strategy for

2760
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:04,370
 

2761
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:07,040
 regenerative medicine that does not

2762
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:07,040
 

2763
00:53:04,370 --> 00:53:11,030
 require manipulating the genome it does

2764
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:11,030
 

2765
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:12,830
 not require any kind of viral delivery

2766
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:12,830
 

2767
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:15,020
 vectors are all this so I think I think

2768
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:15,020
 

2769
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:17,450
 I think there are way bigger problems in

2770
00:53:15,010 --> 00:53:17,450
 

2771
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:18,650
 in the field and then what then what you

2772
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,650
 

2773
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:21,080
 know then what we're doing in terms of

2774
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:21,080
 

2775
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:22,870
 in terms of ethics all right well thanks

2776
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:22,870
 

2777
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:27,040
 very much

2778
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:27,040
 

2779
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:30,500
 hi so ml community has done some work in

2780
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:30,500
 

2781
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:33,770
 mimicking signal transduction networks

2782
00:53:30,490 --> 00:53:33,770
 

2783
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:35,720
 particularly in t-cells or immune cells

2784
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,720
 

2785
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:38,270
 in general and so I'm curious if you can

2786
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:38,270
 

2787
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:40,760
 help me understand what the relationship

2788
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:40,760
 

2789
00:53:38,270 --> 00:53:43,040
 between some of these ion channel based

2790
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:43,040
 

2791
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:44,410
 networks and signal transduction

2792
00:53:43,030 --> 00:53:44,410
 

2793
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:46,180
 networks are

2794
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,180
 

2795
00:53:44,410 --> 00:53:50,619
 and how that kind of ties into the AI

2796
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:50,619
 

2797
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:51,970
 theme and secondly so the assistant the

2798
00:53:50,609 --> 00:53:51,970
 

2799
00:53:50,619 --> 00:53:54,809
 computational assistants biology

2800
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,809
 

2801
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:56,710
 community has kind of developed a lot of

2802
00:53:54,799 --> 00:53:56,710
 

2803
00:53:54,809 --> 00:53:58,750
 computational models of this type of

2804
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:58,750
 

2805
00:53:56,710 --> 00:54:00,190
 things so weight rating from OD e based

2806
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:00,190
 

2807
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:02,500
 networks to partial differential

2808
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:02,500
 

2809
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:04,299
 equations to like boolean networks time

2810
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:04,299
 

2811
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:07,089
 to scale those up to a whole host cell

2812
00:54:04,289 --> 00:54:07,089
 

2813
00:54:04,299 --> 00:54:08,200
 models does that relate to what you're

2814
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:08,200
 

2815
00:54:07,089 --> 00:54:10,390
 talking about here in terms is AI

2816
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:10,390
 

2817
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:12,430
 platform for non neural architectures

2818
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,430
 

2819
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:15,190
 and relationships are you doing any of

2820
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:15,190
 

2821
00:54:12,430 --> 00:54:17,890
 that in your lab it's yeah it's related

2822
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:17,890
 

2823
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:19,630
 that that's actually a very kind of

2824
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,630
 

2825
00:54:17,890 --> 00:54:24,549
 lengthy question it sounds like we

2826
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:24,549
 

2827
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:25,809
 should take that up okay yeah I think we

2828
00:54:24,539 --> 00:54:25,809
 

2829
00:54:24,549 --> 00:54:27,099
 can talk about that at length that

2830
00:54:25,799 --> 00:54:27,099
 

2831
00:54:25,809 --> 00:54:28,660
 that's that that'll take a pretty

2832
00:54:27,089 --> 00:54:28,660
 

2833
00:54:27,099 --> 00:54:33,779
 lengthy a pretty lengthy answer I'm very

2834
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:33,779
 

2835
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:38,079
 happy to talk to you about it it's high

2836
00:54:33,769 --> 00:54:38,079
 

2837
00:54:33,779 --> 00:54:40,630
 rated question there is a long history

2838
00:54:38,069 --> 00:54:40,630
 

2839
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:43,480
 of reaction diffusion models for

2840
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:43,480
 

2841
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:46,450
 patterning and so I was wondering if

2842
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:46,450
 

2843
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:48,430
 it's a mechanism you and to some extent

2844
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,430
 

2845
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:51,490
 it has been confirmed with BMP signaling

2846
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:51,490
 

2847
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:53,740
 in limb bones so I was wondering what is

2848
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,740
 

2849
00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:55,390
 your view of the interaction of this

2850
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:55,390
 

2851
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:57,430
 electrical system with a reaction

2852
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:57,430
 

2853
00:54:55,390 --> 00:54:59,589
 different system is it upstream is it

2854
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:59,589
 

2855
00:54:57,430 --> 00:55:02,230
 interfering with it is it the reaction

2856
00:54:59,579 --> 00:55:02,230
 

2857
00:54:59,589 --> 00:55:04,509
 diffusion system itself yeah so so two

2858
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:04,509
 

2859
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:06,099
 things we as far as we can tell right

2860
00:55:04,499 --> 00:55:06,099
 

2861
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:08,910
 now in the cases that we've looked at it

2862
00:55:06,089 --> 00:55:08,910
 

2863
00:55:06,099 --> 00:55:12,160
 is upstream so it helps control the

2864
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:12,160
 

2865
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:16,000
 downstream are the systems for chemical

2866
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:16,000
 

2867
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:17,319
 morphogens and as far as what was the

2868
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:17,319
 

2869
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:21,700
 other sorry what was the second question

2870
00:55:17,309 --> 00:55:21,700
 

2871
00:55:17,319 --> 00:55:23,589
 I was reaction diffusion system by

2872
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:23,589
 

2873
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:25,000
 itself yeah yeah actually that's true

2874
00:55:23,579 --> 00:55:25,000
 

2875
00:55:23,589 --> 00:55:26,859
 too so so one of the really interesting

2876
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:26,859
 

2877
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,960
 things about like these kind of

2878
00:55:26,849 --> 00:55:28,960
 

2879
00:55:26,859 --> 00:55:31,059
 electrical networks is that when there

2880
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:31,059
 

2881
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:33,220
 spatialized and distributed over a group

2882
00:55:31,049 --> 00:55:33,220
 

2883
00:55:31,059 --> 00:55:35,049
 of cells they themselves purely at the

2884
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:35,049
 

2885
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:37,029
 electrical level with no transcriptional

2886
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:37,029
 

2887
00:55:35,049 --> 00:55:38,440
 changes underneath can do spontaneous

2888
00:55:37,019 --> 00:55:38,440
 

2889
00:55:37,029 --> 00:55:40,150
 symmetry breaking and touring like

2890
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:40,150
 

2891
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:43,589
 patterns so that's that's absolutely

2892
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:43,589
 

2893
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:46,720
 true as well okay thank you thank you

2894
00:55:43,579 --> 00:55:46,720
 

2895
00:55:43,589 --> 00:55:50,250
 thank you thank you everyone for all the

2896
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:50,250
 

2897
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:50,250
 great questions and thank Michael Evan

2898
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:50,520
 

2899
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:57,270
