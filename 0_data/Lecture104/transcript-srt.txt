1
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:53,350
 you

2
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:04,730
 

3
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:08,370
 and the main idea in these sorts of

4
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,370
 

5
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:11,610
 algorithms is to maintain a perrito

6
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,610
 

7
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:15,840
 front of non dominated solutions so for

8
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,840
 

9
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:17,070
 example a is better than B only if a it

10
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,070
 

11
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,200
 scores better than B on all the

12
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,200
 

13
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:20,610
 different objectives and so this is kind

14
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,610
 

15
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,900
 of another interesting possibility

16
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,900
 

17
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:23,280
 enable by maintaining a population that

18
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,280
 

19
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:28,350
 you kind of have this population that

20
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:28,350
 

21
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:30,120
 spreads across this front but although

22
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,120
 

23
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:32,490
 that's really interesting there's some

24
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,490
 

25
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:34,560
 problems with combining novelty and the

26
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,560
 

27
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:35,700
 pressure achieve in this way which you

28
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,700
 

29
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,890
 might consider there's some sort of

30
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,890
 

31
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:40,830
 global competition in this in the system

32
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,830
 

33
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:42,270
 that no matter how novel you are on the

34
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,270
 

35
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:43,980
 one side on the other side of the

36
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,980
 

37
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:45,660
 predefined you're always going to push

38
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:45,660
 

39
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,340
 on the highest objective scores which

40
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,340
 

41
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:49,640
 could be pushing you into this deceptive

42
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,640
 

43
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,640
 regime

44
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:19,270
 

45
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:24,160
 then a population

46
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,160
 

47
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:25,150
 could help us to instantiate sometimes

48
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,150
 

49
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,920
 we care about is finding the best

50
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,920
 

51
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:28,270
 possible example of each achievable

52
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,270
 

53
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:31,980
 behavior we're not looking for just the

54
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,980
 

55
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:34,030
 sole optimal thing and this allows us to

56
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:34,030
 

57
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:36,040
 so one thing this could it could enable

58
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,040
 

59
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:37,660
 is to build a replica are of different

60
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,660
 

61
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,100
 ways to solve a problem so it's a

62
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:39,100
 

63
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:40,840
 different kind of search problem it

64
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,840
 

65
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,460
 could highlight for example a wide range

66
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,460
 

67
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,020
 of possible designs that the designer

68
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,020
 

69
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:45,910
 could later choose from it could enable

70
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,910
 

71
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:47,680
 a robot to adapt new circumstances Jeff

72
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,680
 

73
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:49,300
 we'll talk about that later or can

74
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,300
 

75
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,440
 circumvent its deception like we were

76
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:50,440
 

77
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:52,000
 talking about and originally but I could

78
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:52,000
 

79
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,070
 be creating an implicit curriculum where

80
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:54,070
 

81
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,390
 solutions in one what the simplest kinds

82
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,390
 

83
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:56,680
 of solutions could lead to more

84
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,680
 

85
00:21:55,390 --> 00:22:00,820
 complicated ones and we'll talk about

86
00:21:56,670 --> 00:22:00,820
 

87
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:01,900
 that later as well so sometimes the

88
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:01,900
 

89
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,460
 subject of performance now is not the

90
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:03,460
 

91
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,990
 most important factor so that's kind of

92
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:04,990
 

93
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:06,850
 maybe a little bit heretical to say but

94
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,850
 

95
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,530
 might as search designers might actually

96
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,530
 

97
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:09,850
 have other aims for our search we might

98
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,850
 

99
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:12,040
 want to illuminate this face of diverse

100
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,040
 

101
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:13,600
 possible solutions and sometimes

102
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,600
 

103
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,400
 diversity and how a problem is solved

104
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,400
 

105
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,960
 can be more important than finding only

106
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:16,960
 

107
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,400
 the single most efficient solutions so

108
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,400
 

109
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,010
 going to this biological example

110
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:21,010
 

111
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,380
 bacteria reproduced in 20 minutes bears

112
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,380
 

113
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:25,360
 in three years so if they were compared

114
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:25,360
 

115
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:27,340
 globally they would look sort of really

116
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,340
 

117
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,720
 unbalanced but we maybe care about both

118
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:28,720
 

119
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:30,610
 of those for their own sake and actually

120
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,610
 

121
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,150
 from human if we might find bears more

122
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,150
 

123
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:35,710
 interesting so to make this point in

124
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,710
 

125
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:37,930
 another sort of thought experiment

126
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,930
 

127
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:40,330
 domain we can consider a domain of

128
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,330
 

129
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:42,010
 what's called virtual creatures and here

130
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,010
 

131
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:43,840
 the idea is to optimize both the

132
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,840
 

133
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:45,490
 morphology and the controller of a

134
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,490
 

135
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,880
 virtual robot so not only what the robot

136
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,880
 

137
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:50,800
 does but the structure of it which is an

138
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:50,800
 

139
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,210
 interesting kind of search and we could

140
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,210
 

141
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,520
 from a cutey perspective the quality of

142
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,520
 

143
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:56,440
 versity perspective we could ask what if

144
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,440
 

145
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:58,560
 we wanted to have our population span

146
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:58,560
 

147
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,030
 the best possible locomotion strategies

148
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:01,030
 

149
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:05,280
 given all areas of morphology space to

150
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:05,280
 

151
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:07,870
 see for example how a small high mass

152
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:07,870
 

153
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:10,630
 robot was able to locate versus a very

154
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,630
 

155
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:13,090
 tall low mass robot and this leads to

156
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,090
 

157
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:16,060
 the idea of not only search local

158
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,060
 

159
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:17,470
 competition and so here we'll be talking

160
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:17,470
 

161
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:20,020
 about diversity in the space and

162
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:20,020
 

163
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:21,880
 morphologies and performance as terms of

164
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:21,880
 

165
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,810
 the ability to locomote just as a kind

166
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:22,810
 

167
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,360
 of proxy for things we'll be talking

168
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,360
 

169
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:27,610
 about later so in global competition

170
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,610
 

171
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,740
 which is the idea that we start out with

172
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,740
 

173
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:31,570
 here with its pre o front we'll just use

174
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:31,570
 

175
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:34,930
 absolute fitness absolute objective

176
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,930
 

177
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:35,660
 scores for these different locomoting

178
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,660
 

179
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:37,160
 robots

180
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,160
 

181
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:38,330
 and they'll compete globally on this

182
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,330
 

183
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,190
 absolute performance measure and we

184
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,190
 

185
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:42,980
 think that we'll probably concentrate

186
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,980
 

187
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:47,480
 resources on just the best Nicias like

188
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:47,480
 

189
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:49,549
 the the cheetah like robots for example

190
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:49,549
 

191
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:51,470
 but if we use instead a local

192
00:23:49,539 --> 00:23:51,470
 

193
00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:56,090
 competition objective objective where we

194
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:56,090
 

195
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:57,350
 we are rewarding individuals and Nicias

196
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,350
 

197
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:59,660
 and I say Nisshin basically means sort

198
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,660
 

199
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:01,940
 of like a way of life or our dial of

200
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,940
 

201
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:03,200
 solution they're going to be explored

202
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:03,200
 

203
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,490
 relative to their local capacity

204
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,490
 

205
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,809
 performance so we'll see the best

206
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,809
 

207
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:07,580
 version of a bacteria the best version

208
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:07,580
 

209
00:24:05,809 --> 00:24:09,080
 of bear and we do that by just counting

210
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,080
 

211
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:11,840
 how many of your morphological nearest

212
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:11,840
 

213
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,340
 neighbors you got perform so basically

214
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,340
 

215
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,900
 this involves just revisiting that

216
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:14,900
 

217
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:16,580
 previous graph where we just have this

218
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:16,580
 

219
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,710
 pre doe based search and we have local

220
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:18,710
 

221
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,750
 competition on the on the XS now instead

222
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,750
 

223
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:23,260
 of a global competition score and so if

224
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:23,260
 

225
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:25,700
 we run the algorithm what we get is

226
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,700
 

227
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:29,870
 novelty driven search we'll just kind of

228
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:29,870
 

229
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:32,000
 find here darker darker individuals are

230
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:32,000
 

231
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:33,409
 higher performing and lighter

232
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,409
 

233
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,460
 individuals are serve worse performing

234
00:24:33,399 --> 00:24:34,460
 

235
00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:36,710
 and these dots are in the morphology

236
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:36,710
 

237
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:39,350
 space the basic point here is that nolle

238
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,350
 

239
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:40,610
 search finds really diverse morphologies

240
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,610
 

241
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:43,010
 they don't do anything the objective

242
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,010
 

243
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:44,990
 based search finds very concentrated

244
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,990
 

245
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:46,820
 pockets of high-performing things in the

246
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,820
 

247
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:48,409
 makita space global competition kind of

248
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,409
 

249
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:50,630
 spends things out a little bit but local

250
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:50,630
 

251
00:24:48,409 --> 00:24:54,200
 competition finds both diverse and

252
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:54,200
 

253
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:57,500
 high-performing behaviors throughout the

254
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:57,500
 

255
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,940
 space and to give you a sense of what

256
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:58,940
 

257
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,080
 this looks like in practice this is from

258
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,080
 

259
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,820
 one run of evolution where the

260
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,820
 

261
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,860
 population is expanding across all these

262
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:03,860
 

263
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:07,580
 different kinds of solutions you get

264
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:07,580
 

265
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:10,340
 sort of creatures that look maybe sort

266
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:10,340
 

267
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:11,750
 of like you know sushi as you might

268
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:11,750
 

269
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:13,580
 expect things that are kind of

270
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,580
 

271
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:15,200
 quadrupled like or that lumber along in

272
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:15,200
 

273
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:16,850
 the ground that have appropriate amount

274
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,850
 

275
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,650
 of mass but we also see kind of

276
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,650
 

277
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:20,630
 interesting solutions to other niches

278
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,630
 

279
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:23,030
 that it would be very hard to explore

280
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:23,030
 

281
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:24,890
 otherwise where you are at a

282
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,890
 

283
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:26,570
 disadvantage we were very very small for

284
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,570
 

285
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:28,100
 example or you're very big and lumbering

286
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,100
 

287
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:29,990
 and high mass need to balance in a sort

288
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:29,990
 

289
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:32,480
 of a delicate way or you're at all being

290
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,480
 

291
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:34,789
 pull and you're just very delicately

292
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,789
 

293
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,630
 moving but it could be interesting to

294
00:25:34,779 --> 00:25:37,630
 

295
00:25:34,789 --> 00:25:40,309
 see these solutions from this sort of

296
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,309
 

297
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:43,490
 quality diversity perspective so that

298
00:25:40,299 --> 00:25:43,490
 

299
00:25:40,309 --> 00:25:45,080
 ends this part and now Jeff will be kind

300
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,080
 

301
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:47,950
 of elaborating a lot more on these ideas

302
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:47,950
 

303
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,950
 of quality diversity

304
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:48,060
 

305
00:25:48,070 --> 00:26:00,200
 yeah Thank You Joel alright so as Joel's

306
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:00,200
 

307
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,370
 been talking about it I think this is

308
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,370
 

309
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,930
 kind of a theme that we've been noticing

310
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,930
 

311
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:04,550
 in machine learning is that machine

312
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,550
 

313
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:06,830
 learning algorithms tend not to produce

314
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,830
 

315
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:08,809
 a lot of diversity so you launch one run

316
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,809
 

317
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:10,430
 of say deep reinforcement learning and

318
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,430
 

319
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:12,740
 you don't get a lot of diverse solutions

320
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,740
 

321
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:14,030
 you might say well I see things like

322
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:14,030
 

323
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:15,860
 this where I see like four different

324
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,860
 

325
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:17,870
 styles and a lot of blog posts and

326
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:17,870
 

327
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:19,250
 tweets and things like that and the way

328
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,250
 

329
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:20,900
 that this diversity is coming about is

330
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,900
 

331
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:22,280
 that we're doing different entire runs

332
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:22,280
 

333
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:24,170
 of the algorithm with different initial

334
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,170
 

335
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:26,000
 random initializations that were just

336
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,000
 

337
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:27,620
 hoping we get this diversity just not a

338
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:27,620
 

339
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,090
 very principled way if you want to like

340
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:29,090
 

341
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:30,950
 generate a massive amount of diversity

342
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,950
 

343
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:32,510
 just keep doing inefficient runs over

344
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,510
 

345
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:34,220
 and over again now you might think that

346
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,220
 

347
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:35,390
 population based methods in general

348
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:35,390
 

349
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:37,880
 would give you that diversity that

350
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,880
 

351
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:39,679
 should be the razón d'etre but actually

352
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:39,679
 

353
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,000
 it's not true so here's a video that my

354
00:26:39,669 --> 00:26:41,000
 

355
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,670
 colleagues and I produced a few years

356
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:43,670
 

357
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,500
 back we gave an optimization algorithm

358
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,500
 

359
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:46,970
 these four building blocks for a soft

360
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:46,970
 

361
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:49,010
 robotics problem the goal was to have

362
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,010
 

363
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:50,570
 the robot move as fast as possible and

364
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,570
 

365
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:52,660
 we produce this really nice video you

366
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,660
 

367
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:54,830
 see this parade of like very different

368
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,830
 

369
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:56,840
 quirky solutions that are also they're

370
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,840
 

371
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:58,400
 also kind of fun and high-quality in

372
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:58,400
 

373
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,230
 different ways but again we use the same

374
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:00,230
 

375
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,150
 trick that you see from deep RL which is

376
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,150
 

377
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:03,980
 that we have different entire runs each

378
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,980
 

379
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:05,390
 of which produces one of these but

380
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:05,390
 

381
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:06,559
 within this population they're all

382
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,559
 

383
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:08,750
 pretty much converged on one of these

384
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:08,750
 

385
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:10,130
 solutions so what we want instead are

386
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,130
 

387
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:11,690
 what joel was mentioning which are these

388
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,690
 

389
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:13,370
 quality diversity algorithms which you

390
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,370
 

391
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:15,320
 run them and they go out and they find

392
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,320
 

393
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:17,420
 the entire set of diverse

394
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:17,420
 

395
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:19,880
 high-performing ways to go about solving

396
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:19,880
 

397
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:21,980
 this entire class of problems and if we

398
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:21,980
 

399
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,150
 could get that then we might have be

400
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:23,150
 

401
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,050
 able to do a lot of interesting things

402
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,050
 

403
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:25,910
 that I'm going to tell you about

404
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,910
 

405
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:27,740
 so Joel already told you about the first

406
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,740
 

407
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:29,510
 one of those algorithms and SLC

408
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,510
 

409
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:31,670
 and I'm going to tell you about a second

410
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,670
 

411
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:33,110
 major family that was Co invented by my

412
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,110
 

413
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:37,220
 long term friend and colleague John

414
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:37,220
 

415
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:39,830
 Baptiste Marais and myself in 2015 and

416
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:39,830
 

417
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:42,410
 this is called map elites and here's the

418
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,410
 

419
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:43,490
 algorithm it's the acronym is a bit of a

420
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,490
 

421
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:45,740
 mouthful it sends for the

422
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,740
 

423
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:48,170
 multi-dimensional archive of phenotypic

424
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:48,170
 

425
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:49,970
 elites but it's quite simple what you do

426
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,970
 

427
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:51,679
 is you start off by picking them

428
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,679
 

429
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:53,179
 dimensions of variation that you care

430
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:53,179
 

431
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:55,520
 about later I'll show you that you can

432
00:27:53,169 --> 00:27:55,520
 

433
00:27:53,179 --> 00:27:56,840
 learn these automatically as well for

434
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,840
 

435
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,730
 example if you wanted a search in the

436
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:58,730
 

437
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,240
 space of robots you might want robots

438
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,240
 

439
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:02,309
 with different heights and we

440
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:02,309
 

441
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,110
 and then all you do is you discretize

442
00:28:02,299 --> 00:28:04,110
 

443
00:28:02,309 --> 00:28:06,150
 that space and you say we're gonna look

444
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,150
 

445
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:08,040
 for the highest-performing thing and

446
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,040
 

447
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:09,510
 every one of those cells so the way that

448
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,510
 

449
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:12,300
 you can do that is you can start with a

450
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,300
 

451
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:14,100
 random organism you can evaluate it and

452
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,100
 

453
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:16,830
 then you can get both its performance

454
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:16,830
 

455
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:18,540
 which in another language is fitness and

456
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,540
 

457
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:20,100
 you can get its phenotypic properties if

458
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,100
 

459
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:22,350
 I tighten weight and you just put that

460
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:22,350
 

461
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:24,390
 creature or that solution into that area

462
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,390
 

463
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:26,550
 and the bin then you grab something out

464
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,550
 

465
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:29,070
 of this archive here and you randomly

466
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:29,070
 

467
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:31,559
 perturb it and you figure out its new

468
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,559
 

469
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:33,510
 phenotypic problem properties or its

470
00:28:31,549 --> 00:28:33,510
 

471
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:35,010
 characteristics for exists in this case

472
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,010
 

473
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:36,840
 its height and its weight and its

474
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,840
 

475
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:38,280
 performance which is shown here by color

476
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,280
 

477
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,020
 and you put it in that cell in the grid

478
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:40,020
 

479
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:42,090
 and then you can grab another one out of

480
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,090
 

481
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:45,660
 the archive you can perturb it again and

482
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,660
 

483
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:48,000
 maybe if it's better than the current

484
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:48,000
 

485
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:50,160
 champion in a Cell you swap it in and

486
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:50,160
 

487
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,809
 that's it so you just constantly are

488
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:51,809
 

489
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:54,900
 looking for the best thing you found so

490
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:54,900
 

491
00:28:51,809 --> 00:28:57,840
 far and each one of these cells in this

492
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:57,840
 

493
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:59,070
 map so what's nice about this algorithm

494
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,070
 

495
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,110
 is as opposed to doing what most

496
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,110
 

497
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:03,300
 optimization algorithms do which is to

498
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,300
 

499
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:05,610
 return a single highly high-performing

500
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:05,610
 

501
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:07,559
 point this thing should go out and it

502
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,559
 

503
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:09,600
 should show you the entire surface of

504
00:29:07,549 --> 00:29:09,600
 

505
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:11,700
 possibilities within your space that I

506
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,700
 

507
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,559
 can do well here but not here for

508
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:13,559
 

509
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:15,570
 example there's a peak or a mode of

510
00:29:13,549 --> 00:29:15,570
 

511
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:17,580
 performance high performance over here

512
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,580
 

513
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:19,920
 that I can do well with like tall skinny

514
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:19,920
 

515
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:21,179
 robots or tall fat robots but not with

516
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,179
 

517
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:24,210
 something that's kind of an average of

518
00:29:21,169 --> 00:29:24,210
 

519
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:25,890
 the two so we actually ran this problem

520
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,890
 

521
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:27,929
 on that soft robotics problem that I

522
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,929
 

523
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:29,580
 showed you a video of and we tried to

524
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,580
 

525
00:29:27,929 --> 00:29:32,070
 the dimensions we cared about with a

526
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:32,070
 

527
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:33,480
 number of voxels total in the robot so

528
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,480
 

529
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:35,730
 how big it is and also the percent of

530
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:35,730
 

531
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,050
 this dark blue bone material because

532
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,050
 

533
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:38,850
 historically it wasn't using that

534
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,850
 

535
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:40,559
 material and if you look at clacked

536
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,559
 

537
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:42,270
 classic optimization which in this case

538
00:29:40,549 --> 00:29:42,270
 

539
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,490
 is just a black box top to evolutionary

540
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,490
 

541
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:46,890
 algorithm you can see it doesn't cover

542
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,890
 

543
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:48,450
 much of the space of possible types of

544
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,450
 

545
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:50,790
 solutions and most of the performance is

546
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,790
 

547
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:52,380
 very low if you add in diversity in the

548
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,380
 

549
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:53,880
 form of that multi-objective flavor

550
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:53,880
 

551
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:56,280
 which is a kind of a combination of both

552
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:56,280
 

553
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,780
 diversity and performance you can see

554
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,780
 

555
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,309
 that the performance is higher I don't

556
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:59,309
 

557
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:00,720
 if you can see that's yellow there but

558
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:00,720
 

559
00:29:59,309 --> 00:30:02,370
 it still has barely scratched the

560
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,370
 

561
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,790
 surface on what's possible in this space

562
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,790
 

563
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:07,920
 in dramatic contrast map elites does

564
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,920
 

565
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:10,470
 this with the exact same amount of

566
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:10,470
 

567
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:11,880
 computation it fans out and tells you

568
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,880
 

569
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,210
 everything that's possible in this

570
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:12,210
 

571
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,190
 search

572
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,190
 

573
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:16,440
 it illuminates the fact that you have a

574
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,440
 

575
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:18,720
 mode here and a mode here that you can't

576
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:18,720
 

577
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,550
 do very well up here what's also

578
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:20,550
 

579
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,170
 interesting in this kind of algorithm is

580
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,170
 

581
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:24,090
 that if you look through the actual

582
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,090
 

583
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:26,370
 solutions distance in the map is

584
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,370
 

585
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:28,800
 informative because nearby solutions are

586
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,800
 

587
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:31,200
 of similar type and faraway solutions

588
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:31,200
 

589
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:33,060
 are of dissimilar type so for example if

590
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:33,060
 

591
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,340
 you go right here you'll see a solution

592
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:35,340
 

593
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:37,260
 which is kind of this this motif that

594
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:37,260
 

595
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:39,120
 has legs on the front and back and kind

596
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:39,120
 

597
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:41,340
 of a back in the middle and as you sweep

598
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:41,340
 

599
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,800
 up the dimension of the amount of dark

600
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:43,800
 

601
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:46,560
 blue bone material it kind of goes from

602
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:46,560
 

603
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:48,600
 a mostly non boney back to a very very

604
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,600
 

605
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:50,190
 bony shell like a tortoise but these

606
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,190
 

607
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,750
 things all kind of look like relatives

608
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,750
 

609
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:53,340
 of each other and you can go down here

610
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,340
 

611
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,990
 and see variations on a theme or you can

612
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:54,990
 

613
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:57,150
 go up here and see variations on a theme

614
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:57,150
 

615
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:59,040
 so these all things look related to each

616
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:59,040
 

617
00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:00,030
 other because of that distance and

618
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,030
 

619
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,030
 that's going to become important later

620
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:02,030
 

621
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:03,780
 on and we can harness that property

622
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,780
 

623
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:04,860
 another nice property of these

624
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:04,860
 

625
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:06,630
 algorithms they tend to be lower

626
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:06,630
 

627
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:08,250
 variance so different runs of

628
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,250
 

629
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:10,440
 traditional optimization as we saw with

630
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,440
 

631
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:11,850
 deep RL and population-based search

632
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:11,850
 

633
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,500
 produce wildly different solutions

634
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,500
 

635
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:15,060
 whereas different runs of map elites

636
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:15,060
 

637
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:17,280
 kind of tend to repeatedly tell you

638
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:17,280
 

639
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:20,400
 what's possible not exactly the same but

640
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:20,400
 

641
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:22,170
 pretty consistently also of interest is

642
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:22,170
 

643
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,030
 not only this is a different problem

644
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,030
 

645
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:25,590
 here but it doesn't really matter what

646
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,590
 

647
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:27,630
 is also interesting is not only well map

648
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:27,630
 

649
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:29,880
 leads fan out and give you more points

650
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,880
 

651
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:32,190
 and higher quality points across the map

652
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:32,190
 

653
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:34,320
 but if you just look for the single best

654
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:34,320
 

655
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:36,150
 point returned by the algorithm map

656
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,150
 

657
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,220
 police will often give it to you so here

658
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,220
 

659
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:41,000
 it's being compared against NS LC and

660
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:41,000
 

661
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:43,200
 traditional evolutionary algorithms and

662
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:43,200
 

663
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:47,760
 I'm sorry I just realized you can't see

664
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:47,760
 

665
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:49,680
 my pointer okay and the the nice thing

666
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,680
 

667
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,390
 about this is that it's producing an

668
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:51,390
 

669
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,650
 actual better single point which is kind

670
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,650
 

671
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:54,600
 of counterintuitive because traditional

672
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,600
 

673
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:56,790
 optimizations only job is to look for

674
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,790
 

675
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,620
 one high quality point but map elites is

676
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:58,620
 

677
00:31:56,790 --> 00:32:00,570
 producing a better high quality point so

678
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:00,570
 

679
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:02,160
 why is that well I think the answer gets

680
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,160
 

681
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:04,590
 back to this issue of avoiding Local

682
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:04,590
 

683
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:06,720
 Option optima and avoiding deception and

684
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,720
 

685
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:08,280
 one way the quality diversity algorithms

686
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:08,280
 

687
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,870
 do that is via what we call goal

688
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,870
 

689
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:12,480
 switching so imagine if you're a

690
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:12,480
 

691
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:14,760
 scientist and you're trying to say get

692
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:14,760
 

693
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,170
 an AI cub or a robot to walk that's what

694
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,170
 

695
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,910
 you want in your head and you start an

696
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,910
 

697
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:19,590
 optimization process to say move as fast

698
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,590
 

699
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:21,930
 as possible and all of a sudden what you

700
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,930
 

701
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:23,490
 see is a crawling robot well you could

702
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,490
 

703
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:24,960
 say that's a really bad idea that's the

704
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,960
 

705
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:26,119
 dead end I don't want to do that you

706
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,119
 

707
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,259
 know I mean so you change your

708
00:32:26,109 --> 00:32:27,259
 

709
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:28,879
 word function to make sure that its

710
00:32:27,249 --> 00:32:28,879
 

711
00:32:27,259 --> 00:32:30,289
 knees aren't touching the ground or you

712
00:32:28,869 --> 00:32:30,289
 

713
00:32:28,879 --> 00:32:32,389
 can do something totally different and

714
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:32,389
 

715
00:32:30,289 --> 00:32:34,009
 you could say I should catch ants on a

716
00:32:32,379 --> 00:32:34,009
 

717
00:32:32,389 --> 00:32:35,929
 wing here that's a nice serendipitous

718
00:32:33,999 --> 00:32:35,929
 

719
00:32:34,009 --> 00:32:37,789
 discovery I'm going to say hey this is

720
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:37,789
 

721
00:32:35,929 --> 00:32:38,329
 great I have a crawling robot it's doing

722
00:32:37,779 --> 00:32:38,329
 

723
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,399
 pretty well

724
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:40,399
 

725
00:32:38,329 --> 00:32:42,619
 I'm gonna now fork my optimisation

726
00:32:40,389 --> 00:32:42,619
 

727
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:44,059
 process and simultaneously try to get

728
00:32:42,609 --> 00:32:44,059
 

729
00:32:42,619 --> 00:32:45,439
 better and better crawling robots and

730
00:32:44,049 --> 00:32:45,439
 

731
00:32:44,059 --> 00:32:46,939
 maybe continue on with my original

732
00:32:45,429 --> 00:32:46,939
 

733
00:32:45,439 --> 00:32:48,829
 reward function which was some sort of

734
00:32:46,929 --> 00:32:48,829
 

735
00:32:46,939 --> 00:32:50,569
 walking robot and maybe you get a robot

736
00:32:48,819 --> 00:32:50,569
 

737
00:32:48,829 --> 00:32:52,189
 that balances and you say that's great -

738
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,189
 

739
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:54,349
 I'll add that as an additional objective

740
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:54,349
 

741
00:32:52,189 --> 00:32:55,609
 and what's probably going to happen that

742
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:55,609
 

743
00:32:54,349 --> 00:32:57,679
 we see over and over and over again is

744
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:57,679
 

745
00:32:55,609 --> 00:32:59,689
 eventually one of these strange things

746
00:32:57,669 --> 00:32:59,689
 

747
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,979
 like crawling or balancing ends up being

748
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:00,979
 

749
00:32:59,689 --> 00:33:03,049
 a really good stepping stone to

750
00:33:00,969 --> 00:33:03,049
 

751
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:04,489
 ultimately getting a nice walking robot

752
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:04,489
 

753
00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:06,949
 and so you want to keep these

754
00:33:04,479 --> 00:33:06,949
 

755
00:33:04,489 --> 00:33:08,269
 innovations as they come so this is all

756
00:33:06,939 --> 00:33:08,269
 

757
00:33:06,949 --> 00:33:10,729
 laid out really well in the book that

758
00:33:08,259 --> 00:33:10,729
 

759
00:33:08,269 --> 00:33:12,019
 Joel and Ken wrote why greatness cannot

760
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:12,019
 

761
00:33:10,729 --> 00:33:13,729
 be planned and if you look to the

762
00:33:12,009 --> 00:33:13,729
 

763
00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:15,589
 history of science and technological

764
00:33:13,719 --> 00:33:15,589
 

765
00:33:13,729 --> 00:33:18,289
 innovation what you find is you almost

766
00:33:15,579 --> 00:33:18,289
 

767
00:33:15,589 --> 00:33:20,149
 never get an intuitive straight path to

768
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:20,149
 

769
00:33:18,289 --> 00:33:22,219
 an ambitious goal if you want to make

770
00:33:20,139 --> 00:33:22,219
 

771
00:33:20,149 --> 00:33:23,929
 microwaves it turns out that you had to

772
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:23,929
 

773
00:33:22,219 --> 00:33:25,489
 be working on radar systems because

774
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,489
 

775
00:33:23,929 --> 00:33:26,659
 that's where they came from if you want

776
00:33:25,479 --> 00:33:26,659
 

777
00:33:25,489 --> 00:33:28,039
 to build computers you have to be

778
00:33:26,649 --> 00:33:28,039
 

779
00:33:26,659 --> 00:33:30,169
 working on electricity and vacuum

780
00:33:28,029 --> 00:33:30,169
 

781
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:31,669
 clothes and if you vacuum tubes and if

782
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:31,669
 

783
00:33:30,169 --> 00:33:34,069
 you want to produce clean energy you

784
00:33:31,659 --> 00:33:34,069
 

785
00:33:31,669 --> 00:33:36,229
 don't try to make burning of coal and

786
00:33:34,059 --> 00:33:36,229
 

787
00:33:34,069 --> 00:33:38,149
 oil more like less and less polluting

788
00:33:36,219 --> 00:33:38,149
 

789
00:33:36,229 --> 00:33:39,859
 instead you fund a physicist to think

790
00:33:38,139 --> 00:33:39,859
 

791
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:41,389
 about like light beams chasing with the

792
00:33:39,849 --> 00:33:41,389
 

793
00:33:39,859 --> 00:33:43,099
 speed of light on a train you get

794
00:33:41,379 --> 00:33:43,099
 

795
00:33:41,389 --> 00:33:44,869
 Einstein an equals MC squared and then

796
00:33:43,089 --> 00:33:44,869
 

797
00:33:43,099 --> 00:33:46,849
 you get nuclear power so the general

798
00:33:44,859 --> 00:33:46,849
 

799
00:33:44,869 --> 00:33:48,919
 idea is that we want to kind of capture

800
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:48,919
 

801
00:33:46,849 --> 00:33:51,019
 serendipity within our algorithms we

802
00:33:48,909 --> 00:33:51,019
 

803
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:52,699
 want our algorithms to recognize when

804
00:33:51,009 --> 00:33:52,699
 

805
00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:54,829
 something serendipitous and amazing has

806
00:33:52,689 --> 00:33:54,829
 

807
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:56,779
 happened and let that continue to kind

808
00:33:54,819 --> 00:33:56,779
 

809
00:33:54,829 --> 00:33:58,309
 of do its thing and we did get that too

810
00:33:56,769 --> 00:33:58,309
 

811
00:33:56,779 --> 00:34:00,379
 this notion of goal switching so the

812
00:33:58,299 --> 00:34:00,379
 

813
00:33:58,309 --> 00:34:01,759
 idea is that in this map there's each

814
00:34:00,369 --> 00:34:01,759
 

815
00:34:00,379 --> 00:34:03,379
 one of these cells here is kind of a

816
00:34:01,749 --> 00:34:03,379
 

817
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:05,089
 different optimization problem we want

818
00:34:03,369 --> 00:34:05,089
 

819
00:34:03,379 --> 00:34:07,009
 you to solve this problem in this way or

820
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:07,009
 

821
00:34:05,089 --> 00:34:08,720
 that way or this other way and if a

822
00:34:06,999 --> 00:34:08,720
 

823
00:34:07,009 --> 00:34:10,909
 solution in the middle of the map

824
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,909
 

825
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,470
 happens to be like all of a sudden be a

826
00:34:10,899 --> 00:34:12,470
 

827
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:13,879
 really good solution to a totally

828
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,879
 

829
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:15,739
 different problem far away in the map

830
00:34:13,869 --> 00:34:15,739
 

831
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:18,349
 we'd catch that by just put moving that

832
00:34:15,729 --> 00:34:18,349
 

833
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:19,999
 it's the champion to that to that cell

834
00:34:18,339 --> 00:34:19,999
 

835
00:34:18,349 --> 00:34:21,489
 that problem and it could optimization

836
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:21,489
 

837
00:34:19,999 --> 00:34:24,289
 can continue to work on that

838
00:34:21,479 --> 00:34:24,289
 

839
00:34:21,489 --> 00:34:26,450
 simultaneously in parallel so if you

840
00:34:24,279 --> 00:34:26,450
 

841
00:34:24,289 --> 00:34:28,819
 look at the end of a map elites run the

842
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,819
 

843
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:30,289
 final champions we can actually then

844
00:34:28,809 --> 00:34:30,289
 

845
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:32,179
 look at where did they come from where

846
00:34:30,279 --> 00:34:32,179
 

847
00:34:30,289 --> 00:34:33,589
 were their parents if you will and if

848
00:34:32,169 --> 00:34:33,589
 

849
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:35,839
 you look at this map what you'll see is

850
00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:35,839
 

851
00:34:33,589 --> 00:34:37,339
 that often let the arrow tells you that

852
00:34:35,829 --> 00:34:37,339
 

853
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,950
 the tip of the arrow is the final

854
00:34:37,329 --> 00:34:37,950
 

855
00:34:37,339 --> 00:34:39,419
 solution

856
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,419
 

857
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:41,639
 the beginning of the arrow is where it

858
00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:41,639
 

859
00:34:39,419 --> 00:34:43,260
 came from and sometimes it's very nearby

860
00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:43,260
 

861
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:45,270
 and sometimes it comes from within the

862
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,270
 

863
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:46,829
 cell but sometimes you make these really

864
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,829
 

865
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:48,149
 really big leaps so you needed to be

866
00:34:46,819 --> 00:34:48,149
 

867
00:34:46,829 --> 00:34:50,099
 working on this totally different

868
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:50,099
 

869
00:34:48,149 --> 00:34:52,020
 problem in order to kind of lateral over

870
00:34:50,089 --> 00:34:52,020
 

871
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:54,510
 and eventually solve this other problem

872
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:54,510
 

873
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:56,460
 here is a full lineage you take a final

874
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,460
 

875
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:57,839
 champion and you trace it all the way

876
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:57,839
 

877
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,310
 back through time to all of the

878
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,310
 

879
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,750
 different cells that its ancestor

880
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,750
 

881
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:02,970
 visited and what you see are these

882
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,970
 

883
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:05,010
 wildly circuitous paths through the

884
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,010
 

885
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:06,869
 space of Popples the possible solutions

886
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,869
 

887
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:09,060
 you would never probably have picked

888
00:35:06,859 --> 00:35:09,060
 

889
00:35:06,869 --> 00:35:10,890
 this is the curriculum by which to get

890
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:10,890
 

891
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:12,300
 to an actual final point but this

892
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,300
 

893
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:14,070
 algorithm can do that on its own

894
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:14,070
 

895
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:15,810
 automatically so it's really great in

896
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,810
 

897
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:18,510
 these algorithms this are simultaneously

898
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,510
 

899
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:20,730
 pursuing many overlapping curricula

900
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,730
 

901
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:22,650
 there kind of bet hedging you maybe you

902
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,650
 

903
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:24,329
 should go study algebra and then calc 3

904
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,329
 

905
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:25,320
 and then linear algebra and then you'll

906
00:35:24,319 --> 00:35:25,320
 

907
00:35:24,329 --> 00:35:26,400
 become a great machine learning

908
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:26,400
 

909
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,770
 researcher and now you should study

910
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:28,770
 

911
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,990
 philosophy and like humanities and then

912
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,990
 

913
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:32,490
 you should study calc 3 you know etc and

914
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,490
 

915
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:33,660
 you just like trying all these things

916
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,660
 

917
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:35,130
 and then finally you get geoff hinton

918
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:35,130
 

919
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:37,050
 and you declare victory and in hindsight

920
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,050
 

921
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:40,140
 you go back and trace the way to get

922
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,140
 

923
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:41,520
 there so another algorithm in which we

924
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:41,520
 

925
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:43,500
 study these properties is called

926
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,500
 

927
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,119
 innovation engines and this starts from

928
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:45,119
 

929
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:47,520
 the assumption that both natural

930
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:47,520
 

931
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,589
 evolution and cultural evolution and

932
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:49,589
 

933
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,510
 quality diversity algorithms are all

934
00:35:49,579 --> 00:35:51,510
 

935
00:35:49,589 --> 00:35:53,609
 innovation engines because they share

936
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,609
 

937
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:55,530
 this very very simple recipe which is

938
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,530
 

939
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:57,839
 that you start with a set of things and

940
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,839
 

941
00:35:55,530 --> 00:36:00,000
 then you generate per two permutations

942
00:35:57,829 --> 00:36:00,000
 

943
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:01,950
 on those things and if those things are

944
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:01,950
 

945
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,450
 interesting and/or high-performing you

946
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,450
 

947
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:05,430
 keep them and you add them to your set

948
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,430
 

949
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:07,380
 and you expand in this ever-growing set

950
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,380
 

951
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:09,000
 of stepping stones that can lead you

952
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:09,000
 

953
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:10,859
 ultimately to really interesting things

954
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:10,859
 

955
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,119
 so we wanted to try to create one of

956
00:36:10,849 --> 00:36:12,119
 

957
00:36:10,859 --> 00:36:14,190
 these innovation engines and the way

958
00:36:12,109 --> 00:36:14,190
 

959
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:16,650
 that we did it is that we decided well

960
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,650
 

961
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:18,240
 so far all of the Kiwi dqd algorithms

962
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,240
 

963
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:20,010
 that had come before this work all had a

964
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:20,010
 

965
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,420
 very simple notion of what constituted

966
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,420
 

967
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:24,200
 being interesting or high-performing

968
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:24,200
 

969
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:26,670
 maybe a robot that moves fast or

970
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:26,670
 

971
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:28,530
 something very easy to measure in this

972
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,530
 

973
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:30,240
 case we wanted to say can we have a

974
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,240
 

975
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:32,040
 measure of interestingness that is more

976
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,040
 

977
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,270
 kind of abstract and hard to quantify so

978
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,270
 

979
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,069
 we wanted to use deep neural networks

980
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,069
 

981
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:36,960
 and we said we're gonna try to generate

982
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:36,960
 

983
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:39,240
 images this was like before Ganz the

984
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:39,240
 

985
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,980
 Gann craze had really taken off and so

986
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,980
 

987
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,480
 we said we're gonna use a trained deep

988
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:42,480
 

989
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:44,819
 neuron that Alex that we're gonna try to

990
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:44,819
 

991
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,550
 generate an image that lights up each of

992
00:36:44,809 --> 00:36:47,550
 

993
00:36:44,819 --> 00:36:49,950
 the classes in Alex net and so each bin

994
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,950
 

995
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:50,730
 in mapa leads is one class in alex 10

996
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:50,730
 

997
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:53,010
 and if you're the bed

998
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,010
 

999
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:55,200
 image ever for that class you're the

1000
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,200
 

1001
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:56,400
 highest confidence scoring thing for

1002
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,400
 

1003
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,720
 that class according to Alex net we'd

1004
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:57,720
 

1005
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,280
 keep you and then we'll just preserve

1006
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:59,280
 

1007
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,660
 these things we also wanted to try this

1008
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:00,660
 

1009
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,070
 with these very tiny little networks

1010
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:02,070
 

1011
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,630
 that are an interesting encoding called

1012
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,630
 

1013
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:05,670
 CPP ends which Ken is going to tell you

1014
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,670
 

1015
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:07,440
 about a little bit later and there's

1016
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,440
 

1017
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:09,060
 lots of deception and local optima so

1018
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:09,060
 

1019
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,829
 what we found in this innovation engine

1020
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:10,829
 

1021
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,570
 work is that if you just have one class

1022
00:37:10,819 --> 00:37:12,570
 

1023
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:14,190
 like if I picked the watertower class

1024
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,190
 

1025
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:15,420
 and I try to optimize one of these

1026
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,420
 

1027
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:17,400
 little generator networks to just

1028
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:17,400
 

1029
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:19,050
 produce a really good water tower what I

1030
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:19,050
 

1031
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,490
 do is I freak when they get stuck on a

1032
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,490
 

1033
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:23,400
 local Optima which is what you see here

1034
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,400
 

1035
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:24,900
 in the top row and it gets stuck on one

1036
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:24,900
 

1037
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,849
 design and it can't ever get off that

1038
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:26,849
 

1039
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,770
 set a local optimum but if you have

1040
00:37:26,839 --> 00:37:28,770
 

1041
00:37:26,849 --> 00:37:30,150
 thousands a thousand objectives which

1042
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,150
 

1043
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:32,310
 are all the classes of image now and you

1044
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,310
 

1045
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:34,290
 let things goal switch between these

1046
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,290
 

1047
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:36,329
 classes then really interesting things

1048
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,329
 

1049
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:38,099
 can happen for example early in this run

1050
00:37:36,319 --> 00:37:38,099
 

1051
00:37:36,329 --> 00:37:40,290
 it lands on this kind of dome that looks

1052
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,290
 

1053
00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:42,300
 like the moon and it gets to about 51

1054
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,300
 

1055
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:44,099
 percent accuracy according to Alex net

1056
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:44,099
 

1057
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,750
 for being a water tower and that is

1058
00:37:44,089 --> 00:37:45,750
 

1059
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:47,820
 stuck we actually did a counterfactual

1060
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,820
 

1061
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:49,260
 where you just run that individual niche

1062
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:49,260
 

1063
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:51,810
 forever with that solution and it never

1064
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:51,810
 

1065
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:53,460
 leaves that concept but for some other

1066
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,460
 

1067
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:56,220
 innovation came from a different class

1068
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:56,220
 

1069
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:58,349
 which just kind of came in and took over

1070
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:58,349
 

1071
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:00,030
 in that niche with and that basically

1072
00:37:58,339 --> 00:38:00,030
 

1073
00:37:58,349 --> 00:38:02,609
 led to a completely different style of

1074
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:02,609
 

1075
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:03,750
 solution we ultimately got to 98% and in

1076
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:03,750
 

1077
00:38:02,609 --> 00:38:05,819
 my opinion looks like a much better

1078
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,819
 

1079
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:07,260
 water tower now you can quantify these

1080
00:38:05,809 --> 00:38:07,260
 

1081
00:38:05,819 --> 00:38:09,300
 effects so if you look if you compare

1082
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:09,300
 

1083
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:11,099
 map elites with just with a thousand

1084
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:11,099
 

1085
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:12,329
 classes versus a whole lot of different

1086
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:12,329
 

1087
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:13,619
 runs with map elites with all the

1088
00:38:12,319 --> 00:38:13,619
 

1089
00:38:12,329 --> 00:38:15,329
 different classes of imagenet where you

1090
00:38:13,609 --> 00:38:15,329
 

1091
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:17,220
 average performance you see this massive

1092
00:38:15,319 --> 00:38:17,220
 

1093
00:38:15,329 --> 00:38:19,109
 difference in the final performance of

1094
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:19,109
 

1095
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:20,819
 these algorithms and as you change the

1096
00:38:19,099 --> 00:38:20,819
 

1097
00:38:19,109 --> 00:38:22,050
 number of objectives the more objectives

1098
00:38:20,809 --> 00:38:22,050
 

1099
00:38:20,819 --> 00:38:23,819
 the better because the more goal

1100
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,819
 

1101
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:26,550
 switching you have which you can see on

1102
00:38:23,809 --> 00:38:26,550
 

1103
00:38:23,819 --> 00:38:28,950
 these slides here now another really

1104
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,950
 

1105
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:30,540
 nice thing about these algorithms is

1106
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,540
 

1107
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:33,000
 they have what are known as adaptive

1108
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:33,000
 

1109
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:34,230
 radiations so these are really really

1110
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:34,230
 

1111
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,609
 important things to have in our

1112
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,609
 

1113
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:37,619
 algorithm once you come up with a

1114
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,619
 

1115
00:38:35,609 --> 00:38:40,319
 fundamental advance whether or not it be

1116
00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:40,319
 

1117
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:42,359
 bilateral symmetry or the notion of like

1118
00:38:40,309 --> 00:38:42,359
 

1119
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:44,700
 a four-legged body plans or arms and

1120
00:38:42,349 --> 00:38:44,700
 

1121
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:47,280
 legs or fingers that central innovation

1122
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:47,280
 

1123
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:49,200
 can fan out and radiate out into all

1124
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:49,200
 

1125
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,810
 sorts of different niches or problem

1126
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:51,810
 

1127
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,040
 spaces this happens both in natural

1128
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,040
 

1129
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:54,900
 biology but it also happens in

1130
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,900
 

1131
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,609
 technology once we invented the computer

1132
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:56,609
 

1133
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:58,349
 it was realized oh that's a really good

1134
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:58,349
 

1135
00:38:56,609 --> 00:38:59,760
 solution to lots of different scientific

1136
00:38:58,339 --> 00:38:59,760
 

1137
00:38:58,349 --> 00:39:01,920
 and technological challenges and that

1138
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:01,920
 

1139
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,170
 innovation fanned out but once it fans

1140
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,170
 

1141
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,329
 out it doesn't stay in the

1142
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,329
 

1143
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:07,010
 same shape it begins it gets customized

1144
00:39:05,319 --> 00:39:07,010
 

1145
00:39:05,329 --> 00:39:08,480
 and specialized to all of the different

1146
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,480
 

1147
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:10,579
 situations that we want to use that

1148
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:10,579
 

1149
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,260
 technology and so you have an innovation

1150
00:39:10,569 --> 00:39:12,260
 

1151
00:39:10,579 --> 00:39:13,460
 and then it percolates and things get

1152
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,460
 

1153
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:15,109
 built on top of it and then there's an

1154
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:15,109
 

1155
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:16,700
 innovation over here and that fans out

1156
00:39:15,099 --> 00:39:16,700
 

1157
00:39:15,109 --> 00:39:18,859
 and you get these radiations through

1158
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:18,859
 

1159
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:20,720
 technological space and you can see this

1160
00:39:18,849 --> 00:39:20,720
 

1161
00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:22,460
 in quality diversity algorithm so this

1162
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:22,460
 

1163
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,319
 is one of my favorite plots of my entire

1164
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:24,319
 

1165
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:26,270
 scientific career here we have the

1166
00:39:24,309 --> 00:39:26,270
 

1167
00:39:24,319 --> 00:39:28,099
 innovation engine and early on in the

1168
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,099
 

1169
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:30,140
 run there was one little network that

1170
00:39:28,089 --> 00:39:30,140
 

1171
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:32,420
 produced this dome this red and black

1172
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:32,420
 

1173
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:34,670
 dome at the very top here for abaya and

1174
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:34,670
 

1175
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:36,740
 that central innovation fanned out and

1176
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,740
 

1177
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:39,380
 radiated into all these other imagenet

1178
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:39,380
 

1179
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:41,480
 classes such as volcano mosque water

1180
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:41,480
 

1181
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:44,450
 tower beacon yurt

1182
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:44,450
 

1183
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:46,010
 Church planetarium obelisk and dome so

1184
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,010
 

1185
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:47,660
 we want algorithms that come up with a

1186
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,660
 

1187
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:49,190
 good idea and then harness that good

1188
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:49,190
 

1189
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:50,780
 idea in many different ways and build

1190
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,780
 

1191
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:53,420
 upon it and build upon it and build upon

1192
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:53,420
 

1193
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:54,950
 it now this idea might sound familiar

1194
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:54,950
 

1195
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:56,930
 this idea of goal switching might sound

1196
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,930
 

1197
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:58,430
 familiar to you recently there was a

1198
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,430
 

1199
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:59,930
 traditional work in this community

1200
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,930
 

1201
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:01,520
 traditional machine learning called

1202
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,520
 

1203
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:03,380
 hindsight experience replay and it's

1204
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:03,380
 

1205
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,329
 actually remarkably similar the idea is

1206
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:05,329
 

1207
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:06,559
 you have a single RL agent that's goal

1208
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:06,559
 

1209
00:40:05,329 --> 00:40:08,630
 condition is trying to get to a

1210
00:40:06,549 --> 00:40:08,630
 

1211
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:09,770
 particular goal and if you say hey go to

1212
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,770
 

1213
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:11,390
 the back of that room there and it

1214
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,390
 

1215
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:13,040
 happens to go over there as opposed to

1216
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,040
 

1217
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:15,049
 saying bad robot I'm giving it zero

1218
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:15,049
 

1219
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:17,299
 reward you say fantastic now I know how

1220
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:17,299
 

1221
00:40:15,049 --> 00:40:19,040
 to get over there and you add in a goal

1222
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:19,040
 

1223
00:40:17,299 --> 00:40:20,329
 that says I want to be able to get there

1224
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:20,329
 

1225
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,589
 and I already know how to do it and you

1226
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:21,589
 

1227
00:40:20,329 --> 00:40:23,270
 keep doing that until you kind of learn

1228
00:40:21,579 --> 00:40:23,270
 

1229
00:40:21,589 --> 00:40:24,619
 to go everywhere so effectively that is

1230
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,619
 

1231
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:26,599
 a cutey algorithm it's learning

1232
00:40:24,609 --> 00:40:26,599
 

1233
00:40:24,619 --> 00:40:29,210
 ultimately the highest quality way to

1234
00:40:26,589 --> 00:40:29,210
 

1235
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:30,619
 get to a diverse set of goals but in

1236
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,619
 

1237
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:32,660
 this case it's not a population of

1238
00:40:30,609 --> 00:40:32,660
 

1239
00:40:30,619 --> 00:40:35,059
 agents it's a population of goals kind

1240
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:35,059
 

1241
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:37,160
 of within the head of one policy or one

1242
00:40:35,049 --> 00:40:37,160
 

1243
00:40:35,059 --> 00:40:38,780
 agent so it's a nice example of similar

1244
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,780
 

1245
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:40,940
 ideas working out great and deep

1246
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,940
 

1247
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:42,440
 reinforcement learning another insight

1248
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:42,440
 

1249
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:43,819
 behind QD algorithms which i think is

1250
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:43,819
 

1251
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:46,040
 really interesting is that we frequently

1252
00:40:43,809 --> 00:40:46,040
 

1253
00:40:43,819 --> 00:40:47,420
 don't want just a bunch of specialists

1254
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:47,420
 

1255
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,680
 maybe that's what you're thinking in the

1256
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:48,680
 

1257
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:50,450
 audience it's like this is a great way

1258
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:50,450
 

1259
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:52,099
 to get an entire repertoire of

1260
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,099
 

1261
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:53,900
 specialists but often we want

1262
00:40:52,089 --> 00:40:53,900
 

1263
00:40:52,099 --> 00:40:55,839
 generalists but you can use these ideas

1264
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:55,839
 

1265
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:57,920
 and algorithms also to generate

1266
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:57,920
 

1267
00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:00,650
 generalists so we came up with this idea

1268
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:00,650
 

1269
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,390
 called Samoa with Yost huizinga and

1270
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,390
 

1271
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:03,710
 myself and we're the ideas that we want

1272
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,710
 

1273
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:04,609
 robots that can perform many different

1274
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,609
 

1275
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:07,190
 actions or skills in different

1276
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:07,190
 

1277
00:41:04,609 --> 00:41:08,930
 situations and the insight is that if

1278
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,930
 

1279
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:11,420
 you want a robot say to perform these

1280
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,420
 

1281
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:12,859
 six tasks here then what you can do is

1282
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:12,859
 

1283
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:14,530
 you can get a curriculum that's kind of

1284
00:41:12,849 --> 00:41:14,530
 

1285
00:41:12,859 --> 00:41:15,730
 slowly first you learn this task

1286
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,730
 

1287
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:16,690
 you learn this task then you learn this

1288
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,690
 

1289
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:18,430
 task but you don't know which is the

1290
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,430
 

1291
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:20,260
 right curriculum but if you use the

1292
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,260
 

1293
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:22,930
 principles of QD then you can have one

1294
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:22,930
 

1295
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:25,120
 niche per single atom task and then one

1296
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,120
 

1297
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:26,560
 niche per combination of tasks and you

1298
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,560
 

1299
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:28,450
 can end up with this kind of exponential

1300
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,450
 

1301
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,070
 set of tasks that you're willing to

1302
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,070
 

1303
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:31,900
 simultaneously optimize for and

1304
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,900
 

1305
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:33,220
 solutions can start by getting good at

1306
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:33,220
 

1307
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,930
 one and then they happen to be good at a

1308
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:34,930
 

1309
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:37,120
 2 and then 3 and then maybe they go back

1310
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,120
 

1311
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:39,550
 to a 2 and you can trace all sorts of

1312
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:39,550
 

1313
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:41,170
 wild and crazy' curricula through this

1314
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,170
 

1315
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:43,000
 set of possibilities and ultimately you

1316
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,000
 

1317
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:46,300
 might get to a solution to all of the

1318
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:46,300
 

1319
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,190
 tasks and quantify this this strategy

1320
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:48,190
 

1321
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:50,590
 works quite well so here is a quick

1322
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:50,590
 

1323
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:52,600
 video for example of a robot that learns

1324
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,600
 

1325
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:54,820
 how to you know turn laughs turn right

1326
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:54,820
 

1327
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:58,030
 even do a karate kick at the end and the

1328
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:58,030
 

1329
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:59,410
 other tasks as well so I want to quickly

1330
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,410
 

1331
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:00,880
 try to tell you about some of the other

1332
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,880
 

1333
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:02,530
 applications because one of the things

1334
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:02,530
 

1335
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,360
 that we found with Qt algorithms is that

1336
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,360
 

1337
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:05,860
 there's so many good kind of basic ideas

1338
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:05,860
 

1339
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,930
 and healthy optimization going on that

1340
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:07,930
 

1341
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:09,730
 once you have this set of high quality

1342
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,730
 

1343
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:11,890
 diverse solutions to a problem there's

1344
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,890
 

1345
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:13,720
 really a lot of things that you can do

1346
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,720
 

1347
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:14,950
 with that that you might not normally be

1348
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:14,950
 

1349
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,690
 able to do with traditional machine

1350
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,690
 

1351
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:19,300
 learning algorithms so we had this paper

1352
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,300
 

1353
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:22,060
 those on the cover of nature in 2015 on

1354
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:22,060
 

1355
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:23,260
 robots that can adapt to damage and

1356
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:23,260
 

1357
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:25,630
 ultimately produce state-of-the-art

1358
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:25,630
 

1359
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:28,210
 damage recovery so if we want robots

1360
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:28,210
 

1361
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:29,920
 that can get out into the world and help

1362
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,920
 

1363
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:32,740
 us you know put out forest fires find

1364
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:32,740
 

1365
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,540
 survivors just get out of the laboratory

1366
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:34,540
 

1367
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:35,800
 and into our homes we're gonna need to

1368
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:35,800
 

1369
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:37,960
 deal with the fact that robots

1370
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:37,960
 

1371
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,850
 inevitably will become damaged

1372
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:39,850
 

1373
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,950
 now modern learning based approaches as

1374
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,950
 

1375
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:44,020
 we all know are extremely sampled

1376
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:44,020
 

1377
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:46,600
 inefficient we cannot just run them live

1378
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:46,600
 

1379
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:48,370
 in the world if we ever can do that it's

1380
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:48,370
 

1381
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:51,430
 usually on very simple robots with low

1382
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,430
 

1383
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:53,290
 dimensional state spaces so what we look

1384
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,290
 

1385
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:55,180
 to is animals for inspiration and

1386
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,180
 

1387
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:57,130
 animals in contrast have very very

1388
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:57,130
 

1389
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:58,690
 different intuitions they start out with

1390
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,690
 

1391
00:42:57,130 --> 00:43:01,240
 intuitions for totally different ways to

1392
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,240
 

1393
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:02,530
 move and then they if they become

1394
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:02,530
 

1395
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:04,480
 damaged they conduct a few intelligent

1396
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,480
 

1397
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:07,900
 tests and then they pick a behavior that

1398
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:07,900
 

1399
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:09,610
 works despite injury so we want to kind

1400
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:09,610
 

1401
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:11,380
 of algorithmically produce that pipeline

1402
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,380
 

1403
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:13,960
 and the way that we do it is that we

1404
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:13,960
 

1405
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:16,210
 harness the ideas of QD so here is the

1406
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:16,210
 

1407
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:19,810
 robot that we were using in this

1408
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:19,810
 

1409
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:20,980
 experiment there we go and what we're

1410
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,980
 

1411
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:23,500
 gonna do is we're going to launch a

1412
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:23,500
 

1413
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:26,320
 Mapple each prog algorithm ahead of time

1414
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:26,320
 

1415
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:28,030
 in simulation and its goal is to find a

1416
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:28,030
 

1417
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,890
 whole lot of different ways

1418
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:29,890
 

1419
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:31,330
 walk and so the way that we did that is

1420
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,330
 

1421
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:32,140
 we have a behavioral characterization

1422
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,140
 

1423
00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:34,210
 remember we have to define the

1424
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:34,210
 

1425
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:36,280
 dimensions of this grid so this is a 6

1426
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,280
 

1427
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:38,500
 dimensional hypercube each dimension is

1428
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:38,500
 

1429
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:40,210
 the percent of time that a given leg is

1430
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,210
 

1431
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,920
 touching the ground so you have to learn

1432
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,920
 

1433
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:43,180
 without like you know learn without ever

1434
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:43,180
 

1435
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,290
 using this leg and then learn how to

1436
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:44,290
 

1437
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:45,970
 walk without ever the use through this

1438
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,970
 

1439
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:47,410
 leg we learn how to walk with using this

1440
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,410
 

1441
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:48,460
 leg ten percent of the time twenty

1442
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,460
 

1443
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:50,770
 percent of the time all possible

1444
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:50,770
 

1445
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:52,300
 combinations the original search space

1446
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,300
 

1447
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:54,580
 here has more molecules than there are

1448
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:54,580
 

1449
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:56,980
 in the solar system the final map

1450
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:56,980
 

1451
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:59,170
 produced by map elites are 13,000

1452
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:59,170
 

1453
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:01,480
 high-performing gates here's an example

1454
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,480
 

1455
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:04,530
 of one of the gates and what you can see

1456
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:04,530
 

1457
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:08,290
 is that it walks oh that's not working

1458
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:08,290
 

1459
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:10,090
 you gonna work for me no all right well

1460
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,090
 

1461
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:11,290
 this gate uses that leg ten percent of

1462
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,290
 

1463
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:13,440
 the time and then another leg another

1464
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,440
 

1465
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:20,880
 ten percent of the time there was also

1466
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:20,880
 

1467
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:20,880
 these all my videos did that's a shame

1468
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:21,560
 

1469
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:26,160
 mmm work here

1470
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:26,750
 

1471
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:31,770
 yes all right well there with the humor

1472
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:31,770
 

1473
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:35,130
 but the idea here is that there was a

1474
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,130
 

1475
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:38,760
 gate we challenged optimization to try

1476
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:38,760
 

1477
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:40,380
 to produce but oh that's not even

1478
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:40,380
 

1479
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:44,280
 working ok never mind I'll just skip

1480
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:44,280
 

1481
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:45,510
 that ok hmm I don't know if the AV

1482
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:45,510
 

1483
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,970
 people could get to help us get the

1484
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,970
 

1485
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:51,960
 videos working I don't know what's going

1486
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:51,960
 

1487
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:53,340
 on there so one thing I want to point

1488
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:53,340
 

1489
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,869
 out is that this map relates algorithms

1490
00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:54,869
 

1491
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:59,250
 have figured out 13,000 different ways

1492
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:59,250
 

1493
00:44:54,869 --> 00:45:00,690
 to walk and now at game time the robot

1494
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,690
 

1495
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:02,609
 has become damaged and we need to figure

1496
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,609
 

1497
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:04,380
 out what to do you could say that I

1498
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:04,380
 

1499
00:45:02,609 --> 00:45:06,240
 should try the top-end gates in this

1500
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:06,240
 

1501
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:07,710
 repertoire but remember nearby gates in

1502
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:07,710
 

1503
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,660
 this map are similar so that would be a

1504
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,660
 

1505
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:11,280
 pretty bad idea instead what we want to

1506
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:11,280
 

1507
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:13,020
 do is kind of try one gate if that

1508
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:13,020
 

1509
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,090
 family of gates doesn't work rule that

1510
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:15,090
 

1511
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:16,770
 out try a different gate if that family

1512
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,770
 

1513
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:19,680
 of gates doesn't work rule that out and

1514
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,680
 

1515
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:21,960
 keep going and so we can do that by

1516
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:21,960
 

1517
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,970
 heart combat combining map elites with

1518
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:23,970
 

1519
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:27,180
 Bayesian optimization so the general

1520
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:27,180
 

1521
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:28,770
 flow here is that the prior of how each

1522
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:28,770
 

1523
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:31,890
 gate how well each gate work comes from

1524
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:31,890
 

1525
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:35,100
 map elites the posterior gets updated as

1526
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:35,100
 

1527
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:36,780
 we do experiments in in the real world

1528
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:36,780
 

1529
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:38,340
 with Bayesian optimization and based

1530
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:38,340
 

1531
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:39,869
 optimization will update the posterior

1532
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:39,869
 

1533
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:41,640
 estimate of how well each of these gates

1534
00:45:39,859 --> 00:45:41,640
 

1535
00:45:39,869 --> 00:45:44,640
 work and then we can just stop once we

1536
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:44,640
 

1537
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:46,560
 have a high-performing enough robot so

1538
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:46,560
 

1539
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,150
 here's kind of a one-dimensional example

1540
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:48,150
 

1541
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,800
 of how this work we run map elites ahead

1542
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:49,800
 

1543
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:51,119
 of time to kind of figure out how well

1544
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:51,119
 

1545
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:53,400
 we can do at each point along this

1546
00:45:51,109 --> 00:45:53,400
 

1547
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:54,960
 behavioral characterization then we try

1548
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:54,960
 

1549
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:57,000
 our highest performing thing if it

1550
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:57,000
 

1551
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,859
 doesn't work we update our prediction

1552
00:45:56,990 --> 00:45:58,859
 

1553
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,630
 for how well that robot does and then

1554
00:45:58,849 --> 00:46:00,630
 

1555
00:45:58,859 --> 00:46:03,000
 here's where the magic happens you can

1556
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:03,000
 

1557
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:05,070
 also update your the prediction for

1558
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:05,070
 

1559
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,020
 nearby points as a function of distance

1560
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:07,020
 

1561
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:08,940
 both the mean and the uncertainty

1562
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:08,940
 

1563
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:11,070
 because that experiment taught us a lot

1564
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:11,070
 

1565
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:12,810
 about the robot near you know all the

1566
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,810
 

1567
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:14,070
 robots in the area near where we test it

1568
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,070
 

1569
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:16,050
 and didn't teach us almost anything

1570
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:16,050
 

1571
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:18,390
 about robots that are far away and that

1572
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,390
 

1573
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:19,410
 allows us to run this and then we can

1574
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:19,410
 

1575
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:21,570
 just stop when we have something that's

1576
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,570
 

1577
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:24,330
 good enough now well the robot will the

1578
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,330
 

1579
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:26,550
 videos work oh here we go good alright

1580
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,550
 

1581
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:28,859
 so here is a the original robot it's

1582
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:28,859
 

1583
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:30,750
 moving at 0.25 meters per second then it

1584
00:46:28,849 --> 00:46:30,750
 

1585
00:46:28,859 --> 00:46:33,510
 becomes damaged and that original gate

1586
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:33,510
 

1587
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:36,450
 no longer works it's down to 0.03 meters

1588
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:36,450
 

1589
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:38,280
 per second and so we have to adapt so we

1590
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:38,280
 

1591
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:39,910
 launched this process and you can see

1592
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:39,910
 

1593
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:41,740
 the prior in

1594
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,740
 

1595
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:43,750
 in the map here the colors are the

1596
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:43,750
 

1597
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:45,789
 original coming out of map elites from

1598
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:45,789
 

1599
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:47,650
 simulation on an undamaged robot

1600
00:46:45,779 --> 00:46:47,650
 

1601
00:46:45,789 --> 00:46:49,180
 predictions and then we'll test one of

1602
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,180
 

1603
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:50,559
 them and you'll see we'll update our

1604
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:50,559
 

1605
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:52,599
 posterior prediction of these

1606
00:46:50,549 --> 00:46:52,599
 

1607
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:53,829
 performances based on what happens in

1608
00:46:52,589 --> 00:46:53,829
 

1609
00:46:52,599 --> 00:46:56,079
 the real world we find out for example

1610
00:46:53,819 --> 00:46:56,079
 

1611
00:46:53,829 --> 00:46:57,730
 this gate here doesn't work very well

1612
00:46:56,069 --> 00:46:57,730
 

1613
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:59,740
 and so you'll see kind of the blue color

1614
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,740
 

1615
00:46:57,730 --> 00:47:00,910
 percolate through the map there now

1616
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:00,910
 

1617
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:03,099
 we're honor I think our second

1618
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,099
 

1619
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:06,339
 experiment our third here we're at 0.1 7

1620
00:47:03,089 --> 00:47:06,339
 

1621
00:47:03,099 --> 00:47:08,859
 meters per sec 1 3 meters per second

1622
00:47:06,329 --> 00:47:08,859
 

1623
00:47:06,339 --> 00:47:12,069
 we then shot another one which is point

1624
00:47:08,849 --> 00:47:12,069
 

1625
00:47:08,859 --> 00:47:15,789
 2 sorry point 2 meters per second and is

1626
00:47:12,059 --> 00:47:15,789
 

1627
00:47:12,069 --> 00:47:18,460
 almost straight and then now in 26

1628
00:47:15,779 --> 00:47:18,460
 

1629
00:47:15,789 --> 00:47:19,630
 seconds of real wach wach chime we now

1630
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:19,630
 

1631
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:21,279
 have the gate that has recovered the

1632
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:21,279
 

1633
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:23,529
 original performance of the robot more

1634
00:47:21,269 --> 00:47:23,529
 

1635
00:47:21,279 --> 00:47:25,509
 or less 0.2 4 meters per second and walk

1636
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:25,509
 

1637
00:47:23,529 --> 00:47:28,000
 straight which is quite remarkable so in

1638
00:47:25,499 --> 00:47:28,000
 

1639
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:28,809
 about 5 experiments in 20 30 seconds we

1640
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:28,809
 

1641
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,069
 have a solution

1642
00:47:28,799 --> 00:47:30,069
 

1643
00:47:28,809 --> 00:47:31,799
 we tried this in a variety of different

1644
00:47:30,059 --> 00:47:31,799
 

1645
00:47:30,069 --> 00:47:35,019
 damage conditions it works quite well

1646
00:47:31,789 --> 00:47:35,019
 

1647
00:47:31,799 --> 00:47:36,730
 and one of the things that we did is we

1648
00:47:35,009 --> 00:47:36,730
 

1649
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:38,500
 compared this to the stuff that is being

1650
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,500
 

1651
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:40,029
 presented here at ICML more

1652
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:40,029
 

1653
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:42,339
 traditionally so if you run Bayesian

1654
00:47:40,019 --> 00:47:42,339
 

1655
00:47:40,029 --> 00:47:44,079
 optimization or policy gradients in the

1656
00:47:42,329 --> 00:47:44,079
 

1657
00:47:42,339 --> 00:47:45,640
 original search space well you get are

1658
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:45,640
 

1659
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:47,380
 these two curves on the bottom here that

1660
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:47,380
 

1661
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:48,940
 don't work really well everything else

1662
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:48,940
 

1663
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:50,619
 that piggybacked on the back of map

1664
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:50,619
 

1665
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:52,930
 elites or all the algorithms at the top

1666
00:47:50,609 --> 00:47:52,930
 

1667
00:47:50,619 --> 00:47:54,160
 which really work quite well so that was

1668
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,160
 

1669
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:56,079
 kind of the principal component of

1670
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:56,079
 

1671
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:57,910
 success here we tried it on a different

1672
00:47:56,069 --> 00:47:57,910
 

1673
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:59,410
 robot we try to it also works to adapt

1674
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,410
 

1675
00:47:57,910 --> 00:48:00,789
 to different environments etc so it's a

1676
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,789
 

1677
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:03,519
 way to get very sample efficient

1678
00:48:00,779 --> 00:48:03,519
 

1679
00:48:00,789 --> 00:48:05,049
 learning so I also want to point out

1680
00:48:03,509 --> 00:48:05,049
 

1681
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:06,369
 that that work didn't actually have deep

1682
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:06,369
 

1683
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:07,869
 RL in it but there's no reason you

1684
00:48:06,359 --> 00:48:07,869
 

1685
00:48:06,369 --> 00:48:09,880
 couldn't use deep RL there's another

1686
00:48:07,859 --> 00:48:09,880
 

1687
00:48:07,869 --> 00:48:12,099
 team that just took our exact algorithm

1688
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:12,099
 

1689
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:13,420
 and drop deep RL n where you use deep RL

1690
00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:13,420
 

1691
00:48:12,099 --> 00:48:15,430
 to learn a variety of different gates

1692
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:15,430
 

1693
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:17,049
 and it works exactly the same and as

1694
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:17,049
 

1695
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:19,329
 well so the conclusion of that mini

1696
00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:19,329
 

1697
00:48:17,049 --> 00:48:20,529
 paper on the robotic damage recovery is

1698
00:48:19,319 --> 00:48:20,529
 

1699
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:22,240
 that you can get state-of-the-art damage

1700
00:48:20,519 --> 00:48:22,240
 

1701
00:48:20,529 --> 00:48:24,819
 recovery by combining the kind of the

1702
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:24,819
 

1703
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,869
 creativity of QT algorithms to go out

1704
00:48:24,809 --> 00:48:25,869
 

1705
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:27,849
 and get you a set of really high

1706
00:48:25,859 --> 00:48:27,849
 

1707
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:29,470
 performing diverse things and then you

1708
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:29,470
 

1709
00:48:27,849 --> 00:48:31,000
 can use Bayesian optimization to sift

1710
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:31,000
 

1711
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:32,470
 through them depend and find the one

1712
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:32,470
 

1713
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,650
 that you need that works for the

1714
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:35,650
 

1715
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:38,230
 situation which shows a benefit of QD of

1716
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:38,230
 

1717
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:40,269
 QT and using it in kind of a new context

1718
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:40,269
 

1719
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:41,589
 now another interesting point about all

1720
00:48:40,259 --> 00:48:41,589
 

1721
00:48:40,269 --> 00:48:43,269
 of this QT work which you might find

1722
00:48:41,579 --> 00:48:43,269
 

1723
00:48:41,589 --> 00:48:44,619
 objectionable is that we've been hand

1724
00:48:43,259 --> 00:48:44,619
 

1725
00:48:43,269 --> 00:48:45,789
 deciding what these behavioral

1726
00:48:44,609 --> 00:48:45,789
 

1727
00:48:44,619 --> 00:48:47,980
 characterizations are what the

1728
00:48:45,779 --> 00:48:47,980
 

1729
00:48:45,789 --> 00:48:49,509
 dimensions of these maps are but you can

1730
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:49,509
 

1731
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:51,579
 also learn them so there's a brand new

1732
00:48:49,499 --> 00:48:51,579
 

1733
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:52,670
 paper that did an idea that we wanted to

1734
00:48:51,569 --> 00:48:52,670
 

1735
00:48:51,579 --> 00:48:54,109
 do from the original

1736
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:54,109
 

1737
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:55,849
 deception of map elites which is that

1738
00:48:54,099 --> 00:48:55,849
 

1739
00:48:54,109 --> 00:48:57,319
 you can generate some random policies

1740
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:57,319
 

1741
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:59,240
 then you can do dimensionality reduction

1742
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:59,240
 

1743
00:48:57,319 --> 00:49:00,680
 like Auto encoding that gives you a low

1744
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:00,680
 

1745
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:02,180
 dimensional latent code that kind of

1746
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:02,180
 

1747
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:04,640
 captures some of the variation of your

1748
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:04,640
 

1749
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:06,740
 policy space discretize that code then

1750
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:06,740
 

1751
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:08,329
 run map elites within that code to find

1752
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:08,329
 

1753
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:09,799
 everything that's possible and then just

1754
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:09,799
 

1755
00:49:08,329 --> 00:49:11,690
 you can keep repeating this process over

1756
00:49:09,789 --> 00:49:11,690
 

1757
00:49:09,799 --> 00:49:13,670
 and over again to expand outwards in

1758
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,670
 

1759
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:15,319
 high dimensional spaces and find all the

1760
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:15,319
 

1761
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:17,660
 interesting set of things that's out

1762
00:49:15,309 --> 00:49:17,660
 

1763
00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:19,059
 there so that works remarkably well

1764
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:19,059
 

1765
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:21,380
 which is great because that helps us

1766
00:49:19,049 --> 00:49:21,380
 

1767
00:49:19,059 --> 00:49:23,780
 expand on into domains where we have no

1768
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:23,780
 

1769
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:26,809
 idea what even counts is interesting so

1770
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:26,809
 

1771
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:28,549
 I want to talk about another application

1772
00:49:26,799 --> 00:49:28,549
 

1773
00:49:26,809 --> 00:49:30,049
 which recently came out called this go

1774
00:49:28,539 --> 00:49:30,049
 

1775
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:32,150
 explore algorithm which is yet another

1776
00:49:30,039 --> 00:49:32,150
 

1777
00:49:30,049 --> 00:49:34,220
 case where we harnessed the idea of QT

1778
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:34,220
 

1779
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:35,450
 but in a totally different way to do

1780
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:35,450
 

1781
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:38,089
 something to solve a previously

1782
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,089
 

1783
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:39,650
 unsolvable problem so a grand challenge

1784
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:39,650
 

1785
00:49:38,089 --> 00:49:41,270
 in deep reinforcement learning is

1786
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,270
 

1787
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:42,770
 exploration and many of you probably

1788
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:42,770
 

1789
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:44,390
 know that there have been these job

1790
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,390
 

1791
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:47,299
 montezuma's revenge has kind of been

1792
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:47,299
 

1793
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:49,309
 like the challenge in terms of trying to

1794
00:49:47,289 --> 00:49:49,309
 

1795
00:49:47,299 --> 00:49:51,859
 solve sparse reward problems we very

1796
00:49:49,299 --> 00:49:51,859
 

1797
00:49:49,309 --> 00:49:53,240
 infrequently get a reward pit follows an

1798
00:49:51,849 --> 00:49:53,240
 

1799
00:49:51,859 --> 00:49:54,710
 example that's even harder because it's

1800
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:54,710
 

1801
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,839
 actually deceptive because most of the

1802
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,839
 

1803
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:59,480
 time you do worse and so the agents

1804
00:49:56,829 --> 00:49:59,480
 

1805
00:49:56,839 --> 00:50:00,890
 learn to to stand still so what we did

1806
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:00,890
 

1807
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:02,510
 was we wanted to take advantage of some

1808
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,510
 

1809
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:03,980
 of these cutie cutie ideas in this

1810
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,980
 

1811
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:06,140
 algorithm called go explore and it

1812
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:06,140
 

1813
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:08,359
 splits learning into two phases the

1814
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:08,359
 

1815
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:10,119
 first phase is try just try to explore

1816
00:50:08,349 --> 00:50:10,119
 

1817
00:50:08,359 --> 00:50:12,530
 until you know how to solve the problem

1818
00:50:10,109 --> 00:50:12,530
 

1819
00:50:10,119 --> 00:50:14,690
 including finding just like an open leap

1820
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,690
 

1821
00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:16,430
 loop sequence they can solve the problem

1822
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,430
 

1823
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:17,990
 and then in a second phase you'll take

1824
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:17,990
 

1825
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:19,220
 that demonstration of how to solve the

1826
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:19,220
 

1827
00:50:17,990 --> 00:50:20,540
 problem and you'll use imitation

1828
00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:20,540
 

1829
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:21,530
 learning to robusta phi that into a

1830
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:21,530
 

1831
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:23,750
 neural network that can deal with

1832
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,750
 

1833
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:25,220
 stochasticity and what i want to focus

1834
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:25,220
 

1835
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:26,599
 on is the first phase because that's

1836
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:26,599
 

1837
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:27,859
 where we harness quality diversity

1838
00:50:26,589 --> 00:50:27,859
 

1839
00:50:26,599 --> 00:50:30,349
 algorithms so here's not what that

1840
00:50:27,849 --> 00:50:30,349
 

1841
00:50:27,859 --> 00:50:32,390
 algorithm looks like you start in a here

1842
00:50:30,339 --> 00:50:32,390
 

1843
00:50:30,349 --> 00:50:34,490
 which is you start by taking some random

1844
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:34,490
 

1845
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:35,960
 actions and you every place that you end

1846
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,960
 

1847
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:38,030
 up every state you end up in you add

1848
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:38,030
 

1849
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:39,950
 that to your archive and then what you

1850
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:39,950
 

1851
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:42,559
 do is you pull a state out of the

1852
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:42,559
 

1853
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:44,630
 archive you go back to it with no

1854
00:50:42,549 --> 00:50:44,630
 

1855
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:46,309
 exploration added and then you explore

1856
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:46,309
 

1857
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:49,309
 from it and if you get to any new states

1858
00:50:46,299 --> 00:50:49,309
 

1859
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:51,349
 in the archive then you add them to your

1860
00:50:49,299 --> 00:50:51,349
 

1861
00:50:49,309 --> 00:50:53,720
 archive and then here's where the the

1862
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:53,720
 

1863
00:50:51,349 --> 00:50:54,980
 quality comes in in step D if you happen

1864
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:54,980
 

1865
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:56,720
 to get back to a place you've already

1866
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:56,720
 

1867
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:58,490
 been but you get there in a better way

1868
00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:58,490
 

1869
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,900
 either through a shorter more efficient

1870
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:59,900
 

1871
00:50:58,490 --> 00:51:02,059
 trajectory or through a higher

1872
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,059
 

1873
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:03,470
 performing trajectory you swap in to

1874
00:51:02,049 --> 00:51:03,470
 

1875
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:05,809
 that method of getting there as your

1876
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,809
 

1877
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:06,150
 preferred way to get to that cell so if

1878
00:51:05,799 --> 00:51:06,150
 

1879
00:51:05,809 --> 00:51:07,710
 you

1880
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:07,710
 

1881
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:08,880
 about it this is an enhanced version of

1882
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:08,880
 

1883
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:10,859
 Matt police because I learned the

1884
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:10,859
 

1885
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:12,690
 fastest or the highest rewarding way to

1886
00:51:10,849 --> 00:51:12,690
 

1887
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:14,430
 get to this point and that point and

1888
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:14,430
 

1889
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:16,470
 this point in that point I have this set

1890
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:16,470
 

1891
00:51:14,430 --> 00:51:17,760
 of policies which is the best way to get

1892
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:17,760
 

1893
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:20,039
 to all of these different places and

1894
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:20,039
 

1895
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:23,250
 ultimately I'll get have the best way to

1896
00:51:20,029 --> 00:51:23,250
 

1897
00:51:20,039 --> 00:51:25,410
 solve the entire game and to skip over a

1898
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,410
 

1899
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:27,150
 lot of detail if you look at the

1900
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,150
 

1901
00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:29,099
 previous performance on this task it's

1902
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:29,099
 

1903
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:31,529
 usually around zero to a state of the

1904
00:51:29,089 --> 00:51:31,529
 

1905
00:51:29,099 --> 00:51:34,049
 art of around 11,000 before this work

1906
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:34,049
 

1907
00:51:31,529 --> 00:51:35,789
 and the best policy using these ideas

1908
00:51:34,039 --> 00:51:35,789
 

1909
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:37,890
 gets to a score of about eighteen

1910
00:51:35,779 --> 00:51:37,890
 

1911
00:51:35,789 --> 00:51:39,630
 million and scores you know eleven

1912
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:39,630
 

1913
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:40,890
 hundred levels of this game it even

1914
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:40,890
 

1915
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:42,809
 beats the human world record on this

1916
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,809
 

1917
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:45,240
 game of 1.2 million so it's really just

1918
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:45,240
 

1919
00:51:42,809 --> 00:51:47,220
 a step change at what optimization can

1920
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:47,220
 

1921
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:49,099
 do when you kind of embrace the idea of

1922
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:49,099
 

1923
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:51,720
 an expanding repertoire of high-quality

1924
00:51:49,089 --> 00:51:51,720
 

1925
00:51:49,099 --> 00:51:53,579
 policies on pitfall the story is similar

1926
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:53,579
 

1927
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:56,640
 there have been no prior score greater

1928
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:56,640
 

1929
00:51:53,579 --> 00:51:58,589
 than zero on this task and go explore

1930
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:58,589
 

1931
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,910
 basically goes out and gets a max score

1932
00:51:58,579 --> 00:51:59,910
 

1933
00:51:58,589 --> 00:52:01,740
 of one hundred and seven thousand or an

1934
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:01,740
 

1935
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:03,960
 average score of sixty thousand which is

1936
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:03,960
 

1937
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:06,180
 just a dramatic step forward in turn our

1938
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:06,180
 

1939
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:08,190
 ability to solve these hard exploration

1940
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:08,190
 

1941
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:09,960
 problems so I think that this shows the

1942
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:09,960
 

1943
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:11,450
 value of quality diversity algorithms of

1944
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:11,450
 

1945
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:14,069
 collecting a diverse repertoire of

1946
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,069
 

1947
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:14,789
 high-quality things and helped us solve

1948
00:52:14,059 --> 00:52:14,789
 

1949
00:52:14,069 --> 00:52:19,770
 this problem

1950
00:52:14,779 --> 00:52:19,770
 

1951
00:52:14,789 --> 00:52:21,839
 so one another so I want to just briefly

1952
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,839
 

1953
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:24,510
 stop and talk about looking forward a

1954
00:52:21,829 --> 00:52:24,510
 

1955
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:26,670
 little bit in future work here you can

1956
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,670
 

1957
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:29,190
 kind of think about how could we exploit

1958
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:29,190
 

1959
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:30,900
 what's in this map you know we've taken

1960
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:30,900
 

1961
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:33,059
 we've shown you in the nature paper on

1962
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:33,059
 

1963
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:34,410
 robotics and we in demand you showed you

1964
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:34,410
 

1965
00:52:33,059 --> 00:52:36,240
 and go explore two different ways to

1966
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,240
 

1967
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:37,940
 kind of harness what's in there but I

1968
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:37,940
 

1969
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,960
 want to challenge everyone in this room

1970
00:52:37,930 --> 00:52:39,960
 

1971
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:41,339
 who's listening to this tutorial to

1972
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:41,339
 

1973
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:43,109
 think about what could you do in your

1974
00:52:41,329 --> 00:52:43,109
 

1975
00:52:41,339 --> 00:52:45,660
 problem space and with your techniques

1976
00:52:43,099 --> 00:52:45,660
 

1977
00:52:43,109 --> 00:52:47,670
 to take advantage if I gave you a set of

1978
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:47,670
 

1979
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:50,099
 a thousand or ten thousand or fifty

1980
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:50,099
 

1981
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:51,779
 thousand totally different ways to solve

1982
00:52:50,089 --> 00:52:51,779
 

1983
00:52:50,099 --> 00:52:54,000
 the problem each of which is pretty good

1984
00:52:51,769 --> 00:52:54,000
 

1985
00:52:51,779 --> 00:52:56,250
 in its own way so one thing you could do

1986
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:56,250
 

1987
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,900
 is you could use that data to learn

1988
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,900
 

1989
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:59,849
 really good representations of the world

1990
00:52:57,890 --> 00:52:59,849
 

1991
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:01,319
 and how to solve the problems in that

1992
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:01,319
 

1993
00:52:59,849 --> 00:53:03,210
 world like value functions which could

1994
00:53:01,309 --> 00:53:03,210
 

1995
00:53:01,319 --> 00:53:05,099
 aid you with more further exploration

1996
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,099
 

1997
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:06,569
 you could also learn models of the world

1998
00:53:05,089 --> 00:53:06,569
 

1999
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:08,490
 because you know how to fan out and

2000
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:08,490
 

2001
00:53:06,569 --> 00:53:10,079
 explore all these different niches of

2002
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,079
 

2003
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:11,940
 the worlds and different dynamics than

2004
00:53:10,069 --> 00:53:11,940
 

2005
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:13,859
 ways to behave for example if you only

2006
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:13,859
 

2007
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:15,299
 optimized for running robots you might

2008
00:53:13,849 --> 00:53:15,299
 

2009
00:53:13,859 --> 00:53:16,950
 never learn about the physics of flying

2010
00:53:15,289 --> 00:53:16,950
 

2011
00:53:15,299 --> 00:53:18,990
 but if you had a algorithm that produced

2012
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:18,990
 

2013
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:19,320
 flying robots and running robots now you

2014
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:19,320
 

2015
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:20,940
 can

2016
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:20,940
 

2017
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:22,530
 model the physics of flying creatures

2018
00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:22,530
 

2019
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:24,360
 and running creatures and maybe swimming

2020
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:24,360
 

2021
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:26,040
 creatures you might also be able to

2022
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:26,040
 

2023
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:28,230
 learn a lot of really important options

2024
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:28,230
 

2025
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:29,820
 in like a hierarchical RL fashion I can

2026
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:29,820
 

2027
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:31,290
 get from here to here and here to here

2028
00:53:29,810 --> 00:53:31,290
 

2029
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:33,060
 and here to here well those could be

2030
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,060
 

2031
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:35,190
 little atoms that some top level

2032
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:35,190
 

2033
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:36,120
 controller is kind of using to move

2034
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:36,120
 

2035
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:37,830
 around the world

2036
00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:37,830
 

2037
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:38,790
 you could also learn agent models

2038
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:38,790
 

2039
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:40,080
 because you've fanned out you've

2040
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:40,080
 

2041
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:41,640
 interacted with all sorts of different

2042
00:53:40,070 --> 00:53:41,640
 

2043
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:43,200
 agents that if you were only focused on

2044
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:43,200
 

2045
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,790
 optimization maybe you'd never go play

2046
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:44,790
 

2047
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,410
 with the worms in the back corner of

2048
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:46,410
 

2049
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:47,760
 this closet or something but now that

2050
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,760
 

2051
00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:48,960
 you do maybe you could model how those

2052
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:48,960
 

2053
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,180
 agents behave and maybe that's useful

2054
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:51,180
 

2055
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:52,920
 for some reason so I don't know the full

2056
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:52,920
 

2057
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:54,330
 set here at me I would like to see what

2058
00:53:52,910 --> 00:53:54,330
 

2059
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:56,550
 the community does when they're

2060
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,550
 

2061
00:53:54,330 --> 00:54:00,330
 challenged to think about all of this so

2062
00:53:56,540 --> 00:54:00,330
 

2063
00:53:56,550 --> 00:54:03,600
 to conclude here on quality diversity

2064
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:03,600
 

2065
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:05,760
 algorithms we are going to what we think

2066
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:05,760
 

2067
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:08,130
 is really really promising about this

2068
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:08,130
 

2069
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:10,200
 family of optimization algorithms is

2070
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,200
 

2071
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:12,090
 that you can generate this set of

2072
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:12,090
 

2073
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:13,710
 diverse high-quality solutions which is

2074
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:13,710
 

2075
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:15,900
 just really intrinsically interesting to

2076
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:15,900
 

2077
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:17,760
 understand what's out there it gives you

2078
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:17,760
 

2079
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:19,500
 a bunch of options and trade-offs may be

2080
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:19,500
 

2081
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,850
 the top-performing thing isn't what you

2082
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:20,850
 

2083
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:22,490
 want once you see that there's some

2084
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,490
 

2085
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:25,320
 other trade-off you hadn't considered

2086
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,320
 

2087
00:54:22,490 --> 00:54:27,270
 and we think most importantly the

2088
00:54:25,310 --> 00:54:27,270
 

2089
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:28,860
 disease algorithms have a lot of healthy

2090
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:28,860
 

2091
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:31,440
 internal dynamics in terms of what's

2092
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:31,440
 

2093
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:33,240
 going on so they collect this increasing

2094
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:33,240
 

2095
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:35,190
 set of stepping stones that that can be

2096
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:35,190
 

2097
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:37,230
 used as branching off points they have

2098
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:37,230
 

2099
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:39,720
 goal switching so they catch ants on a

2100
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:39,720
 

2101
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:43,170
 wing and serendipity they use that to

2102
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:43,170
 

2103
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:44,820
 avoid local optima and you know as it

2104
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:44,820
 

2105
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:46,590
 has been said you know chance favors the

2106
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:46,590
 

2107
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:49,320
 prepared mind so we want our algorithms

2108
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:49,320
 

2109
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:50,880
 to embody that concept they also build

2110
00:54:49,310 --> 00:54:50,880
 

2111
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:52,260
 on innovations via these adaptive

2112
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:52,260
 

2113
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:53,520
 radiations where you get a central

2114
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:53,520
 

2115
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:54,990
 innovation and then everything can

2116
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:54,990
 

2117
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,220
 radiate out and with all the places

2118
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:56,220
 

2119
00:54:54,990 --> 00:54:58,410
 where it's helpful and serve as a

2120
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:58,410
 

2121
00:54:56,220 --> 00:55:00,720
 foundation for future innovation they

2122
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,720
 

2123
00:54:58,410 --> 00:55:02,580
 learn multiple overlapping curricula and

2124
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:02,580
 

2125
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,870
 bet hedging and ultimately one will work

2126
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:03,870
 

2127
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:05,190
 but ahead of time you wouldn't know

2128
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:05,190
 

2129
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:07,040
 which one that is if you don't kind of

2130
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:07,040
 

2131
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:09,300
 simultaneously push on all of them and

2132
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:09,300
 

2133
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:11,130
 often as we've shown over and over and

2134
00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:11,130
 

2135
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:13,470
 over again even if you are just trying

2136
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:13,470
 

2137
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:15,450
 to solve one ambitious challenge these

2138
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:15,450
 

2139
00:55:13,470 --> 00:55:17,520
 can be the best way to get there because

2140
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,520
 

2141
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:19,410
 of all these healthy dynamics is fan-out

2142
00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:19,410
 

2143
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:21,690
 and don't get trapped by deception and

2144
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,690
 

2145
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:24,060
 sparsity in the search algorithm so with

2146
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,060
 

2147
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:25,050
 that I'm going to flip it over to Joel

2148
00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:25,050
 

2149
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:26,880
 who's going to quickly tell you about

2150
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,880
 

2151
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:27,840
 some other QT ideas in the machine

2152
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:27,840
 

2153
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,850
 learning community and then we're going

2154
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:29,850
 

2155
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:31,530
 to have our Q&A so while Joel is talking

2156
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:31,530
 

2157
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:32,240
 if you have questions for us please come

2158
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:32,240
 

2159
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:33,380
 to the microphone

2160
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:33,380
 

2161
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,910
 we're gonna keep it to about five

2162
00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:34,910
 

2163
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:42,800
 minutes and then we'll press on to the

2164
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:42,800
 

2165
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:45,290
 other subjects thank you thanks Jeff so

2166
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:45,290
 

2167
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:47,869
 at the end of this focus on quality

2168
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,869
 

2169
00:55:45,290 --> 00:55:50,000
 diversity we like to draw attention to a

2170
00:55:47,859 --> 00:55:50,000
 

2171
00:55:47,869 --> 00:55:51,910
 really vein of a really interesting vein

2172
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:51,910
 

2173
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,560
 of work coming out of deep mind on

2174
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:54,560
 

2175
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:56,630
 population-based training and some

2176
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:56,630
 

2177
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:59,089
 connections between that algorithm and

2178
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:59,089
 

2179
00:55:56,630 --> 00:56:01,339
 as used in their alpha star agent to

2180
00:55:59,079 --> 00:56:01,339
 

2181
00:55:59,089 --> 00:56:03,950
 these ideas inspired by a short paper by

2182
00:56:01,329 --> 00:56:03,950
 

2183
00:56:01,339 --> 00:56:05,089
 a real Kumar on so if you're not

2184
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:05,089
 

2185
00:56:03,950 --> 00:56:06,410
 familiar that idea population based

2186
00:56:05,079 --> 00:56:06,410
 

2187
00:56:05,089 --> 00:56:08,390
 training it's a really cool idea and

2188
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,390
 

2189
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:10,250
 recommend that you read the paper it's

2190
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:10,250
 

2191
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:11,960
 motivated by the idea that hyper

2192
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,960
 

2193
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:14,390
 parameters are really important to

2194
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:14,390
 

2195
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:15,950
 getting machine learning and that

2196
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:15,950
 

2197
00:56:14,390 --> 00:56:17,810
 efficient optimization of hyper

2198
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:17,810
 

2199
00:56:15,950 --> 00:56:19,460
 parameters is a really important thing

2200
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,460
 

2201
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:23,330
 to make our algorithms computationally

2202
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:23,330
 

2203
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:25,250
 efficient so one approach you might use

2204
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:25,250
 

2205
00:56:23,330 --> 00:56:26,510
 is to sequentially try different sets of

2206
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:26,510
 

2207
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:28,550
 high parameters like using Bayesian

2208
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,550
 

2209
00:56:26,510 --> 00:56:29,930
 optimization where you find one set of

2210
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:29,930
 

2211
00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:31,460
 high parameters and see how it does and

2212
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,460
 

2213
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:32,270
 use that to inform the next sample you

2214
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:32,270
 

2215
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:34,849
 might do something a little more

2216
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:34,849
 

2217
00:56:32,270 --> 00:56:36,230
 scalable and do something like random

2218
00:56:34,839 --> 00:56:36,230
 

2219
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:38,119
 search where you try a lots of different

2220
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:38,119
 

2221
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:39,530
 hyper members in parallel and the idea

2222
00:56:38,109 --> 00:56:39,530
 

2223
00:56:38,119 --> 00:56:41,510
 in population-based training is that you

2224
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,510
 

2225
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:43,910
 do something like random search for AI

2226
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:43,910
 

2227
00:56:41,510 --> 00:56:45,980
 parameters and as you're running as

2228
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,980
 

2229
00:56:43,910 --> 00:56:47,300
 you're training your albums with these

2230
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:47,300
 

2231
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:49,040
 random set of initially random set of

2232
00:56:47,290 --> 00:56:49,040
 

2233
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:51,170
 hyper parameters you pause training at

2234
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:51,170
 

2235
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:53,630
 some point and when you pause training

2236
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:53,630
 

2237
00:56:51,170 --> 00:56:54,950
 you look at which which algorithms are

2238
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:54,950
 

2239
00:56:53,630 --> 00:56:56,240
 which set of hyper members are

2240
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:56,240
 

2241
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:58,010
 performing better you do sort of a

2242
00:56:56,230 --> 00:56:58,010
 

2243
00:56:56,240 --> 00:57:01,670
 greedy sort of online evolutionary

2244
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,670
 

2245
00:56:58,010 --> 00:57:03,050
 search where you overwrite the poor

2246
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:03,050
 

2247
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:05,000
 performing sets of hyper parameters with

2248
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,000
 

2249
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:07,400
 modifications of the high performing set

2250
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:07,400
 

2251
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:10,220
 and this way you can kind of get an

2252
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:10,220
 

2253
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:11,510
 adaptive schedule of hyper parameters

2254
00:57:10,210 --> 00:57:11,510
 

2255
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:12,800
 that ultimately leads to really nice

2256
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:12,800
 

2257
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:14,680
 improvements in a computationally

2258
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:14,680
 

2259
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:18,170
 efficient way and hyper primary search

2260
00:57:14,670 --> 00:57:18,170
 

2261
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:19,670
 and this has been an idea that's had

2262
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,670
 

2263
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:22,160
 lots of interesting applications so far

2264
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:22,160
 

2265
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:23,359
 helps to stabilize gand training which

2266
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:23,359
 

2267
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:25,760
 is notorious a little bit a little bit

2268
00:57:23,349 --> 00:57:25,760
 

2269
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:27,230
 difficult as we used in the recent

2270
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:27,230
 

2271
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:29,810
 science paper on capture-the-flag

2272
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:29,810
 

2273
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:31,730
 and very recently I think just maybe a

2274
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,730
 

2275
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:33,380
 couple weeks ago there was work out of

2276
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:33,380
 

2277
00:57:31,730 --> 00:57:35,440
 Berkeley on using population-based

2278
00:57:33,370 --> 00:57:35,440
 

2279
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:39,910
 training to make for more efficient

2280
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:39,910
 

2281
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:42,170
 discovery of data augmentation policies

2282
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:42,170
 

2283
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:43,490
 but when a focus right now I'm thinking

2284
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,490
 

2285
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:45,320
 about alpha star so if you're not

2286
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:45,320
 

2287
00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:49,400
 familiar with alpha star it's the

2288
00:57:45,310 --> 00:57:49,400
 

2289
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:51,290
 human performance matching starcraft2

2290
00:57:49,390 --> 00:57:51,290
 

2291
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:53,390
 agents and uses a lot of interesting

2292
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,390
 

2293
00:57:51,290 --> 00:57:55,100
 people learning technologies and one of

2294
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:55,100
 

2295
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:57,140
 the ingredients in this system is is

2296
00:57:55,090 --> 00:57:57,140
 

2297
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:58,220
 population-based training and so in a

2298
00:57:57,130 --> 00:57:58,220
 

2299
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,570
 game like Starcraft there's many

2300
00:57:58,210 --> 00:57:59,570
 

2301
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:01,520
 different strategies you might want to

2302
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,520
 

2303
00:57:59,570 --> 00:58:02,930
 maintain a diversity of strategies so

2304
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:02,930
 

2305
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:06,230
 that you're not overfitting to whatever

2306
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:06,230
 

2307
00:58:02,930 --> 00:58:07,370
 is currently present just just one sort

2308
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:07,370
 

2309
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:09,080
 of strategy can be easily defeated by

2310
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,080
 

2311
00:58:07,370 --> 00:58:13,100
 the other ones and so what they do is

2312
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:13,100
 

2313
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:14,150
 they have a a ongoing league of agents

2314
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:14,150
 

2315
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:16,940
 that are competing with each other and

2316
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:16,940
 

2317
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:19,010
 the idea is that by having a league and

2318
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:19,010
 

2319
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:20,720
 by incentivizing certain agents to to

2320
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,720
 

2321
00:58:19,010 --> 00:58:22,940
 perform differently maybe one agent has

2322
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:22,940
 

2323
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:25,040
 an alerting objective to to kind of beat

2324
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:25,040
 

2325
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:26,870
 another particular agent or to be the

2326
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:26,870
 

2327
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:28,580
 distribution of agents or to use more of

2328
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:28,580
 

2329
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:30,200
 the particular units in StarCraft than

2330
00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:30,200
 

2331
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:32,120
 other agents the idea is to kind of

2332
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:32,120
 

2333
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:36,140
 maintain diversity explicitly in this

2334
00:58:32,110 --> 00:58:36,140
 

2335
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:39,230
 population to to make overall the

2336
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:39,230
 

2337
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:41,780
 emergence of a really robust solution

2338
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:41,780
 

2339
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:43,010
 more possible and so so waiting on the

2340
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:43,010
 

2341
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:44,630
 actual paper but it sounds like from

2342
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,630
 

2343
00:58:43,010 --> 00:58:46,190
 from the blog post that there's a lot of

2344
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:46,190
 

2345
00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:47,870
 interesting may be potential innovations

2346
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:47,870
 

2347
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:51,080
 in QD that are being introduced by this

2348
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:51,080
 

2349
00:58:47,870 --> 00:58:53,960
 and yeah I think we're excited for other

2350
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:53,960
 

2351
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:54,950
 sorts of interesting riffs on population

2352
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:54,950
 

2353
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:57,800
 based training and how it could kind of

2354
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:57,800
 

2355
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:59,600
 push the field forward so with that if

2356
00:58:57,790 --> 00:58:59,600
 

2357
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:01,100
 you want to start thinking about the

2358
00:58:59,590 --> 00:59:01,100
 

2359
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:02,990
 question/answer and reaching towards the

2360
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:02,990
 

2361
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:06,140
 the microphones I will start our

2362
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:06,140
 

2363
00:59:02,990 --> 00:59:07,700
 question answer session now I just just

2364
00:59:06,130 --> 00:59:07,700
 

2365
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:09,020
 to be clear this is the first Q&A it's

2366
00:59:07,690 --> 00:59:09,020
 

2367
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:10,190
 gonna be very fast and then we're going

2368
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:10,190
 

2369
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:11,690
 to get on with two other really cool

2370
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:11,690
 

2371
00:59:10,190 --> 00:59:13,550
 topics from Ken and then we're gonna

2372
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,550
 

2373
00:59:11,690 --> 00:59:15,200
 have a second QA which is hopefully even

2374
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:15,200
 

2375
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:20,330
 longer and can bleed into the break if

2376
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:20,330
 

2377
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:22,340
 people are interested tag and so on okay

2378
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,340
 

2379
00:59:20,330 --> 00:59:25,040
 great thanks for a great time both of

2380
00:59:22,330 --> 00:59:25,040
 

2381
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:27,720
 you this is a more general and sort of

2382
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:27,720
 

2383
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:29,460
 naive question about evolutionary

2384
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:29,460
 

2385
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:32,040
 you're talking about spanning out

2386
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:32,040
 

2387
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:33,930
 diversity in kind of a space of policies

2388
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:33,930
 

2389
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:35,580
 or maybe value functions and I was

2390
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,580
 

2391
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:38,670
 wondering what the evolutionary

2392
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:38,670
 

2393
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:42,390
 algorithm or genetic algorithm community

2394
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:42,390
 

2395
00:59:38,670 --> 00:59:43,650
 thinks of as generalization or as the

2396
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:43,650
 

2397
00:59:42,390 --> 00:59:46,080
 class of problems you're sort of

2398
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:46,080
 

2399
00:59:43,650 --> 00:59:48,150
 training on in the class the class that

2400
00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:48,150
 

2401
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:50,790
 you want to generalize to if there's

2402
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:50,790
 

2403
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:54,120
 that notion like if it's across policies

2404
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:54,120
 

2405
00:59:50,790 --> 00:59:57,540
 or across reward functions how that

2406
00:59:54,110 --> 00:59:57,540
 

2407
00:59:54,120 --> 01:00:00,030
 could translate to you know supervised

2408
00:59:57,530 --> 01:00:00,030
 

2409
00:59:57,540 --> 01:00:02,130
 or unsupervised machine learning yeah I

2410
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:02,130
 

2411
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:03,690
 think it depends on which subset of the

2412
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:03,690
 

2413
01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:05,370
 community and what they're trying to

2414
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,370
 

2415
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:06,540
 achieve I think in a lot of the stuff

2416
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:06,540
 

2417
01:00:05,370 --> 01:00:08,910
 that we've been talking about we follow

2418
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:08,910
 

2419
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:10,170
 more of the RL philosophy which is that

2420
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:10,170
 

2421
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:11,790
 you kind of are just trying to get an

2422
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:11,790
 

2423
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:13,230
 agent that can actually do this thing or

2424
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:13,230
 

2425
01:00:11,790 --> 01:00:15,810
 solve this problem and we don't usually

2426
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:15,810
 

2427
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:17,280
 then switch to something else so in that

2428
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,280
 

2429
01:00:15,810 --> 01:00:19,530
 sense I guess we're guilty of training

2430
01:00:17,270 --> 01:00:19,530
 

2431
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:21,270
 on our test set there has been work

2432
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,270
 

2433
01:00:19,530 --> 01:00:22,680
 including by the work of the Simona

2434
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:22,680
 

2435
01:00:21,270 --> 01:00:24,330
 algorithm that I presented there or we

2436
01:00:22,670 --> 01:00:24,330
 

2437
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:25,770
 did actually train on a set for example

2438
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:25,770
 

2439
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:28,050
 of mazes and then we wanted to

2440
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:28,050
 

2441
01:00:25,770 --> 01:00:30,630
 generalize to different mazes and we're

2442
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:30,630
 

2443
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:32,040
 preoccupied with generalization and then

2444
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:32,040
 

2445
01:00:30,630 --> 01:00:33,600
 obviously the nature paper the

2446
01:00:32,030 --> 01:00:33,600
 

2447
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:35,220
 intelligent trial error in some sense is

2448
01:00:33,590 --> 01:00:35,220
 

2449
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:36,540
 the the grand additive generalization

2450
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:36,540
 

2451
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:38,130
 because you're going from simulation to

2452
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:38,130
 

2453
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:40,620
 try to generalize to the real world in

2454
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:40,620
 

2455
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:42,450
 some cases so I think there you'll see

2456
01:00:40,610 --> 01:00:42,450
 

2457
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:44,010
 all of the above you know under the

2458
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:44,010
 

2459
01:00:42,450 --> 01:00:45,990
 under the tent that depending on what

2460
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,990
 

2461
01:00:44,010 --> 01:00:47,010
 people are working on they either do or

2462
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:47,010
 

2463
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:56,820
 completely ignore the issue

2464
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:56,820
 

2465
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:58,470
 generalization yeah yeah so might be a

2466
01:00:56,810 --> 01:00:58,470
 

2467
01:00:56,820 --> 01:01:02,820
 little bit long winded I apologize in

2468
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:02,820
 

2469
01:00:58,470 --> 01:01:04,830
 advance so creationism creationists have

2470
01:01:02,810 --> 01:01:04,830
 

2471
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:06,540
 this critique of like the evolution of

2472
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:06,540
 

2473
01:01:04,830 --> 01:01:08,010
 the eyeball where they say an eye is

2474
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:08,010
 

2475
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:10,020
 totally useless until you have the whole

2476
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,020
 

2477
01:01:08,010 --> 01:01:11,310
 eye there and then you know people

2478
01:01:10,010 --> 01:01:11,310
 

2479
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:15,000
 respond oh no it's nice to have this

2480
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:15,000
 

2481
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:16,740
 light sensitive spot and so on but

2482
01:01:14,990 --> 01:01:16,740
 

2483
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,770
 there's this underlying question of like

2484
01:01:16,730 --> 01:01:19,770
 

2485
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:21,150
 can you basically just advance via some

2486
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,150
 

2487
01:01:19,770 --> 01:01:24,060
 sort of local search towards your goal

2488
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:24,060
 

2489
01:01:21,150 --> 01:01:25,230
 and it seems like a lot of what you guys

2490
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:25,230
 

2491
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:28,170
 have been talking about is sort of

2492
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:28,170
 

2493
01:01:25,230 --> 01:01:31,770
 saying no that's not the best way to to

2494
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:31,770
 

2495
01:01:28,170 --> 01:01:34,560
 achieve your goal and that reminds me of

2496
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,560
 

2497
01:01:31,770 --> 01:01:35,970
 group selection which as I understand is

2498
01:01:34,550 --> 01:01:35,970
 

2499
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:36,840
 a very controversial and sort of dirty

2500
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:36,840
 

2501
01:01:35,970 --> 01:01:39,420
 word and

2502
01:01:36,830 --> 01:01:39,420
 

2503
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:41,580
 evolution and is not considered

2504
01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:41,580
 

2505
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:43,140
 biologically plausible probably by most

2506
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:43,140
 

2507
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:46,610
 people although I think like yo Wilson

2508
01:01:43,130 --> 01:01:46,610
 

2509
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:49,920
 recently changed his mind about that so

2510
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:49,920
 

2511
01:01:46,610 --> 01:01:51,030
 basically I'm curious you know what you

2512
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:51,030
 

2513
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:53,370
 think about the biological plausibility

2514
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:53,370
 

2515
01:01:51,030 --> 01:01:55,170
 about these sort of techniques that are

2516
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:55,170
 

2517
01:01:53,370 --> 01:01:58,200
 explicitly selecting for diversity as

2518
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:58,200
 

2519
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:59,400
 opposed to just fitness and if you think

2520
01:01:58,190 --> 01:01:59,400
 

2521
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,930
 there's like implications for our

2522
01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:00,930
 

2523
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:06,870
 understanding of evolution and

2524
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:06,870
 

2525
01:02:00,930 --> 01:02:08,940
 evolutionary biology yes it's a really

2526
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:08,940
 

2527
01:02:06,870 --> 01:02:09,960
 interesting question and obviously when

2528
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:09,960
 

2529
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:11,760
 you have biologically inspired

2530
01:02:09,950 --> 01:02:11,760
 

2531
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:13,650
 algorithms there's some hope that it

2532
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:13,650
 

2533
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:16,530
 would connect either to help test

2534
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:16,530
 

2535
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:17,930
 hypotheses in biology or two maybe

2536
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:17,930
 

2537
01:02:16,530 --> 01:02:22,410
 replicate some of the results in biology

2538
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:22,410
 

2539
01:02:17,930 --> 01:02:23,700
 so on group selection I guess I

2540
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:23,700
 

2541
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:24,720
 personally don't have like a strong

2542
01:02:23,690 --> 01:02:24,720
 

2543
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:26,580
 opinion on that

2544
01:02:24,710 --> 01:02:26,580
 

2545
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:30,600
 I think it's an interesting concept and

2546
01:02:26,570 --> 01:02:30,600
 

2547
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:34,290
 maybe it could be useful for some

2548
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:34,290
 

2549
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:37,830
 algorithms so I guess what was the

2550
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:37,830
 

2551
01:02:34,290 --> 01:02:40,380
 second part I'll jump in on the second

2552
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:40,380
 

2553
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:41,220
 part which is is is the the the style of

2554
01:02:40,370 --> 01:02:41,220
 

2555
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:42,720
 things that we're talking about here

2556
01:02:41,210 --> 01:02:42,720
 

2557
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:43,890
 biologically plausible and I think that

2558
01:02:42,710 --> 01:02:43,890
 

2559
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:45,390
 they are and I think that one of the

2560
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,390
 

2561
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:47,430
 really interesting things is that most

2562
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:47,430
 

2563
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:49,290
 people think of evolution as kind of

2564
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:49,290
 

2565
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:50,790
 competition that you like to get a

2566
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:50,790
 

2567
01:02:49,290 --> 01:02:52,260
 better cheetah you have to be faster

2568
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:52,260
 

2569
01:02:50,790 --> 01:02:54,270
 than the other cheetah and you get this

2570
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:54,270
 

2571
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:55,380
 race - faster faster cheetahs but one of

2572
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:55,380
 

2573
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:56,640
 the really interesting things that

2574
01:02:55,370 --> 01:02:56,640
 

2575
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:58,500
 happen in nature with these algorithms

2576
01:02:56,630 --> 01:02:58,500
 

2577
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:00,720
 are trying to capture is that they're

2578
01:02:58,490 --> 01:03:00,720
 

2579
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:02,310
 divergent because you can win the boys

2580
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:02,310
 

2581
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:03,900
 by being up faster cheetah but you can

2582
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:03,900
 

2583
01:03:02,310 --> 01:03:05,760
 also R in the waist by swimming to an

2584
01:03:03,890 --> 01:03:05,760
 

2585
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:07,230
 island where there are no other cats and

2586
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:07,230
 

2587
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,790
 all of a sudden like there's no

2588
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:08,790
 

2589
01:03:07,230 --> 01:03:09,930
 competition at all you have avoided

2590
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:09,930
 

2591
01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:11,610
 competition and that allows you to

2592
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,610
 

2593
01:03:09,930 --> 01:03:14,550
 radiate out and specialize and have an

2594
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:14,550
 

2595
01:03:11,610 --> 01:03:15,870
 opportunity to kind of maybe figure out

2596
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:15,870
 

2597
01:03:14,550 --> 01:03:17,040
 a totally different solution to a

2598
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:17,040
 

2599
01:03:15,870 --> 01:03:19,260
 problem it has nothing to do with being

2600
01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:19,260
 

2601
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:21,480
 a faster cheetah and so what you see in

2602
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:21,480
 

2603
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:23,040
 nature is the creation of Nicias on the

2604
01:03:21,470 --> 01:03:23,040
 

2605
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:25,590
 backs of niches on the backs of niches

2606
01:03:23,030 --> 01:03:25,590
 

2607
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:27,450
 that once you have for example tall

2608
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:27,450
 

2609
01:03:25,590 --> 01:03:28,920
 leaves you can like solve that niche by

2610
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:28,920
 

2611
01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:30,750
 being a giraffe or by being a

2612
01:03:28,910 --> 01:03:30,750
 

2613
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:32,310
 caterpillar and it's not all about

2614
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:32,310
 

2615
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:34,080
 optimization to get better and better

2616
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:34,080
 

2617
01:03:32,310 --> 01:03:36,120
 and better but actually that there are

2618
01:03:34,070 --> 01:03:36,120
 

2619
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:37,920
 all sorts of opportunities to avoid

2620
01:03:36,110 --> 01:03:37,920
 

2621
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:40,020
 competition and come up with a wildly

2622
01:03:37,910 --> 01:03:40,020
 

2623
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:41,550
 different solution and I would speculate

2624
01:03:40,010 --> 01:03:41,550
 

2625
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:43,350
 and this is a may be totally

2626
01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:43,350
 

2627
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:44,790
 controversial I shouldn't be speculating

2628
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:44,790
 

2629
01:03:43,350 --> 01:03:45,450
 live in front of all these people

2630
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:45,450
 

2631
01:03:44,790 --> 01:03:47,520
 but if

2632
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:47,520
 

2633
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:50,280
 just set up the reward function to be

2634
01:03:47,510 --> 01:03:50,280
 

2635
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:52,230
 like you know like distance like

2636
01:03:50,270 --> 01:03:52,230
 

2637
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:54,119
 focusing on reading letter as far away

2638
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:54,119
 

2639
01:03:52,230 --> 01:03:55,619
 like human vision and that's all you

2640
01:03:54,109 --> 01:03:55,619
 

2641
01:03:54,119 --> 01:03:57,869
 hammered on you wouldn't have gotten it

2642
01:03:55,609 --> 01:03:57,869
 

2643
01:03:55,619 --> 01:03:59,790
 without the diversion like tons and tons

2644
01:03:57,859 --> 01:03:59,790
 

2645
01:03:57,869 --> 01:04:01,140
 of niches sometimes it benefited from a

2646
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:01,140
 

2647
01:03:59,790 --> 01:04:02,790
 light spot or detecting a shadow

2648
01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:02,790
 

2649
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:04,950
 swimming over me and all these different

2650
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:04,950
 

2651
01:04:02,790 --> 01:04:06,780
 and optimization problems we wouldn't

2652
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:06,780
 

2653
01:04:04,950 --> 01:04:08,550
 have gotten the frequent conversion

2654
01:04:06,770 --> 01:04:08,550
 

2655
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:10,650
 evolution of vision which was a really

2656
01:04:08,540 --> 01:04:10,650
 

2657
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:12,119
 complicated thing because there would

2658
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:12,119
 

2659
01:04:10,650 --> 01:04:13,230
 have been a deception and local optima

2660
01:04:12,109 --> 01:04:13,230
 

2661
01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:14,940
 we would have gotten stuck on them it's

2662
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:14,940
 

2663
01:04:13,230 --> 01:04:16,980
 because of this diversions that we got

2664
01:04:14,930 --> 01:04:16,980
 

2665
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:18,690
 convergent evolution of eyes over and

2666
01:04:16,970 --> 01:04:18,690
 

2667
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:20,160
 over and over again we have one more

2668
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:20,160
 

2669
01:04:18,690 --> 01:04:21,359
 minute unfortunately so let's take one

2670
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:21,359
 

2671
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:23,369
 more question that will hold the rest of

2672
01:04:21,349 --> 01:04:23,369
 

2673
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:24,750
 the questions for the second Q&A if you

2674
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:24,750
 

2675
01:04:23,369 --> 01:04:28,500
 don't mind then you've been waiting

2676
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:28,500
 

2677
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:30,570
 patiently over there testing all right

2678
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:30,570
 

2679
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:35,190
 you kind of spoke about this just right

2680
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:35,190
 

2681
01:04:30,570 --> 01:04:37,349
 now but when you were explaining in your

2682
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:37,349
 

2683
01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:38,460
 talk you were talking about multiple

2684
01:04:37,339 --> 01:04:38,460
 

2685
01:04:37,349 --> 01:04:40,200
 objective problems

2686
01:04:38,450 --> 01:04:40,200
 

2687
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:42,390
 what does this look like for a many

2688
01:04:40,190 --> 01:04:42,390
 

2689
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:43,740
 objective problem and then following

2690
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:43,740
 

2691
01:04:42,390 --> 01:04:49,349
 that does that even matter when you're

2692
01:04:43,730 --> 01:04:49,349
 

2693
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:51,180
 talking about novelty so I think all of

2694
01:04:49,339 --> 01:04:51,180
 

2695
01:04:49,349 --> 01:04:52,440
 these ideas apply even better with many

2696
01:04:51,170 --> 01:04:52,440
 

2697
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:53,790
 objective problems so one of the things

2698
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:53,790
 

2699
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:55,650
 that I wanted to kind of convey in that

2700
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:55,650
 

2701
01:04:53,790 --> 01:04:58,109
 matter that innovation engines plot it's

2702
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:58,109
 

2703
01:04:55,650 --> 01:04:59,819
 like the more problems that you add do

2704
01:04:58,099 --> 01:04:59,819
 

2705
01:04:58,109 --> 01:05:01,619
 these things putting aside compute which

2706
01:04:59,809 --> 01:05:01,619
 

2707
01:04:59,819 --> 01:05:02,670
 is a legitimate concern that we you know

2708
01:05:01,609 --> 01:05:02,670
 

2709
01:05:01,619 --> 01:05:04,740
 want to talk about but putting aside

2710
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:04,740
 

2711
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:06,180
 compute the more the merrier because you

2712
01:05:04,730 --> 01:05:06,180
 

2713
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:07,560
 have more curricula you have more

2714
01:05:06,170 --> 01:05:07,560
 

2715
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:08,970
 opportunities for goal switching you

2716
01:05:07,550 --> 01:05:08,970
 

2717
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:10,920
 have more opportunities to kind of go

2718
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,920
 

2719
01:05:08,970 --> 01:05:13,020
 around local optima and then come back

2720
01:05:10,910 --> 01:05:13,020
 

2721
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:14,849
 and solve a problem and these things

2722
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:14,849
 

2723
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:16,170
 ultimately you know put if you had

2724
01:05:14,839 --> 01:05:16,170
 

2725
01:05:14,849 --> 01:05:17,640
 enough compute you could put in a

2726
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:17,640
 

2727
01:05:16,170 --> 01:05:19,230
 million different objectives and you get

2728
01:05:17,630 --> 01:05:19,230
 

2729
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:20,369
 a million two wildly different solutions

2730
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:20,369
 

2731
01:05:19,230 --> 01:05:22,319
 but it's not like doing a million

2732
01:05:20,359 --> 01:05:22,319
 

2733
01:05:20,369 --> 01:05:24,210
 separate optimizations you're sharing

2734
01:05:22,309 --> 01:05:24,210
 

2735
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:26,160
 compute you have like innovations that

2736
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:26,160
 

2737
01:05:24,210 --> 01:05:27,510
 kind of get built upon and built upon so

2738
01:05:26,150 --> 01:05:27,510
 

2739
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:29,250
 to some extent it's like a complexity

2740
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:29,250
 

2741
01:05:27,510 --> 01:05:30,720
 ratchet if you will where you get more

2742
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:30,720
 

2743
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:32,460
 and more complex and more and better

2744
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:32,460
 

2745
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:34,079
 things kind of over time fanning out

2746
01:05:32,450 --> 01:05:34,079
 

2747
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:35,430
 through the space of you know

2748
01:05:34,069 --> 01:05:35,430
 

2749
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:36,660
 potentially an infinite number of

2750
01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:36,660
 

2751
01:05:35,430 --> 01:05:38,880
 objectives and we didn't have to worry

2752
01:05:36,650 --> 01:05:38,880
 

2753
01:05:36,660 --> 01:05:40,440
 about compute so I think there's a lot

2754
01:05:38,870 --> 01:05:40,440
 

2755
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:41,880
 of healthy this is probably in my

2756
01:05:40,430 --> 01:05:41,880
 

2757
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:43,079
 opinion the best way most of the multi

2758
01:05:41,870 --> 01:05:43,079
 

2759
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:44,760
 objective algorithms don't scale very

2760
01:05:43,069 --> 01:05:44,760
 

2761
01:05:43,079 --> 01:05:46,230
 well too many objectives but these

2762
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:46,230
 

2763
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:47,550
 things scale beautifully you just pour

2764
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:47,550
 

2765
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:50,369
 and more compute and you get more

2766
01:05:47,540 --> 01:05:50,369
 

2767
01:05:47,550 --> 01:05:52,230
 performance okay with that we're going

2768
01:05:50,359 --> 01:05:52,230
 

2769
01:05:50,369 --> 01:05:53,430
 to please save your questions I know

2770
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:53,430
 

2771
01:05:52,230 --> 01:05:54,599
 there are a lot and we've sorry to cut

2772
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:54,599
 

2773
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:56,190
 them off but we'll have plenty of time

2774
01:05:54,589 --> 01:05:56,190
 

2775
01:05:54,599 --> 01:05:57,160
 afterwards for more we're not going to

2776
01:05:56,180 --> 01:05:57,160
 

2777
01:05:56,190 --> 01:05:59,319
 hear from Ken Stan

2778
01:05:57,150 --> 01:05:59,319
 

2779
01:05:57,160 --> 01:06:01,869
 on a variety of fascinating subjects

2780
01:05:59,309 --> 01:06:01,869
 

2781
01:05:59,319 --> 01:06:04,019
 including first up I believe open-ended

2782
01:06:01,859 --> 01:06:04,019
 

2783
01:06:01,869 --> 01:06:04,019
 this

2784
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:11,500
 

2785
01:06:11,510 --> 01:06:14,140
 yes

2786
01:06:18,309 --> 01:06:18,309
 

2787
01:06:18,319 --> 01:06:24,829
 okay and I think that a tutorial on

2788
01:06:22,870 --> 01:06:24,829
 

2789
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:28,130
 population based search would not be

2790
01:06:24,819 --> 01:06:28,130
 

2791
01:06:24,829 --> 01:06:30,169
 complete without some discussion of the

2792
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:30,169
 

2793
01:06:28,130 --> 01:06:31,519
 the challenge of open-endedness and I

2794
01:06:30,159 --> 01:06:31,519
 

2795
01:06:30,169 --> 01:06:32,959
 called the grand challenge of open

2796
01:06:31,509 --> 01:06:32,959
 

2797
01:06:31,519 --> 01:06:35,119
 endedness and I'm glad to have this

2798
01:06:32,949 --> 01:06:35,119
 

2799
01:06:32,959 --> 01:06:36,739
 opportunity to talk about this this

2800
01:06:35,109 --> 01:06:36,739
 

2801
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:38,539
 grand challenge because a lot of people

2802
01:06:36,729 --> 01:06:38,539
 

2803
01:06:36,739 --> 01:06:40,819
 don't really know about it but it's

2804
01:06:38,529 --> 01:06:40,819
 

2805
01:06:38,539 --> 01:06:42,829
 really a fundamental and exciting

2806
01:06:40,809 --> 01:06:42,829
 

2807
01:06:40,819 --> 01:06:44,809
 opportunity and I hope I can encourage

2808
01:06:42,819 --> 01:06:44,809
 

2809
01:06:42,829 --> 01:06:46,939
 some people to think about it who

2810
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:46,939
 

2811
01:06:44,809 --> 01:06:49,579
 weren't aware of the of the challenge

2812
01:06:46,929 --> 01:06:49,579
 

2813
01:06:46,939 --> 01:06:51,439
 that I'm about to describe so we've been

2814
01:06:49,569 --> 01:06:51,439
 

2815
01:06:49,579 --> 01:06:53,329
 talking about divergent search really I

2816
01:06:51,429 --> 01:06:53,329
 

2817
01:06:51,439 --> 01:06:54,709
 mean we're we're more familiar with

2818
01:06:53,319 --> 01:06:54,709
 

2819
01:06:53,329 --> 01:06:56,419
 thinking convergently but we've been

2820
01:06:54,699 --> 01:06:56,419
 

2821
01:06:54,709 --> 01:06:59,150
 talking about these divergent algorithms

2822
01:06:56,409 --> 01:06:59,150
 

2823
01:06:56,419 --> 01:07:00,499
 that try to find many interesting points

2824
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:00,499
 

2825
01:06:59,150 --> 01:07:03,890
 in a space and sort of show what's

2826
01:07:00,489 --> 01:07:03,890
 

2827
01:07:00,499 --> 01:07:06,529
 possible or at least of any interest but

2828
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:06,529
 

2829
01:07:03,890 --> 01:07:08,839
 if you think about it in any given

2830
01:07:06,519 --> 01:07:08,839
 

2831
01:07:06,529 --> 01:07:10,459
 domain if we choose a domain like say

2832
01:07:08,829 --> 01:07:10,459
 

2833
01:07:08,839 --> 01:07:13,489
 warp robots that we want to be able to

2834
01:07:10,449 --> 01:07:13,489
 

2835
01:07:10,459 --> 01:07:15,890
 walk in different ways what is possible

2836
01:07:13,479 --> 01:07:15,890
 

2837
01:07:13,489 --> 01:07:18,499
 is at least of any interest to us is

2838
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:18,499
 

2839
01:07:15,890 --> 01:07:20,239
 finite if we choose any given domain the

2840
01:07:18,489 --> 01:07:20,239
 

2841
01:07:18,499 --> 01:07:22,999
 amount of quadrupedal gates that we can

2842
01:07:20,229 --> 01:07:22,999
 

2843
01:07:20,239 --> 01:07:24,409
 find that are of any interest and so it

2844
01:07:22,989 --> 01:07:24,409
 

2845
01:07:22,999 --> 01:07:26,029
 is interesting to think about whether

2846
01:07:24,399 --> 01:07:26,029
 

2847
01:07:24,409 --> 01:07:29,419
 there are algorithms that don't just

2848
01:07:26,019 --> 01:07:29,419
 

2849
01:07:26,029 --> 01:07:32,119
 find what's possible but also invent

2850
01:07:29,409 --> 01:07:32,119
 

2851
01:07:29,419 --> 01:07:34,309
 endless new possibilities in other words

2852
01:07:32,109 --> 01:07:34,309
 

2853
01:07:32,119 --> 01:07:35,839
 if we found all the possible ways that a

2854
01:07:34,299 --> 01:07:35,839
 

2855
01:07:34,309 --> 01:07:37,519
 quadruped ed can walk then let's move

2856
01:07:35,829 --> 01:07:37,519
 

2857
01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:40,009
 past quadrupeds and find a new problem

2858
01:07:37,509 --> 01:07:40,009
 

2859
01:07:37,519 --> 01:07:43,039
 and use the skills that we've gained to

2860
01:07:39,999 --> 01:07:43,039
 

2861
01:07:40,009 --> 01:07:44,299
 solve new problems and forever and this

2862
01:07:43,029 --> 01:07:44,299
 

2863
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:47,049
 is open-endedness and I'm going to sort

2864
01:07:44,289 --> 01:07:47,049
 

2865
01:07:44,299 --> 01:07:49,849
 of illustrate it in some more depth so

2866
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:49,849
 

2867
01:07:47,049 --> 01:07:52,279
 QD which we've been talking about seems

2868
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:52,279
 

2869
01:07:49,849 --> 01:07:55,729
 to get close to this issue but it's not

2870
01:07:52,269 --> 01:07:55,729
 

2871
01:07:52,279 --> 01:07:57,979
 quite there because this is now this is

2872
01:07:55,719 --> 01:07:57,979
 

2873
01:07:55,729 --> 01:07:59,390
 not how to learn something like this is

2874
01:07:57,969 --> 01:07:59,390
 

2875
01:07:57,979 --> 01:08:00,679
 usually what would be doing machine

2876
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:00,679
 

2877
01:07:59,390 --> 01:08:02,150
 learning as we say we have problems

2878
01:08:00,669 --> 01:08:02,150
 

2879
01:08:00,679 --> 01:08:03,919
 we're going to try to learn solutions to

2880
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:03,919
 

2881
01:08:02,150 --> 01:08:05,959
 these problems but really this is like

2882
01:08:03,909 --> 01:08:05,959
 

2883
01:08:03,919 --> 01:08:09,169
 is there such a thing as an algorithm

2884
01:08:05,949 --> 01:08:09,169
 

2885
01:08:05,959 --> 01:08:10,219
 that will learn everything and so like

2886
01:08:09,159 --> 01:08:10,219
 

2887
01:08:09,169 --> 01:08:11,749
 we can think about something like a

2888
01:08:10,209 --> 01:08:11,749
 

2889
01:08:10,219 --> 01:08:12,979
 human learning to play a video game I

2890
01:08:11,739 --> 01:08:12,979
 

2891
01:08:11,749 --> 01:08:14,239
 mean that's inspired a lot of

2892
01:08:12,969 --> 01:08:14,239
 

2893
01:08:12,979 --> 01:08:15,919
 reinforcement learning we've learnt

2894
01:08:14,229 --> 01:08:15,919
 

2895
01:08:14,239 --> 01:08:18,319
 we've seen algorithms learned to play

2896
01:08:15,909 --> 01:08:18,319
 

2897
01:08:15,919 --> 01:08:20,270
 video games and that's interesting but

2898
01:08:18,309 --> 01:08:20,270
 

2899
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:23,000
 the history of all of human invention is

2900
01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:23,000
 

2901
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:24,380
 beyond just interesting in the history

2902
01:08:22,990 --> 01:08:24,380
 

2903
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:28,069
 of human invention is something that

2904
01:08:24,370 --> 01:08:28,069
 

2905
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:29,989
 humans did and so there are algorithmic

2906
01:08:28,059 --> 01:08:29,989
 

2907
01:08:28,069 --> 01:08:31,910
 principles behind that kind of a

2908
01:08:29,979 --> 01:08:31,910
 

2909
01:08:29,989 --> 01:08:34,100
 or something like natural evolution

2910
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:34,100
 

2911
01:08:31,910 --> 01:08:35,569
 which is the ongoing creation of all the

2912
01:08:34,090 --> 01:08:35,569
 

2913
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:37,819
 diversity of life on earth retrieve

2914
01:08:35,559 --> 01:08:37,819
 

2915
01:08:35,569 --> 01:08:40,520
 alluded to before and this talk and so

2916
01:08:37,809 --> 01:08:40,520
 

2917
01:08:37,819 --> 01:08:42,710
 like this Tree of Life is interesting in

2918
01:08:40,510 --> 01:08:42,710
 

2919
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:45,440
 some sense because it's only one run of

2920
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:45,440
 

2921
01:08:42,710 --> 01:08:47,239
 something it's not like there's a

2922
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:47,239
 

2923
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:48,380
 separate run for every creature and we

2924
01:08:47,229 --> 01:08:48,380
 

2925
01:08:47,239 --> 01:08:50,270
 found all these creatures through

2926
01:08:48,370 --> 01:08:50,270
 

2927
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:51,739
 different optimizations rather this

2928
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:51,739
 

2929
01:08:50,270 --> 01:08:53,569
 isn't actually this isn't actually

2930
01:08:51,729 --> 01:08:53,569
 

2931
01:08:51,739 --> 01:08:55,819
 optimization this is something else this

2932
01:08:53,559 --> 01:08:55,819
 

2933
01:08:53,569 --> 01:08:57,830
 is open-endedness in a single run going

2934
01:08:55,809 --> 01:08:57,830
 

2935
01:08:55,819 --> 01:09:00,020
 more than a billion years and it never

2936
01:08:57,820 --> 01:09:00,020
 

2937
01:08:57,830 --> 01:09:01,759
 seems to stop inventing new things and

2938
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:01,759
 

2939
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:04,009
 in fact it's interesting just to

2940
01:09:01,749 --> 01:09:04,009
 

2941
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:06,170
 consider that this doesn't require human

2942
01:09:03,999 --> 01:09:06,170
 

2943
01:09:04,009 --> 01:09:07,790
 intelligence like a process like this

2944
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:07,790
 

2945
01:09:06,170 --> 01:09:09,589
 like this evolutionary process of course

2946
01:09:07,780 --> 01:09:09,589
 

2947
01:09:07,790 --> 01:09:11,210
 there was not human intelligence behind

2948
01:09:09,579 --> 01:09:11,210
 

2949
01:09:09,589 --> 01:09:13,219
 it and yet it's the most prolific

2950
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,219
 

2951
01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:15,770
 creative process that probably we've

2952
01:09:13,209 --> 01:09:15,770
 

2953
01:09:13,219 --> 01:09:17,060
 ever seen and yet somewhere inside of

2954
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:17,060
 

2955
01:09:15,770 --> 01:09:19,520
 that there's human level intelligence

2956
01:09:17,050 --> 01:09:19,520
 

2957
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:22,190
 like this this tiny moment in this

2958
01:09:19,510 --> 01:09:22,190
 

2959
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:23,960
 endless saga and yet it is created by

2960
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:23,960
 

2961
01:09:22,190 --> 01:09:26,029
 something that itself does not require a

2962
01:09:23,950 --> 01:09:26,029
 

2963
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:27,410
 human level and so basically what a

2964
01:09:26,019 --> 01:09:27,410
 

2965
01:09:26,029 --> 01:09:29,509
 process like this is is basically a

2966
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:29,509
 

2967
01:09:27,410 --> 01:09:31,100
 process of endless surprises but you

2968
01:09:29,499 --> 01:09:31,100
 

2969
01:09:29,509 --> 01:09:32,450
 can't predict at the outset or at any

2970
01:09:31,090 --> 01:09:32,450
 

2971
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:35,390
 event point where it might go in the

2972
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:35,390
 

2973
01:09:32,450 --> 01:09:37,250
 future and it just keeps going and going

2974
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:37,250
 

2975
01:09:35,390 --> 01:09:40,100
 and look at the things that it creates

2976
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:40,100
 

2977
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:42,140
 like these are really really remarkable

2978
01:09:40,090 --> 01:09:42,140
 

2979
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:44,330
 and amazing discoveries beyond our

2980
01:09:42,130 --> 01:09:44,330
 

2981
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:47,060
 capabilities in engineering today like

2982
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:47,060
 

2983
01:09:44,330 --> 01:09:49,850
 photosynthesis or flight the flight of

2984
01:09:47,050 --> 01:09:49,850
 

2985
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:52,549
 birds or human level intelligence in the

2986
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:52,549
 

2987
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:54,469
 brain all in one single run very

2988
01:09:52,539 --> 01:09:54,469
 

2989
01:09:52,549 --> 01:09:56,810
 different divergent types of discoveries

2990
01:09:54,459 --> 01:09:56,810
 

2991
01:09:54,469 --> 01:10:00,320
 but all in the same optimization process

2992
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:00,320
 

2993
01:09:56,810 --> 01:10:01,910
 now something like QD seems to move in a

2994
01:10:00,310 --> 01:10:01,910
 

2995
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:03,170
 direction like this right because it's

2996
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:03,170
 

2997
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:04,730
 saying that like we're going to be

2998
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:04,730
 

2999
01:10:03,170 --> 01:10:05,930
 fanning out into the space of what's

3000
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:05,930
 

3001
01:10:04,730 --> 01:10:08,210
 possible and trying to collect the

3002
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:08,210
 

3003
01:10:05,930 --> 01:10:11,960
 highest quality we can all across that

3004
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:11,960
 

3005
01:10:08,210 --> 01:10:13,730
 space but this isn't really like QD if

3006
01:10:11,950 --> 01:10:13,730
 

3007
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:16,489
 you think about it because QD doesn't

3008
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:16,489
 

3009
01:10:13,730 --> 01:10:18,620
 invent new problems like we made we may

3010
01:10:16,479 --> 01:10:18,620
 

3011
01:10:16,489 --> 01:10:19,880
 solve the problem of ambulation on land

3012
01:10:18,610 --> 01:10:19,880
 

3013
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:22,120
 but that doesn't mean anything about

3014
01:10:19,870 --> 01:10:22,120
 

3015
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:24,920
 flight and we never would go there and

3016
01:10:22,110 --> 01:10:24,920
 

3017
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:26,239
 it and there's some other ideas that are

3018
01:10:24,910 --> 01:10:26,239
 

3019
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:28,640
 floating around that actually are

3020
01:10:26,229 --> 01:10:28,640
 

3021
01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:31,330
 related to open endedness but none of

3022
01:10:28,630 --> 01:10:31,330
 

3023
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:33,980
 them are quite there like reasons again

3024
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:33,980
 

3025
01:10:31,330 --> 01:10:35,270
 again does seem to generate new stuff

3026
01:10:33,970 --> 01:10:35,270
 

3027
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:37,610
 right I mean it can generate images

3028
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:37,610
 

3029
01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:39,590
 you've never seen before for example but

3030
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,590
 

3031
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:41,760
 if you think about it if you exposed

3032
01:10:39,580 --> 01:10:41,760
 

3033
01:10:39,590 --> 01:10:43,349
 again to billions of flatworms and

3034
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:43,349
 

3035
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:45,599
 are actually our ancestors that we

3036
01:10:43,339 --> 01:10:45,599
 

3037
01:10:43,349 --> 01:10:48,030
 evolved from flatworms you'll never see

3038
01:10:45,589 --> 01:10:48,030
 

3039
01:10:45,599 --> 01:10:50,070
 a human come out of it because what

3040
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:50,070
 

3041
01:10:48,030 --> 01:10:51,900
 again does interpolates among the points

3042
01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:51,900
 

3043
01:10:50,070 --> 01:10:53,670
 that it's already seen it will not

3044
01:10:51,890 --> 01:10:53,670
 

3045
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:55,519
 extrapolate billions of years into the

3046
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:55,519
 

3047
01:10:53,670 --> 01:10:58,289
 future to something truly new and novel

3048
01:10:55,509 --> 01:10:58,289
 

3049
01:10:55,519 --> 01:11:00,780
 and so there's something beyond this

3050
01:10:58,279 --> 01:11:00,780
 

3051
01:10:58,289 --> 01:11:01,710
 kind of generativity that we're talking

3052
01:11:00,770 --> 01:11:01,710
 

3053
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:04,409
 about when we're talking about open

3054
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:04,409
 

3055
01:11:01,710 --> 01:11:06,630
 endedness there are also ideas like self

3056
01:11:04,399 --> 01:11:06,630
 

3057
01:11:04,409 --> 01:11:07,949
 play which is also related to something

3058
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:07,949
 

3059
01:11:06,630 --> 01:11:11,699
 called coevolution which we'll talk

3060
01:11:07,939 --> 01:11:11,699
 

3061
01:11:07,949 --> 01:11:14,789
 about a bit more both of them which

3062
01:11:11,689 --> 01:11:14,789
 

3063
01:11:11,699 --> 01:11:16,880
 which I also touch sort of on the road

3064
01:11:14,779 --> 01:11:16,880
 

3065
01:11:14,789 --> 01:11:19,469
 towards this open endedness concept

3066
01:11:16,870 --> 01:11:19,469
 

3067
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:20,789
 which is that like if you have a

3068
01:11:19,459 --> 01:11:20,789
 

3069
01:11:19,469 --> 01:11:22,530
 competition where things are playing

3070
01:11:20,779 --> 01:11:22,530
 

3071
01:11:20,789 --> 01:11:23,820
 against each other you get this kind of

3072
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:23,820
 

3073
01:11:22,530 --> 01:11:25,679
 arms race dynamic where there's a

3074
01:11:23,810 --> 01:11:25,679
 

3075
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:27,119
 ratcheting effect and maybe there's

3076
01:11:25,669 --> 01:11:27,119
 

3077
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:29,639
 something in there where you get a

3078
01:11:27,109 --> 01:11:29,639
 

3079
01:11:27,119 --> 01:11:30,780
 diversity of strategies that then fan

3080
01:11:29,629 --> 01:11:30,780
 

3081
01:11:29,639 --> 01:11:33,960
 out into the space of what's possible

3082
01:11:30,770 --> 01:11:33,960
 

3083
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:35,250
 but the thing is even there like if you

3084
01:11:33,950 --> 01:11:35,250
 

3085
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:36,389
 have something like alphago and it's

3086
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:36,389
 

3087
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:37,710
 playing go well it's only going to

3088
01:11:36,379 --> 01:11:37,710
 

3089
01:11:36,389 --> 01:11:39,300
 improve it go right like you're never

3090
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:39,300
 

3091
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:42,210
 going to invent a new game and then come

3092
01:11:39,290 --> 01:11:42,210
 

3093
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:45,539
 up with something else and so there will

3094
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:45,539
 

3095
01:11:42,210 --> 01:11:48,929
 never be a new game in town so what kind

3096
01:11:45,529 --> 01:11:48,929
 

3097
01:11:45,539 --> 01:11:50,519
 of algorithm is open-endedness and on

3098
01:11:48,919 --> 01:11:50,519
 

3099
01:11:48,929 --> 01:11:51,659
 one characterization that I like for

3100
01:11:50,509 --> 01:11:51,659
 

3101
01:11:50,519 --> 01:11:53,789
 this is sort of like it's the

3102
01:11:51,649 --> 01:11:53,789
 

3103
01:11:51,659 --> 01:11:55,349
 never-ending algorithm and algorithm

3104
01:11:53,779 --> 01:11:55,349
 

3105
01:11:53,789 --> 01:11:56,550
 that you would never want to stop and

3106
01:11:55,339 --> 01:11:56,550
 

3107
01:11:55,349 --> 01:11:57,960
 that you'd be willing to come back a

3108
01:11:56,540 --> 01:11:57,960
 

3109
01:11:56,550 --> 01:11:59,099
 billion years from now and see what's

3110
01:11:57,950 --> 01:11:59,099
 

3111
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:01,320
 happening because it would still be

3112
01:11:59,089 --> 01:12:01,320
 

3113
01:11:59,099 --> 01:12:02,670
 interesting and it's interesting to

3114
01:12:01,310 --> 01:12:02,670
 

3115
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:03,239
 consider that there is nothing like that

3116
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:03,239
 

3117
01:12:02,670 --> 01:12:04,920
 right now

3118
01:12:03,229 --> 01:12:04,920
 

3119
01:12:03,239 --> 01:12:07,289
 I don't think there's a single algorithm

3120
01:12:04,910 --> 01:12:07,289
 

3121
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:08,820
 someone can point to right now where it

3122
01:12:07,279 --> 01:12:08,820
 

3123
01:12:07,289 --> 01:12:10,199
 would be worth coming back in a billion

3124
01:12:08,810 --> 01:12:10,199
 

3125
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:12,269
 years if we could run it for that long

3126
01:12:10,189 --> 01:12:12,269
 

3127
01:12:10,199 --> 01:12:15,570
 and earth is kind of this never-ending

3128
01:12:12,259 --> 01:12:15,570
 

3129
01:12:12,269 --> 01:12:17,760
 algorithm and so that's sometimes

3130
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:17,760
 

3131
01:12:15,570 --> 01:12:19,469
 referred to as open-ended evolution but

3132
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:19,469
 

3133
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:20,429
 I think we should more generally talk

3134
01:12:19,459 --> 01:12:20,429
 

3135
01:12:19,469 --> 01:12:22,980
 about open-endedness

3136
01:12:20,419 --> 01:12:22,980
 

3137
01:12:20,429 --> 01:12:25,530
 because this isn't just about evolution

3138
01:12:22,970 --> 01:12:25,530
 

3139
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:27,570
 although we used it as a motivator this

3140
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:27,570
 

3141
01:12:25,530 --> 01:12:30,300
 is about all kinds of processes that

3142
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:30,300
 

3143
01:12:27,570 --> 01:12:32,250
 have this property like open-endedness

3144
01:12:30,290 --> 01:12:32,250
 

3145
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:34,380
 refers to like the history of all of

3146
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:34,380
 

3147
01:12:32,250 --> 01:12:35,820
 human innovation all of the inventions

3148
01:12:34,370 --> 01:12:35,820
 

3149
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:38,519
 that we've ever created in a single

3150
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:38,519
 

3151
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:40,050
 process it's not an optimization process

3152
01:12:38,509 --> 01:12:40,050
 

3153
01:12:38,519 --> 01:12:41,309
 where there's one uber invention that

3154
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:41,309
 

3155
01:12:40,050 --> 01:12:42,630
 we're trying to aim towards and

3156
01:12:41,299 --> 01:12:42,630
 

3157
01:12:41,309 --> 01:12:44,610
 everything else is just a stepping stone

3158
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:44,610
 

3159
01:12:42,630 --> 01:12:46,380
 to that rather we're just fanning out in

3160
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:46,380
 

3161
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:49,829
 diverging and building on each other's

3162
01:12:46,370 --> 01:12:49,829
 

3163
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:51,150
 discoveries with no end in mind or the

3164
01:12:49,819 --> 01:12:51,150
 

3165
01:12:49,829 --> 01:12:53,309
 history of art or science or

3166
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:53,309
 

3167
01:12:51,150 --> 01:12:54,520
 architecture etc like all of these

3168
01:12:53,299 --> 01:12:54,520
 

3169
01:12:53,309 --> 01:12:56,710
 things that have these

3170
01:12:54,510 --> 01:12:56,710
 

3171
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:58,810
 these kinds of diversity of divergent

3172
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:58,810
 

3173
01:12:56,710 --> 01:13:00,670
 outputs are open-ended processes that

3174
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,670
 

3175
01:12:58,810 --> 01:13:01,780
 don't end and just keep on building and

3176
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:01,780
 

3177
01:13:00,670 --> 01:13:05,200
 extrapolating from where they've been

3178
01:13:01,770 --> 01:13:05,200
 

3179
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:07,900
 and so you know why don't we create

3180
01:13:05,190 --> 01:13:07,900
 

3181
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:10,330
 these kinds of algorithms why do we only

3182
01:13:07,890 --> 01:13:10,330
 

3183
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:16,420
 try to solve problems why don't we

3184
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:16,420
 

3185
01:13:10,330 --> 01:13:20,110
 create something that can do this and so

3186
01:13:16,410 --> 01:13:20,110
 

3187
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:22,120
 actually there is this there is this one

3188
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:22,120
 

3189
01:13:20,110 --> 01:13:25,120
 community which is which is a very sort

3190
01:13:22,110 --> 01:13:25,120
 

3191
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:26,410
 of small niche community which many have

3192
01:13:25,110 --> 01:13:26,410
 

3193
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:28,180
 probably not heard of which which has

3194
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,180
 

3195
01:13:26,410 --> 01:13:31,960
 been studying at least the open-ended

3196
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:31,960
 

3197
01:13:28,180 --> 01:13:33,640
 evolution aspect and it's called oae and

3198
01:13:31,950 --> 01:13:33,640
 

3199
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:36,040
 there you can see like a graphic from

3200
01:13:33,630 --> 01:13:36,040
 

3201
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:38,200
 one of their meetings there and so it's

3202
01:13:36,030 --> 01:13:38,200
 

3203
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:40,270
 but it's very it's very small and it's

3204
01:13:38,190 --> 01:13:40,270
 

3205
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:42,430
 and it's not mainstream and most people

3206
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:42,430
 

3207
01:13:40,270 --> 01:13:44,770
 don't know about it and it's a shame

3208
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:44,770
 

3209
01:13:42,430 --> 01:13:46,330
 that this is true I think because if you

3210
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:46,330
 

3211
01:13:44,770 --> 01:13:48,100
 think about what open-ended evolution is

3212
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,100
 

3213
01:13:46,330 --> 01:13:50,500
 this is actually the power of creation

3214
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:50,500
 

3215
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:52,300
 literally we're talking about like a

3216
01:13:50,490 --> 01:13:52,300
 

3217
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:54,430
 process that created all of living

3218
01:13:52,290 --> 01:13:54,430
 

3219
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:55,900
 nature and this could be potentially

3220
01:13:54,420 --> 01:13:55,900
 

3221
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:57,610
 transformative if we could harness

3222
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:57,610
 

3223
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:59,380
 processes like this or create algorithms

3224
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,380
 

3225
01:13:57,610 --> 01:14:01,210
 like this that you would never want to

3226
01:13:59,370 --> 01:14:01,210
 

3227
01:13:59,380 --> 01:14:02,530
 turn off because you'd have boundless

3228
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:02,530
 

3229
01:14:01,210 --> 01:14:04,360
 creativity on-demand

3230
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,360
 

3231
01:14:02,530 --> 01:14:06,220
 discoveries beyond the scope of

3232
01:14:04,350 --> 01:14:06,220
 

3233
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:08,230
 optimization because as we've seen

3234
01:14:06,210 --> 01:14:08,230
 

3235
01:14:06,220 --> 01:14:10,420
 through QD and so forth there are

3236
01:14:08,220 --> 01:14:10,420
 

3237
01:14:08,230 --> 01:14:12,190
 deceptive problems like especially the

3238
01:14:10,410 --> 01:14:12,190
 

3239
01:14:10,420 --> 01:14:14,350
 extremely ambitious things like human

3240
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:14,350
 

3241
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:15,850
 level intelligence where probably the

3242
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:15,850
 

3243
01:14:14,350 --> 01:14:17,770
 things the stepping stones you need to

3244
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:17,770
 

3245
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:19,150
 traverse to lead to them don't look like

3246
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,150
 

3247
01:14:17,770 --> 01:14:21,430
 they actually would be the things you'd

3248
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:21,430
 

3249
01:14:19,150 --> 01:14:23,140
 want to optimize to get there and so

3250
01:14:21,420 --> 01:14:23,140
 

3251
01:14:21,430 --> 01:14:26,290
 open-endedness is the kind of thing that

3252
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:26,290
 

3253
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:28,060
 traverses those stepping stones so I

3254
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:28,060
 

3255
01:14:26,290 --> 01:14:29,380
 would say that like to create a process

3256
01:14:28,050 --> 01:14:29,380
 

3257
01:14:28,060 --> 01:14:30,910
 like this is a huge challenge

3258
01:14:29,370 --> 01:14:30,910
 

3259
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:33,130
 algorithmically and it's a grand

3260
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:33,130
 

3261
01:14:30,910 --> 01:14:35,650
 challenge that is on the scale of AI in

3262
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:35,650
 

3263
01:14:33,130 --> 01:14:38,410
 fact it may be the path to AI itself

3264
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:38,410
 

3265
01:14:35,650 --> 01:14:40,870
 because the only example we have of

3266
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:40,870
 

3267
01:14:38,410 --> 01:14:43,510
 creating intelligence at our level is an

3268
01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:43,510
 

3269
01:14:40,870 --> 01:14:45,310
 open-ended process so why does it get so

3270
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:45,310
 

3271
01:14:43,510 --> 01:14:49,270
 little attention then this concept of

3272
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:49,270
 

3273
01:14:45,310 --> 01:14:51,370
 open-endedness well actually one one

3274
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:51,370
 

3275
01:14:49,270 --> 01:14:53,200
 problem like for this field to the

3276
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:53,200
 

3277
01:14:51,370 --> 01:14:55,590
 extent that it's been studied so far is

3278
01:14:53,190 --> 01:14:55,590
 

3279
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:57,700
 that a lot of what we've seen so far in

3280
01:14:55,580 --> 01:14:57,700
 

3281
01:14:55,590 --> 01:14:59,230
 direct research on the open ended

3282
01:14:57,690 --> 01:14:59,230
 

3283
01:14:57,700 --> 01:15:01,060
 processes and it has been in what

3284
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:01,060
 

3285
01:14:59,230 --> 01:15:03,130
 they've been called like a life worlds

3286
01:15:01,050 --> 01:15:03,130
 

3287
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:05,140
 or artificial life worlds which are like

3288
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:05,140
 

3289
01:15:03,130 --> 01:15:07,489
 these little ecological simulations and

3290
01:15:05,130 --> 01:15:07,489
 

3291
01:15:05,140 --> 01:15:09,530
 the problem is that when P

3292
01:15:07,479 --> 01:15:09,530
 

3293
01:15:07,489 --> 01:15:11,060
 see this they usually think of this as

3294
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:11,060
 

3295
01:15:09,530 --> 01:15:12,890
 sort of like a completely different

3296
01:15:11,050 --> 01:15:12,890
 

3297
01:15:11,060 --> 01:15:14,210
 problem than something that we would be

3298
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,210
 

3299
01:15:12,890 --> 01:15:15,710
 interested in machine learning

3300
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:15,710
 

3301
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:17,450
 they're like little simulators maybe

3302
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:17,450
 

3303
01:15:15,710 --> 01:15:19,340
 somebody's using a little toy to learn

3304
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,340
 

3305
01:15:17,450 --> 01:15:21,620
 something about biology maybe something

3306
01:15:19,330 --> 01:15:21,620
 

3307
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:23,270
 about ecology but it's unfortunate

3308
01:15:21,610 --> 01:15:23,270
 

3309
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:25,580
 because actually these are about

3310
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:25,580
 

3311
01:15:23,270 --> 01:15:27,860
 something bigger which is to truly

3312
01:15:25,570 --> 01:15:27,860
 

3313
01:15:25,580 --> 01:15:29,630
 understand what actually bootstraps you

3314
01:15:27,850 --> 01:15:29,630
 

3315
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:31,880
 into a process that just explodes in

3316
01:15:29,620 --> 01:15:31,880
 

3317
01:15:29,630 --> 01:15:32,780
 complexity forever and if you think

3318
01:15:31,870 --> 01:15:32,780
 

3319
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:34,670
 about it like that

3320
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:34,670
 

3321
01:15:32,780 --> 01:15:36,680
 then this is actually like a really deep

3322
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:36,680
 

3323
01:15:34,670 --> 01:15:39,830
 and interesting problem and it's kind of

3324
01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:39,830
 

3325
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:41,270
 unfortunate that we have sort of not

3326
01:15:39,820 --> 01:15:41,270
 

3327
01:15:39,830 --> 01:15:43,280
 appreciated with this with the really

3328
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:43,280
 

3329
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:44,810
 the deeper fundamental insight is that

3330
01:15:43,270 --> 01:15:44,810
 

3331
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:46,160
 we're seeking behind these kinds of

3332
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,160
 

3333
01:15:44,810 --> 01:15:48,770
 things because I think there could have

3334
01:15:46,150 --> 01:15:48,770
 

3335
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:50,090
 been a larger community involved in

3336
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:50,090
 

3337
01:15:48,770 --> 01:15:52,130
 thinking about how to create something

3338
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:52,130
 

3339
01:15:50,090 --> 01:15:54,200
 like this and so really the point is it

3340
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:54,200
 

3341
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:55,430
 doesn't have to be a world I mean you

3342
01:15:54,190 --> 01:15:55,430
 

3343
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:56,660
 look at these worlds and you see it's

3344
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:56,660
 

3345
01:15:55,430 --> 01:15:57,920
 not the kind of work that I do I don't

3346
01:15:56,650 --> 01:15:57,920
 

3347
01:15:56,660 --> 01:15:59,300
 do that kind of work like a little

3348
01:15:57,910 --> 01:15:59,300
 

3349
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:00,590
 creatures running around eating each

3350
01:15:59,290 --> 01:16:00,590
 

3351
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:02,630
 other and eating food and things like

3352
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:02,630
 

3353
01:16:00,590 --> 01:16:04,580
 that but it doesn't have to be a world a

3354
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:04,580
 

3355
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:06,440
 world is just a conduit to understanding

3356
01:16:04,570 --> 01:16:06,440
 

3357
01:16:04,580 --> 01:16:08,300
 it doesn't even have to be a metaphor

3358
01:16:06,430 --> 01:16:08,300
 

3359
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:10,250
 for organisms on earth you know deep

3360
01:16:08,290 --> 01:16:10,250
 

3361
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:12,890
 learning can and should play a role here

3362
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:12,890
 

3363
01:16:10,250 --> 01:16:14,900
 because we can also imagine gradient

3364
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:14,900
 

3365
01:16:12,890 --> 01:16:16,670
 based processes being open-ended with no

3366
01:16:14,890 --> 01:16:16,670
 

3367
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:18,950
 problem at all that makes total sense

3368
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:18,950
 

3369
01:16:16,670 --> 01:16:20,750
 in fact people are open-ended our

3370
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:20,750
 

3371
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:22,370
 lifetimes are open-ended many of us

3372
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:22,370
 

3373
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:23,690
 invent many things in a divergent

3374
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:23,690
 

3375
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:25,880
 process throughout our lifetime and

3376
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:25,880
 

3377
01:16:23,690 --> 01:16:27,739
 collectively we as society and as a

3378
01:16:25,870 --> 01:16:27,739
 

3379
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:30,890
 society and a culture are behaving

3380
01:16:27,729 --> 01:16:30,890
 

3381
01:16:27,739 --> 01:16:33,410
 open-ended Lee so what we're seeking

3382
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:33,410
 

3383
01:16:30,890 --> 01:16:35,180
 then is the fundamental conditions for a

3384
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:35,180
 

3385
01:16:33,410 --> 01:16:37,100
 divergent and creative process that

3386
01:16:35,170 --> 01:16:37,100
 

3387
01:16:35,180 --> 01:16:39,410
 would never end and that could be

3388
01:16:37,090 --> 01:16:39,410
 

3389
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:42,170
 applied to anything so not just some

3390
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:42,170
 

3391
01:16:39,410 --> 01:16:43,940
 kind of ecological world simulation like

3392
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:43,940
 

3393
01:16:42,170 --> 01:16:45,290
 think about like the designs of things

3394
01:16:43,930 --> 01:16:45,290
 

3395
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:48,860
 like buildings vehicles furniture

3396
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:48,860
 

3397
01:16:45,290 --> 01:16:50,870
 clothing equipment etc endless designs

3398
01:16:48,850 --> 01:16:50,870
 

3399
01:16:48,860 --> 01:16:54,170
 repertoires for controllers like

3400
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:54,170
 

3401
01:16:50,870 --> 01:16:55,640
 vehicles and robots and etc generators

3402
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:55,640
 

3403
01:16:54,170 --> 01:16:57,410
 of things like art and music which

3404
01:16:55,630 --> 01:16:57,410
 

3405
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:59,620
 obviously follow open-ended processes

3406
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:59,620
 

3407
01:16:57,410 --> 01:17:01,850
 the history of both of those fields

3408
01:16:59,610 --> 01:17:01,850
 

3409
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:04,610
 imagine worlds that you could create

3410
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:04,610
 

3411
01:17:01,850 --> 01:17:06,380
 that unfold open-ended Lee so they would

3412
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:06,380
 

3413
01:17:04,610 --> 01:17:08,630
 have all the granularity and originality

3414
01:17:06,370 --> 01:17:08,630
 

3415
01:17:06,380 --> 01:17:10,700
 of ecologies on earth I mean these would

3416
01:17:08,620 --> 01:17:10,700
 

3417
01:17:08,630 --> 01:17:12,380
 be amazing places to explore because

3418
01:17:10,690 --> 01:17:12,380
 

3419
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:14,360
 they're actually just as open-ended as

3420
01:17:12,370 --> 01:17:14,360
 

3421
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:16,310
 nature we would have a renewed

3422
01:17:14,350 --> 01:17:16,310
 

3423
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:17,560
 understanding and acceleration of the

3424
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:17,560
 

3425
01:17:16,310 --> 01:17:19,660
 process of human invention

3426
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:19,660
 

3427
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:21,460
 because if we could actually formalize

3428
01:17:19,650 --> 01:17:21,460
 

3429
01:17:19,660 --> 01:17:23,830
 algorithmically how processes that are

3430
01:17:21,450 --> 01:17:23,830
 

3431
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:25,540
 open-ended actually work then we would

3432
01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:25,540
 

3433
01:17:23,830 --> 01:17:26,500
 understand ourselves better as well and

3434
01:17:25,530 --> 01:17:26,500
 

3435
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:28,840
 how to actually implement those

3436
01:17:26,490 --> 01:17:28,840
 

3437
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:32,260
 processes culturally in a more effective

3438
01:17:28,830 --> 01:17:32,260
 

3439
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:33,850
 way you can imagine human coupled

3440
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:33,850
 

3441
01:17:32,260 --> 01:17:35,290
 open-ended systems so of course

3442
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:35,290
 

3443
01:17:33,850 --> 01:17:36,670
 ultimately we're interested in open

3444
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:36,670
 

3445
01:17:35,290 --> 01:17:39,790
 endedness that will produce things that

3446
01:17:36,660 --> 01:17:39,790
 

3447
01:17:36,670 --> 01:17:41,830
 interest us and those kinds of systems

3448
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:41,830
 

3449
01:17:39,790 --> 01:17:45,700
 then would have maybe us in the loop and

3450
01:17:41,820 --> 01:17:45,700
 

3451
01:17:41,830 --> 01:17:48,880
 even maybe intelligence itself could be

3452
01:17:45,690 --> 01:17:48,880
 

3453
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:50,170
 one of the outcomes of open endedness we

3454
01:17:48,870 --> 01:17:50,170
 

3455
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:51,580
 can actually discover perhaps

3456
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:51,580
 

3457
01:17:50,170 --> 01:17:54,040
 intelligence through an open-ended

3458
01:17:51,570 --> 01:17:54,040
 

3459
01:17:51,580 --> 01:17:57,760
 process or maybe we need to have an open

3460
01:17:54,030 --> 01:17:57,760
 

3461
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:59,530
 end process to do that so like I said we

3462
01:17:57,750 --> 01:17:59,530
 

3463
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:01,150
 talked about QD and qts of step in this

3464
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:01,150
 

3465
01:17:59,530 --> 01:18:03,040
 direction because of its divergence but

3466
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:03,040
 

3467
01:18:01,150 --> 01:18:05,560
 QD algorithms won't invent forever

3468
01:18:03,030 --> 01:18:05,560
 

3469
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:07,480
 because we have to ask what would happen

3470
01:18:05,550 --> 01:18:07,480
 

3471
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:09,130
 when the space of the possible is filled

3472
01:18:07,470 --> 01:18:09,130
 

3473
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:11,950
 and there's only so much of a space

3474
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:11,950
 

3475
01:18:09,130 --> 01:18:15,250
 there and any QD algorithm what causes

3476
01:18:11,940 --> 01:18:15,250
 

3477
01:18:11,950 --> 01:18:17,380
 new possibilities to arise and forever

3478
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:17,380
 

3479
01:18:15,250 --> 01:18:20,980
 what would allow that to happen

3480
01:18:17,370 --> 01:18:20,980
 

3481
01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:22,750
 virtually forever and the answer is that

3482
01:18:20,970 --> 01:18:22,750
 

3483
01:18:20,980 --> 01:18:24,760
 a system that's truly open-ended it

3484
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:24,760
 

3485
01:18:22,750 --> 01:18:26,770
 needs to generate new opportunities and

3486
01:18:24,750 --> 01:18:26,770
 

3487
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:28,090
 search through them at the same time in

3488
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:28,090
 

3489
01:18:26,770 --> 01:18:30,340
 other words there's a missing element

3490
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:30,340
 

3491
01:18:28,090 --> 01:18:33,040
 here which is the new opportunities we

3492
01:18:30,330 --> 01:18:33,040
 

3493
01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:35,860
 need new things to do to continually

3494
01:18:33,030 --> 01:18:35,860
 

3495
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:38,830
 have the ability to find new new new

3496
01:18:35,850 --> 01:18:38,830
 

3497
01:18:35,860 --> 01:18:40,900
 solutions to problems and so that's why

3498
01:18:38,820 --> 01:18:40,900
 

3499
01:18:38,830 --> 01:18:43,120
 earth is open-ended in all of its

3500
01:18:40,890 --> 01:18:43,120
 

3501
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:44,980
 contexts from human culture to evolution

3502
01:18:43,110 --> 01:18:44,980
 

3503
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:46,540
 is because opportunities are being

3504
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:46,540
 

3505
01:18:44,980 --> 01:18:48,670
 generated to do something new at the

3506
01:18:46,530 --> 01:18:48,670
 

3507
01:18:46,540 --> 01:18:50,200
 same time as solutions are being

3508
01:18:48,660 --> 01:18:50,200
 

3509
01:18:48,670 --> 01:18:53,290
 searched through those opportunity

3510
01:18:50,190 --> 01:18:53,290
 

3511
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:55,060
 spaces and so as an example because

3512
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:55,060
 

3513
01:18:53,290 --> 01:18:57,280
 trees evolved there was an opportunity

3514
01:18:55,050 --> 01:18:57,280
 

3515
01:18:55,060 --> 01:18:58,930
 to be giraffes and if there hadn't been

3516
01:18:57,270 --> 01:18:58,930
 

3517
01:18:57,280 --> 01:19:00,820
 trees then there wouldn't be an

3518
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:00,820
 

3519
01:18:58,930 --> 01:19:02,410
 opportunity for giraffes and so the

3520
01:19:00,810 --> 01:19:02,410
 

3521
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:04,150
 things that are evolving are creating

3522
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,150
 

3523
01:19:02,410 --> 01:19:06,640
 opportunities for new things to evolve

3524
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:06,640
 

3525
01:19:04,150 --> 01:19:08,800
 and this is a continual process and this

3526
01:19:06,630 --> 01:19:08,800
 

3527
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:10,630
 is a milling missing element currently

3528
01:19:08,790 --> 01:19:10,630
 

3529
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:12,900
 in non open-ended types of algorithmic

3530
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:12,900
 

3531
01:19:10,630 --> 01:19:18,310
 processes so how will we achieve

3532
01:19:12,890 --> 01:19:18,310
 

3533
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:20,230
 open-endedness then in algorithms and of

3534
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:20,230
 

3535
01:19:18,310 --> 01:19:23,620
 course this is a great puzzle but great

3536
01:19:20,220 --> 01:19:23,620
 

3537
01:19:20,230 --> 01:19:25,330
 puzzles can lead to surprises and so we

3538
01:19:23,610 --> 01:19:25,330
 

3539
01:19:23,620 --> 01:19:25,860
 can expect some counterintuitive type of

3540
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:25,860
 

3541
01:19:25,330 --> 01:19:27,750
 insight so

3542
01:19:25,850 --> 01:19:27,750
 

3543
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:29,489
 along this path and I wanted to show you

3544
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:29,489
 

3545
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:30,719
 one example of something that provide

3546
01:19:29,479 --> 01:19:30,719
 

3547
01:19:29,489 --> 01:19:32,550
 some clues because this is actually

3548
01:19:30,709 --> 01:19:32,550
 

3549
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:34,530
 really fun to look at there's very few

3550
01:19:32,540 --> 01:19:34,530
 

3551
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:37,679
 systems I think that exist artificial

3552
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:37,679
 

3553
01:19:34,530 --> 01:19:40,350
 systems that exhibit properties of open

3554
01:19:37,669 --> 01:19:40,350
 

3555
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:44,310
 endedness but this is one that does and

3556
01:19:40,340 --> 01:19:44,310
 

3557
01:19:40,350 --> 01:19:45,989
 it's called pick breeder and and it is

3558
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:45,989
 

3559
01:19:44,310 --> 01:19:49,050
 really interesting because it is it is

3560
01:19:45,979 --> 01:19:49,050
 

3561
01:19:45,989 --> 01:19:51,060
 an artifact which has open endedness

3562
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:51,060
 

3563
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:52,469
 inside of it and we can actually go back

3564
01:19:51,050 --> 01:19:52,469
 

3565
01:19:51,060 --> 01:19:52,980
 and look at the history and see what

3566
01:19:52,459 --> 01:19:52,980
 

3567
01:19:52,469 --> 01:19:54,780
 happened

3568
01:19:52,970 --> 01:19:54,780
 

3569
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:56,489
 but there's a big caveat that I want to

3570
01:19:54,770 --> 01:19:56,489
 

3571
01:19:54,780 --> 01:19:58,020
 admit and concede about it which is that

3572
01:19:56,479 --> 01:19:58,020
 

3573
01:19:56,489 --> 01:20:00,239
 there's a human in the loop which is

3574
01:19:58,010 --> 01:20:00,239
 

3575
01:19:58,020 --> 01:20:01,710
 basically cheating because really what

3576
01:20:00,229 --> 01:20:01,710
 

3577
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:03,750
 we're doing is we're writing on the

3578
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:03,750
 

3579
01:20:01,710 --> 01:20:05,699
 backs of the fact that humans ourselves

3580
01:20:03,740 --> 01:20:05,699
 

3581
01:20:03,750 --> 01:20:07,739
 are open-ended I mean we have the

3582
01:20:05,689 --> 01:20:07,739
 

3583
01:20:05,699 --> 01:20:10,020
 capacity of open endedness already in

3584
01:20:07,729 --> 01:20:10,020
 

3585
01:20:07,739 --> 01:20:11,880
 our intelligence and in our culture and

3586
01:20:10,010 --> 01:20:11,880
 

3587
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:14,340
 so of course we're piggybacking on that

3588
01:20:11,870 --> 01:20:14,340
 

3589
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:15,750
 here and that's important to recognize

3590
01:20:14,330 --> 01:20:15,750
 

3591
01:20:14,340 --> 01:20:17,940
 which means you don't fully understand

3592
01:20:15,740 --> 01:20:17,940
 

3593
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:19,860
 how to implement an autonomous version

3594
01:20:17,930 --> 01:20:19,860
 

3595
01:20:17,940 --> 01:20:21,840
 of such an algorithm however it's still

3596
01:20:19,850 --> 01:20:21,840
 

3597
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:24,510
 very instructive and interesting to see

3598
01:20:21,830 --> 01:20:24,510
 

3599
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:26,850
 it anyway because we don't we rarely see

3600
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:26,850
 

3601
01:20:24,510 --> 01:20:28,230
 artificial open-ended processes so let's

3602
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:28,230
 

3603
01:20:26,850 --> 01:20:29,730
 take a look at this just for a moment

3604
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:29,730
 

3605
01:20:28,230 --> 01:20:32,190
 and see the kind of thing that it does

3606
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:32,190
 

3607
01:20:29,730 --> 01:20:33,330
 so the main idea here is that we're

3608
01:20:32,180 --> 01:20:33,330
 

3609
01:20:32,190 --> 01:20:35,909
 gonna create a system where you just

3610
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:35,909
 

3611
01:20:33,330 --> 01:20:37,650
 breathe pictures but the point is going

3612
01:20:35,899 --> 01:20:37,650
 

3613
01:20:35,909 --> 01:20:39,480
 to be that anyone can follow up from

3614
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:39,480
 

3615
01:20:37,650 --> 01:20:41,610
 anyone else's discoveries so there's no

3616
01:20:39,470 --> 01:20:41,610
 

3617
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:43,889
 unified goal for the system so what do I

3618
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:43,889
 

3619
01:20:41,610 --> 01:20:47,699
 mean by breed pictures I mean here each

3620
01:20:43,879 --> 01:20:47,699
 

3621
01:20:43,889 --> 01:20:50,460
 of these 15 images is generated by a

3622
01:20:47,689 --> 01:20:50,460
 

3623
01:20:47,699 --> 01:20:52,800
 kind of a neural network which is just

3624
01:20:50,450 --> 01:20:52,800
 

3625
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:55,020
 randomized at the start so we have 15

3626
01:20:52,790 --> 01:20:55,020
 

3627
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:57,780
 randomized neural network images this is

3628
01:20:55,010 --> 01:20:57,780
 

3629
01:20:55,020 --> 01:20:59,310
 not again this is just a single neural

3630
01:20:57,770 --> 01:20:59,310
 

3631
01:20:57,780 --> 01:21:01,170
 network that outputs a single image in

3632
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:01,170
 

3633
01:20:59,310 --> 01:21:02,130
 all cases so these aren't unrelated to

3634
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:02,130
 

3635
01:21:01,170 --> 01:21:04,619
 each other they're just different

3636
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:04,619
 

3637
01:21:02,130 --> 01:21:06,960
 networks that are random I pick one and

3638
01:21:04,609 --> 01:21:06,960
 

3639
01:21:04,619 --> 01:21:08,280
 I say okay let's just generate some

3640
01:21:06,950 --> 01:21:08,280
 

3641
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:10,980
 perturbations of the weights of that

3642
01:21:08,270 --> 01:21:10,980
 

3643
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:12,929
 particular image and then we get some

3644
01:21:10,970 --> 01:21:12,929
 

3645
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:14,580
 perturbations and I can pick another and

3646
01:21:12,919 --> 01:21:14,580
 

3647
01:21:12,929 --> 01:21:19,590
 we get some perturbations and so forth

3648
01:21:14,570 --> 01:21:19,590
 

3649
01:21:14,580 --> 01:21:22,790
 and and so the question is if we

3650
01:21:19,580 --> 01:21:22,790
 

3651
01:21:19,590 --> 01:21:26,159
 implement this process in an in a online

3652
01:21:22,780 --> 01:21:26,159
 

3653
01:21:22,790 --> 01:21:27,330
 in an internet-based service so the

3654
01:21:26,149 --> 01:21:27,330
 

3655
01:21:26,159 --> 01:21:29,550
 people can go on the web and do this

3656
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:29,550
 

3657
01:21:27,330 --> 01:21:31,230
 collectively and if I discover something

3658
01:21:29,540 --> 01:21:31,230
 

3659
01:21:29,550 --> 01:21:32,820
 I can publish it and you can branch from

3660
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:32,820
 

3661
01:21:31,230 --> 01:21:34,290
 it and evolve it more they're very

3662
01:21:32,810 --> 01:21:34,290
 

3663
01:21:32,820 --> 01:21:35,710
 simple what kind of things do you think

3664
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:35,710
 

3665
01:21:34,290 --> 01:21:37,660
 you can you can find and I mean what

3666
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:37,660
 

3667
01:21:35,710 --> 01:21:39,100
 the space for a second because it's not

3668
01:21:37,650 --> 01:21:39,100
 

3669
01:21:37,660 --> 01:21:40,870
 it's not too interesting if you look at

3670
01:21:39,090 --> 01:21:40,870
 

3671
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:42,969
 it like this but it gets really

3672
01:21:40,860 --> 01:21:42,969
 

3673
01:21:40,870 --> 01:21:44,710
 interesting if you see what happens when

3674
01:21:42,959 --> 01:21:44,710
 

3675
01:21:42,969 --> 01:21:48,100
 you put all these people into this world

3676
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:48,100
 

3677
01:21:44,710 --> 01:21:51,910
 without any final goal and you get this

3678
01:21:48,090 --> 01:21:51,910
 

3679
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:53,170
 and so this is actually I think this is

3680
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:53,170
 

3681
01:21:51,910 --> 01:21:55,150
 kind of hard to believe when if when you

3682
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:55,150
 

3683
01:21:53,170 --> 01:21:56,770
 first see it that you see these kinds of

3684
01:21:55,140 --> 01:21:56,770
 

3685
01:21:55,150 --> 01:21:58,840
 images because it's coming from like

3686
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:58,840
 

3687
01:21:56,770 --> 01:22:00,550
 these really modest stub beginnings and

3688
01:21:58,830 --> 01:22:00,550
 

3689
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:02,650
 this is really different from the kind

3690
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:02,650
 

3691
01:22:00,550 --> 01:22:04,450
 of stuff we're generally seeing in deep

3692
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:04,450
 

3693
01:22:02,650 --> 01:22:06,489
 learning for example because you have to

3694
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:06,489
 

3695
01:22:04,450 --> 01:22:09,010
 remember these are the outcomes of

3696
01:22:06,479 --> 01:22:09,010
 

3697
01:22:06,489 --> 01:22:11,500
 dozens or maybe at the most hundreds of

3698
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,500
 

3699
01:22:09,010 --> 01:22:13,690
 iterations right we're used to enormous

3700
01:22:11,490 --> 01:22:13,690
 

3701
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:15,160
 amounts of search thousands or millions

3702
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:15,160
 

3703
01:22:13,690 --> 01:22:17,500
 of iterations of search these are

3704
01:22:15,150 --> 01:22:17,500
 

3705
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:19,570
 extremely small peanuts numbers of

3706
01:22:17,490 --> 01:22:19,570
 

3707
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:21,670
 iterations and yet finding these images

3708
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:21,670
 

3709
01:22:19,570 --> 01:22:23,560
 this is not an output of again this is

3710
01:22:21,660 --> 01:22:23,560
 

3711
01:22:21,670 --> 01:22:24,880
 like perturbing something you know forty

3712
01:22:23,550 --> 01:22:24,880
 

3713
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:28,420
 seven times and you get something like

3714
01:22:24,870 --> 01:22:28,420
 

3715
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:29,050
 this something random and so how is this

3716
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:29,050
 

3717
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:31,000
 happening

3718
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:31,000
 

3719
01:22:29,050 --> 01:22:32,590
 well the explanation is that this is

3720
01:22:30,990 --> 01:22:32,590
 

3721
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:35,080
 what happens when you have genuine

3722
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:35,080
 

3723
01:22:32,590 --> 01:22:36,700
 open-ended search the opportunities that

3724
01:22:35,070 --> 01:22:36,700
 

3725
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:38,380
 this that the search is moving through

3726
01:22:36,690 --> 01:22:38,380
 

3727
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:40,000
 that are basically the brains of the

3728
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:40,000
 

3729
01:22:38,380 --> 01:22:42,160
 individuals who are playing the game and

3730
01:22:39,990 --> 01:22:42,160
 

3731
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:44,290
 so different people like different

3732
01:22:42,150 --> 01:22:44,290
 

3733
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:45,820
 things and different people branch off

3734
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:45,820
 

3735
01:22:44,290 --> 01:22:47,950
 from different points depending on what

3736
01:22:45,810 --> 01:22:47,950
 

3737
01:22:45,820 --> 01:22:50,110
 their personal preferences are and so

3738
01:22:47,940 --> 01:22:50,110
 

3739
01:22:47,950 --> 01:22:51,580
 what you get is what looks like this

3740
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:51,580
 

3741
01:22:50,110 --> 01:22:53,440
 which is what a biologist might call a

3742
01:22:51,570 --> 01:22:53,440
 

3743
01:22:51,580 --> 01:22:55,060
 phylogeny and what you're looking at

3744
01:22:53,430 --> 01:22:55,060
 

3745
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:56,620
 here is you're looking at like each one

3746
01:22:55,050 --> 01:22:56,620
 

3747
01:22:55,060 --> 01:22:58,420
 of these connections here is a point

3748
01:22:56,610 --> 01:22:58,420
 

3749
01:22:56,620 --> 01:23:00,550
 where one person branched from another's

3750
01:22:58,410 --> 01:23:00,550
 

3751
01:22:58,420 --> 01:23:02,320
 discovery and so people are branching

3752
01:23:00,540 --> 01:23:02,320
 

3753
01:23:00,550 --> 01:23:04,090
 off of each each other's discoveries in

3754
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:04,090
 

3755
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:05,739
 a divergent way and you're getting this

3756
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,739
 

3757
01:23:04,090 --> 01:23:07,870
 expanding divergent phillup phylogeny

3758
01:23:05,729 --> 01:23:07,870
 

3759
01:23:05,739 --> 01:23:09,460
 and that's what explains why you're

3760
01:23:07,860 --> 01:23:09,460
 

3761
01:23:07,870 --> 01:23:11,020
 getting this kind of a gallery at the

3762
01:23:09,450 --> 01:23:11,020
 

3763
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:13,030
 end and of course these are just a small

3764
01:23:11,010 --> 01:23:13,030
 

3765
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:17,920
 sampling of thousands of images that

3766
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:17,920
 

3767
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:19,750
 have been discovered and so what what we

3768
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:19,750
 

3769
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:21,760
 learned what can we learn looking at

3770
01:23:19,740 --> 01:23:21,760
 

3771
01:23:19,750 --> 01:23:23,080
 what happened in a system like this

3772
01:23:21,750 --> 01:23:23,080
 

3773
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:24,969
 because there's so few artificial

3774
01:23:23,070 --> 01:23:24,969
 

3775
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:26,350
 systems like this and here's something

3776
01:23:24,959 --> 01:23:26,350
 

3777
01:23:24,969 --> 01:23:27,790
 that we discovered which I think is an

3778
01:23:26,340 --> 01:23:27,790
 

3779
01:23:26,350 --> 01:23:29,770
 important insight a fundamental insight

3780
01:23:27,780 --> 01:23:29,770
 

3781
01:23:27,790 --> 01:23:32,110
 about open-endedness in general which is

3782
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:32,110
 

3783
01:23:29,770 --> 01:23:34,600
 that in this system people only found

3784
01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:34,600
 

3785
01:23:32,110 --> 01:23:36,280
 things that they were not seeking as you

3786
01:23:34,590 --> 01:23:36,280
 

3787
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:37,960
 just try to process that for a second

3788
01:23:36,270 --> 01:23:37,960
 

3789
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:39,790
 it's really counterintuitive and kind of

3790
01:23:37,950 --> 01:23:39,790
 

3791
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:41,020
 astonishing like if you look at a system

3792
01:23:39,780 --> 01:23:41,020
 

3793
01:23:39,790 --> 01:23:42,400
 like this and you're looking used to

3794
01:23:41,010 --> 01:23:42,400
 

3795
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:43,540
 thinking about something like gradient

3796
01:23:42,390 --> 01:23:43,540
 

3797
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:45,130
 descent whether you might think about

3798
01:23:43,530 --> 01:23:45,130
 

3799
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:46,840
 well of course we're going to descend

3800
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:46,840
 

3801
01:23:45,130 --> 01:23:49,179
 into the images that are the Optima that

3802
01:23:46,830 --> 01:23:49,179
 

3803
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:51,159
 we're seeking but this is not the case

3804
01:23:49,169 --> 01:23:51,159
 

3805
01:23:49,179 --> 01:23:53,590
 all in the system people only found

3806
01:23:51,149 --> 01:23:53,590
 

3807
01:23:51,159 --> 01:23:54,999
 things they were not looking for and how

3808
01:23:53,580 --> 01:23:54,999
 

3809
01:23:53,590 --> 01:23:56,590
 do I know something like that well I

3810
01:23:54,989 --> 01:23:56,590
 

3811
01:23:54,999 --> 01:23:58,989
 know that because I know everything and

3812
01:23:56,580 --> 01:23:58,989
 

3813
01:23:56,590 --> 01:24:00,639
 we know everything about every single

3814
01:23:58,979 --> 01:24:00,639
 

3815
01:23:58,989 --> 01:24:02,380
 step that was ever taken in the history

3816
01:24:00,629 --> 01:24:02,380
 

3817
01:24:00,639 --> 01:24:04,840
 of this entire system so we can look

3818
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:04,840
 

3819
01:24:02,380 --> 01:24:06,400
 back and see and what we see is when we

3820
01:24:04,830 --> 01:24:06,400
 

3821
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:07,749
 look at the stepping stones which means

3822
01:24:06,390 --> 01:24:07,749
 

3823
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:09,309
 that somebody discovered for example

3824
01:24:07,739 --> 01:24:09,309
 

3825
01:24:07,749 --> 01:24:11,050
 this which looks like an egg with a hat

3826
01:24:09,299 --> 01:24:11,050
 

3827
01:24:09,309 --> 01:24:13,269
 that's what I call it an egg with a hat

3828
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:13,269
 

3829
01:24:11,050 --> 01:24:15,099
 this egg with a hat was branched by

3830
01:24:13,259 --> 01:24:15,099
 

3831
01:24:13,269 --> 01:24:18,130
 someone else to get to what looks like a

3832
01:24:15,089 --> 01:24:18,130
 

3833
01:24:15,099 --> 01:24:20,920
 teapot and it's in the point here is

3834
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:20,920
 

3835
01:24:18,130 --> 01:24:23,170
 it's inconceivable that the person who

3836
01:24:20,910 --> 01:24:23,170
 

3837
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:25,389
 discovered the egg with a hat could

3838
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:25,389
 

3839
01:24:23,170 --> 01:24:27,280
 possibly have been thinking ah just what

3840
01:24:25,379 --> 01:24:27,280
 

3841
01:24:25,389 --> 01:24:29,380
 I need to get a teapot that's

3842
01:24:27,270 --> 01:24:29,380
 

3843
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:31,059
 inconceivable or you can't it or it

3844
01:24:29,370 --> 01:24:31,059
 

3845
01:24:29,380 --> 01:24:32,829
 couldn't be it couldn't possibly be the

3846
01:24:31,049 --> 01:24:32,829
 

3847
01:24:31,059 --> 01:24:34,090
 case that that the person who branched

3848
01:24:32,819 --> 01:24:34,090
 

3849
01:24:32,829 --> 01:24:35,559
 in and got to the teapot was thinking Oh

3850
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:35,559
 

3851
01:24:34,090 --> 01:24:37,510
 finally I needed I needed an egg with a

3852
01:24:35,549 --> 01:24:37,510
 

3853
01:24:35,559 --> 01:24:39,459
 hat or I needed this dish to get to a

3854
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:39,459
 

3855
01:24:37,510 --> 01:24:41,559
 skull or I needed like it looks like a

3856
01:24:39,449 --> 01:24:41,559
 

3857
01:24:39,459 --> 01:24:43,389
 letter G to get to Jupiter in every

3858
01:24:41,549 --> 01:24:43,389
 

3859
01:24:41,559 --> 01:24:44,949
 single case the stepping stone that was

3860
01:24:43,379 --> 01:24:44,949
 

3861
01:24:43,389 --> 01:24:46,630
 necessary to get there could not

3862
01:24:44,939 --> 01:24:46,630
 

3863
01:24:44,949 --> 01:24:49,599
 possibly have been discovered with the

3864
01:24:46,620 --> 01:24:49,599
 

3865
01:24:46,630 --> 01:24:51,999
 final discovery in mind I try to just

3866
01:24:49,589 --> 01:24:51,999
 

3867
01:24:49,599 --> 01:24:53,949
 digest that because not it's both

3868
01:24:51,989 --> 01:24:53,949
 

3869
01:24:51,999 --> 01:24:55,989
 fascinating and concerning in some way

3870
01:24:53,939 --> 01:24:55,989
 

3871
01:24:53,949 --> 01:24:57,670
 you know because we run a lot of our

3872
01:24:55,979 --> 01:24:57,670
 

3873
01:24:55,989 --> 01:24:59,469
 algorithms with the complete opposite

3874
01:24:57,660 --> 01:24:59,469
 

3875
01:24:57,670 --> 01:25:00,909
 spirit that we're trying to find

3876
01:24:59,459 --> 01:25:00,909
 

3877
01:24:59,469 --> 01:25:02,800
 something and that's the way to guide

3878
01:25:00,899 --> 01:25:02,800
 

3879
01:25:00,909 --> 01:25:04,360
 things to get there but this is the

3880
01:25:02,790 --> 01:25:04,360
 

3881
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:06,189
 opposite this is you only get places

3882
01:25:04,350 --> 01:25:06,189
 

3883
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:07,719
 because people are not looking for those

3884
01:25:06,179 --> 01:25:07,719
 

3885
01:25:06,189 --> 01:25:11,139
 particular solutions at some pertinent

3886
01:25:07,709 --> 01:25:11,139
 

3887
01:25:07,719 --> 01:25:13,420
 certain point in time and so it's

3888
01:25:11,129 --> 01:25:13,420
 

3889
01:25:11,139 --> 01:25:15,159
 important sort of like as an insight

3890
01:25:13,410 --> 01:25:15,159
 

3891
01:25:13,420 --> 01:25:16,769
 intern about open-endedness as well

3892
01:25:15,149 --> 01:25:16,769
 

3893
01:25:15,159 --> 01:25:18,630
 because it tells us something about why

3894
01:25:16,759 --> 01:25:18,630
 

3895
01:25:16,769 --> 01:25:21,159
 open-ended systems are so powerful

3896
01:25:18,620 --> 01:25:21,159
 

3897
01:25:18,630 --> 01:25:21,909
 because they're not looking for anything

3898
01:25:21,149 --> 01:25:21,909
 

3899
01:25:21,159 --> 01:25:25,239
 in particular

3900
01:25:21,899 --> 01:25:25,239
 

3901
01:25:21,909 --> 01:25:28,090
 you know the objective of evolution on

3902
01:25:25,229 --> 01:25:28,090
 

3903
01:25:25,239 --> 01:25:30,400
 earth is not to create human brains you

3904
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:30,400
 

3905
01:25:28,090 --> 01:25:32,050
 can't find anything in the description

3906
01:25:30,390 --> 01:25:32,050
 

3907
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:33,820
 of evolution that would predict that

3908
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:33,820
 

3909
01:25:32,050 --> 01:25:36,070
 this is a process designed to produce

3910
01:25:33,810 --> 01:25:36,070
 

3911
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:38,110
 human brains and that is why it produced

3912
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:38,110
 

3913
01:25:36,070 --> 01:25:39,429
 human brains and that is why produced

3914
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:39,429
 

3915
01:25:38,110 --> 01:25:42,280
 flight and that is why produced

3916
01:25:39,419 --> 01:25:42,280
 

3917
01:25:39,429 --> 01:25:44,889
 photosynthesis etc is precisely because

3918
01:25:42,270 --> 01:25:44,889
 

3919
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:47,769
 it's not trying to and it becomes

3920
01:25:44,879 --> 01:25:47,769
 

3921
01:25:44,889 --> 01:25:50,439
 powerful because it is open to

3922
01:25:47,759 --> 01:25:50,439
 

3923
01:25:47,769 --> 01:25:51,849
 discovering everything if you're not

3924
01:25:50,429 --> 01:25:51,849
 

3925
01:25:50,439 --> 01:25:53,320
 open to discovering everything then

3926
01:25:51,839 --> 01:25:53,320
 

3927
01:25:51,849 --> 01:25:55,539
 you're going to discover nothing because

3928
01:25:53,310 --> 01:25:55,539
 

3929
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:57,699
 you'll be deceived and this is why we're

3930
01:25:55,529 --> 01:25:57,699
 

3931
01:25:55,539 --> 01:25:59,650
 seeing this bizarre principle emerge in

3932
01:25:57,689 --> 01:25:59,650
 

3933
01:25:57,699 --> 01:26:01,030
 this complex space is because if you

3934
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:01,030
 

3935
01:25:59,650 --> 01:26:02,980
 look at the stepping stones that lead

3936
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:02,980
 

3937
01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:05,620
 any particular discovery like the skull

3938
01:26:02,970 --> 01:26:05,620
 

3939
01:26:02,980 --> 01:26:07,180
 in this example you will find that if

3940
01:26:05,610 --> 01:26:07,180
 

3941
01:26:05,620 --> 01:26:08,710
 you were looking for that you wouldn't

3942
01:26:07,170 --> 01:26:08,710
 

3943
01:26:07,180 --> 01:26:11,110
 traverse these stepping stones because

3944
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:11,110
 

3945
01:26:08,710 --> 01:26:12,640
 they're deceptive it doesn't look like

3946
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:12,640
 

3947
01:26:11,110 --> 01:26:14,920
 you're removing two skulls if you find a

3948
01:26:12,630 --> 01:26:14,920
 

3949
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:16,750
 donut so you have to be willing to be

3950
01:26:14,910 --> 01:26:16,750
 

3951
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:18,970
 interested in donuts and not skulls in

3952
01:26:16,740 --> 01:26:18,970
 

3953
01:26:16,750 --> 01:26:20,410
 order to get two skulls and this

3954
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:20,410
 

3955
01:26:18,970 --> 01:26:24,310
 actually was one of the inspirations for

3956
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:24,310
 

3957
01:26:20,410 --> 01:26:25,810
 novelty search okay but but then but

3958
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:25,810
 

3959
01:26:24,310 --> 01:26:29,050
 then okay that that's really interesting

3960
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:29,050
 

3961
01:26:25,810 --> 01:26:30,670
 but I remind you that the word there

3962
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:30,670
 

3963
01:26:29,050 --> 01:26:32,350
 weren't any human there were humans

3964
01:26:30,660 --> 01:26:32,350
 

3965
01:26:30,670 --> 01:26:33,730
 involved there and that's cheating right

3966
01:26:32,340 --> 01:26:33,730
 

3967
01:26:32,350 --> 01:26:35,140
 so it'd be interesting to be able to

3968
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:35,140
 

3969
01:26:33,730 --> 01:26:37,510
 create algorithms with this property

3970
01:26:35,130 --> 01:26:37,510
 

3971
01:26:35,140 --> 01:26:39,220
 without humans and so this leads to a

3972
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:39,220
 

3973
01:26:37,510 --> 01:26:40,420
 question that people have asked we're

3974
01:26:39,210 --> 01:26:40,420
 

3975
01:26:39,220 --> 01:26:42,070
 interested in open endedness which is

3976
01:26:40,410 --> 01:26:42,070
 

3977
01:26:40,420 --> 01:26:44,440
 what are the necessary conditions then

3978
01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:44,440
 

3979
01:26:42,070 --> 01:26:46,120
 from a formal perspective if we were

3980
01:26:44,430 --> 01:26:46,120
 

3981
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:48,400
 wanted to write an algorithm like this

3982
01:26:46,110 --> 01:26:48,400
 

3983
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:50,020
 that actually works this way and people

3984
01:26:48,390 --> 01:26:50,020
 

3985
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:51,790
 have hypothesized a whole bunch of

3986
01:26:50,010 --> 01:26:51,790
 

3987
01:26:50,020 --> 01:26:53,650
 necessary conditions for open endedness

3988
01:26:51,780 --> 01:26:53,650
 

3989
01:26:51,790 --> 01:26:56,620
 it goes back to Waddington who was a

3990
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:56,620
 

3991
01:26:53,650 --> 01:26:57,910
 biologist in 1969 Tim Taylor later

3992
01:26:56,610 --> 01:26:57,910
 

3993
01:26:56,620 --> 01:26:59,410
 proposed it proposed a bunch of

3994
01:26:57,900 --> 01:26:59,410
 

3995
01:26:57,910 --> 01:27:02,080
 conditions and there's been other

3996
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:02,080
 

3997
01:26:59,410 --> 01:27:03,940
 attempts to propose conditions to get to

3998
01:27:02,070 --> 01:27:03,940
 

3999
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:05,980
 sort of more a formal algorithmic type

4000
01:27:03,930 --> 01:27:05,980
 

4001
01:27:03,940 --> 01:27:07,810
 of set of requirements for how do you

4002
01:27:05,970 --> 01:27:07,810
 

4003
01:27:05,980 --> 01:27:10,210
 actually create an algorithm that has

4004
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:10,210
 

4005
01:27:07,810 --> 01:27:12,820
 these properties we we made our own

4006
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:12,820
 

4007
01:27:10,210 --> 01:27:15,390
 attempt to myself and Lisa Soros a few

4008
01:27:12,810 --> 01:27:15,390
 

4009
01:27:12,820 --> 01:27:19,270
 years ago to prepare some some

4010
01:27:15,380 --> 01:27:19,270
 

4011
01:27:15,390 --> 01:27:22,510
 conditions and and so the the

4012
01:27:19,260 --> 01:27:22,510
 

4013
01:27:19,270 --> 01:27:25,030
 fundamental goal of this kind of a

4014
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:25,030
 

4015
01:27:22,510 --> 01:27:26,890
 proposal is to describe a system that

4016
01:27:25,020 --> 01:27:26,890
 

4017
01:27:25,030 --> 01:27:28,960
 would generate new challenges and how to

4018
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:28,960
 

4019
01:27:26,890 --> 01:27:31,540
 solve them but we need new things to do

4020
01:27:28,950 --> 01:27:31,540
 

4021
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:32,980
 always and we need to be able to solve

4022
01:27:31,530 --> 01:27:32,980
 

4023
01:27:31,540 --> 01:27:34,390
 them we need to be able to search for

4024
01:27:32,970 --> 01:27:34,390
 

4025
01:27:32,980 --> 01:27:36,730
 new ways to solve them in the spirit of

4026
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:36,730
 

4027
01:27:34,390 --> 01:27:38,800
 something like QD and so this is just

4028
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:38,800
 

4029
01:27:36,730 --> 01:27:40,180
 the this is just for a taste I don't

4030
01:27:38,790 --> 01:27:40,180
 

4031
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:41,950
 want to claim and I certainly don't even

4032
01:27:40,170 --> 01:27:41,950
 

4033
01:27:40,180 --> 01:27:43,630
 believe that this is a definitive set of

4034
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:43,630
 

4035
01:27:41,950 --> 01:27:44,800
 conditions because no one has yet

4036
01:27:43,620 --> 01:27:44,800
 

4037
01:27:43,630 --> 01:27:46,810
 created something that I think is

4038
01:27:44,790 --> 01:27:46,810
 

4039
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:48,940
 satisfyingly reminiscent of nature or

4040
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:48,940
 

4041
01:27:46,810 --> 01:27:50,260
 human innovation but here's an attempt

4042
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:50,260
 

4043
01:27:48,940 --> 01:27:51,400
 just to give you a taste of like what is

4044
01:27:50,250 --> 01:27:51,400
 

4045
01:27:50,260 --> 01:27:53,170
 the thinking like when you're thinking

4046
01:27:51,390 --> 01:27:53,170
 

4047
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:56,620
 about open endedness and algorithms

4048
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:56,620
 

4049
01:27:53,170 --> 01:27:58,570
 without humans in the loop first let's

4050
01:27:56,610 --> 01:27:58,570
 

4051
01:27:56,620 --> 01:28:00,010
 say that there's a there has to be some

4052
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:00,010
 

4053
01:27:58,570 --> 01:28:01,660
 minimal criterion to proliferate in

4054
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,660
 

4055
01:28:00,010 --> 01:28:02,830
 other words if we're going to move in a

4056
01:28:01,650 --> 01:28:02,830
 

4057
01:28:01,660 --> 01:28:05,050
 certain direction which is what I mean

4058
01:28:02,820 --> 01:28:05,050
 

4059
01:28:02,830 --> 01:28:06,250
 by proliferate we need some criterion to

4060
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:06,250
 

4061
01:28:05,050 --> 01:28:07,600
 say yes we're going to continue in that

4062
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:07,600
 

4063
01:28:06,250 --> 01:28:09,660
 direction or else we have to shut it off

4064
01:28:07,590 --> 01:28:09,660
 

4065
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:12,670
 because we can't go in every direction

4066
01:28:09,650 --> 01:28:12,670
 

4067
01:28:09,660 --> 01:28:14,140
 second individuals have to create novel

4068
01:28:12,660 --> 01:28:14,140
 

4069
01:28:12,670 --> 01:28:15,730
 opportunities to satisfy

4070
01:28:14,130 --> 01:28:15,730
 

4071
01:28:14,140 --> 01:28:17,890
 minimal criterion this is where the new

4072
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:17,890
 

4073
01:28:15,730 --> 01:28:20,080
 problems comes from like the trees and

4074
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:20,080
 

4075
01:28:17,890 --> 01:28:21,430
 the giraffes it's the individual things

4076
01:28:20,070 --> 01:28:21,430
 

4077
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:23,140
 that we're evolving or that we're

4078
01:28:21,420 --> 01:28:23,140
 

4079
01:28:21,430 --> 01:28:25,390
 searching for or that we're optimizing

4080
01:28:23,130 --> 01:28:25,390
 

4081
01:28:23,140 --> 01:28:26,980
 inside of this system that need to

4082
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:26,980
 

4083
01:28:25,390 --> 01:28:28,450
 actually create the opportunities to

4084
01:28:26,970 --> 01:28:28,450
 

4085
01:28:26,980 --> 01:28:30,100
 find even more new things do we need to

4086
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:30,100
 

4087
01:28:28,450 --> 01:28:32,560
 have that kind of a dynamic that's in

4088
01:28:30,090 --> 01:28:32,560
 

4089
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:36,070
 effect co-evolutionary or self play like

4090
01:28:32,550 --> 01:28:36,070
 

4091
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:37,450
 so third the individuals in the system

4092
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:37,450
 

4093
01:28:36,070 --> 01:28:39,370
 at some point need to decide for

4094
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:39,370
 

4095
01:28:37,450 --> 01:28:40,660
 themselves with what are whom to

4096
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:40,660
 

4097
01:28:39,370 --> 01:28:42,430
 interact and this is because we can't

4098
01:28:40,650 --> 01:28:42,430
 

4099
01:28:40,660 --> 01:28:44,800
 project millions or billions of years

4100
01:28:42,420 --> 01:28:44,800
 

4101
01:28:42,430 --> 01:28:46,840
 into the future who might be juxtaposed

4102
01:28:44,790 --> 01:28:46,840
 

4103
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:48,040
 with whom like we can't know that the

4104
01:28:46,830 --> 01:28:48,040
 

4105
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:49,690
 drafts will need to interact with the

4106
01:28:48,030 --> 01:28:49,690
 

4107
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:52,060
 trees is to drafts themselves that move

4108
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:52,060
 

4109
01:28:49,690 --> 01:28:53,350
 to the trees and also we need the

4110
01:28:52,050 --> 01:28:53,350
 

4111
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:55,090
 ability to increase the size of

4112
01:28:53,340 --> 01:28:55,090
 

4113
01:28:53,350 --> 01:28:57,010
 representation because since this

4114
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:57,010
 

4115
01:28:55,090 --> 01:28:58,480
 process is supposed to go forever we

4116
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,480
 

4117
01:28:57,010 --> 01:29:00,190
 have no way of anticipating the

4118
01:28:58,470 --> 01:29:00,190
 

4119
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:02,230
 complexity of the final solutions that

4120
01:29:00,180 --> 01:29:02,230
 

4121
01:29:00,190 --> 01:29:03,670
 we might want because there are no final

4122
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:03,670
 

4123
01:29:02,230 --> 01:29:06,190
 solutions it's just going to keep going

4124
01:29:03,660 --> 01:29:06,190
 

4125
01:29:03,670 --> 01:29:07,840
 and so just to point out one thing here

4126
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:07,840
 

4127
01:29:06,190 --> 01:29:09,160
 when we talk about with what or whom to

4128
01:29:07,830 --> 01:29:09,160
 

4129
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:11,770
 interact well that's certainly

4130
01:29:09,150 --> 01:29:11,770
 

4131
01:29:09,160 --> 01:29:16,060
 reminiscent of coevolution in self play

4132
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:16,060
 

4133
01:29:11,770 --> 01:29:17,470
 and this is a long studied topic and I

4134
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:17,470
 

4135
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:19,120
 just wanted to highlight that that

4136
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:19,120
 

4137
01:29:17,470 --> 01:29:20,880
 there's a there's a long history of

4138
01:29:19,110 --> 01:29:20,880
 

4139
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:23,170
 what's called co-evolutionary

4140
01:29:20,870 --> 01:29:23,170
 

4141
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:24,640
 co-evolutionary optimization and there's

4142
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:24,640
 

4143
01:29:23,170 --> 01:29:25,930
 also now recently what's called self

4144
01:29:24,630 --> 01:29:25,930
 

4145
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:28,390
 plane these are very tightly related

4146
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:28,390
 

4147
01:29:25,930 --> 01:29:29,370
 actually save in the same field even

4148
01:29:28,380 --> 01:29:29,370
 

4149
01:29:28,390 --> 01:29:32,110
 though they're going by different names

4150
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:32,110
 

4151
01:29:29,370 --> 01:29:33,130
 and like in coevolution there were

4152
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:33,130
 

4153
01:29:32,110 --> 01:29:35,170
 different kinds like there was

4154
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:35,170
 

4155
01:29:33,130 --> 01:29:37,600
 competitive cooperative and test based a

4156
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:37,600
 

4157
01:29:35,170 --> 01:29:38,980
 lot of it drone game draws on game

4158
01:29:37,590 --> 01:29:38,980
 

4159
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:41,080
 theory like there's what's called Pareto

4160
01:29:38,970 --> 01:29:41,080
 

4161
01:29:38,980 --> 01:29:43,090
 coevolution and then recently we have

4162
01:29:41,070 --> 01:29:43,090
 

4163
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:45,430
 things like self play we have like the

4164
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:45,430
 

4165
01:29:43,090 --> 01:29:48,790
 opening i dodo results alpha go alpha

4166
01:29:45,420 --> 01:29:48,790
 

4167
01:29:45,430 --> 01:29:50,980
 star Starcraft etc all of these kinds of

4168
01:29:48,780 --> 01:29:50,980
 

4169
01:29:48,790 --> 01:29:52,930
 results from self play and so these

4170
01:29:50,970 --> 01:29:52,930
 

4171
01:29:50,980 --> 01:29:55,810
 things would certainly come into our

4172
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:55,810
 

4173
01:29:52,930 --> 01:29:58,000
 understanding of open-ended systems but

4174
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:58,000
 

4175
01:29:55,810 --> 01:29:59,410
 like I said it's not sufficient to just

4176
01:29:57,990 --> 01:29:59,410
 

4177
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,180
 look at those kinds of self play

4178
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:01,180
 

4179
01:29:59,410 --> 01:30:03,880
 scenarios because we also have to figure

4180
01:30:01,170 --> 01:30:03,880
 

4181
01:30:01,180 --> 01:30:05,950
 out a way to create new opportunities so

4182
01:30:03,870 --> 01:30:05,950
 

4183
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:07,510
 if it's all inside of StarCraft then all

4184
01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:07,510
 

4185
01:30:05,950 --> 01:30:09,040
 you'll ever have is Starcraft right

4186
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:09,040
 

4187
01:30:07,510 --> 01:30:11,080
 Starcraft players that get better and

4188
01:30:09,030 --> 01:30:11,080
 

4189
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:12,940
 hopefully over time but we want more

4190
01:30:11,070 --> 01:30:12,940
 

4191
01:30:11,080 --> 01:30:15,070
 than just that in an open-ended system

4192
01:30:12,930 --> 01:30:15,070
 

4193
01:30:12,940 --> 01:30:17,410
 and so if we look if we say we have the

4194
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:17,410
 

4195
01:30:15,070 --> 01:30:19,870
 right conditions and we have something

4196
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:19,870
 

4197
01:30:17,410 --> 01:30:22,210
 coevolution Airi in some sense then we

4198
01:30:19,860 --> 01:30:22,210
 

4199
01:30:19,870 --> 01:30:24,370
 can maybe lead create algorithms that

4200
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:24,370
 

4201
01:30:22,210 --> 01:30:26,489
 exhibit open-ended properties and this

4202
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:26,489
 

4203
01:30:24,370 --> 01:30:28,889
 was one of our earlier first

4204
01:30:26,479 --> 01:30:28,889
 

4205
01:30:26,489 --> 01:30:31,199
 to do this it's called minimal criterion

4206
01:30:28,879 --> 01:30:31,199
 

4207
01:30:28,889 --> 01:30:35,550
 coevolution which tried to abstract

4208
01:30:31,189 --> 01:30:35,550
 

4209
01:30:31,199 --> 01:30:37,110
 these necessary conditions outside of

4210
01:30:35,540 --> 01:30:37,110
 

4211
01:30:35,550 --> 01:30:37,980
 like the a live worlds and sort of to

4212
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:37,980
 

4213
01:30:37,110 --> 01:30:40,170
 say let's make an algorithm that's

4214
01:30:37,970 --> 01:30:40,170
 

4215
01:30:37,980 --> 01:30:41,880
 totally generic and so the idea was

4216
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:41,880
 

4217
01:30:40,170 --> 01:30:43,650
 we'll have a minimal criterion we'll

4218
01:30:41,870 --> 01:30:43,650
 

4219
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:45,300
 have self generating opportunities and

4220
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:45,300
 

4221
01:30:43,650 --> 01:30:46,920
 we'll have this two population kind of

4222
01:30:45,290 --> 01:30:46,920
 

4223
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:48,929
 idea like there'll be one type of thing

4224
01:30:46,910 --> 01:30:48,929
 

4225
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:50,460
 that's Co evolving with another and one

4226
01:30:48,919 --> 01:30:50,460
 

4227
01:30:48,929 --> 01:30:52,349
 thing provides opportunities for the

4228
01:30:50,450 --> 01:30:52,349
 

4229
01:30:50,460 --> 01:30:54,510
 other and so the idea here was let's do

4230
01:30:52,339 --> 01:30:54,510
 

4231
01:30:52,349 --> 01:30:56,610
 mazes and maze solvers for a first test

4232
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:56,610
 

4233
01:30:54,510 --> 01:30:58,619
 so the mazes are Co evolving with the

4234
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:58,619
 

4235
01:30:56,610 --> 01:31:00,119
 main solvers and the mazes can get

4236
01:30:58,609 --> 01:31:00,119
 

4237
01:30:58,619 --> 01:31:02,130
 increasingly complex and the maze

4238
01:31:00,109 --> 01:31:02,130
 

4239
01:31:00,119 --> 01:31:03,869
 solvers which are neural networks have

4240
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:03,869
 

4241
01:31:02,130 --> 01:31:07,289
 to have become increasingly complex to

4242
01:31:03,859 --> 01:31:07,289
 

4243
01:31:03,869 --> 01:31:09,380
 match and we saw in these runs that we

4244
01:31:07,279 --> 01:31:09,380
 

4245
01:31:07,289 --> 01:31:11,639
 could get increasingly complex mazes and

4246
01:31:09,370 --> 01:31:11,639
 

4247
01:31:09,380 --> 01:31:14,099
 increasingly complex solutions to those

4248
01:31:11,629 --> 01:31:14,099
 

4249
01:31:11,639 --> 01:31:16,230
 mazes and it's interesting at least

4250
01:31:14,089 --> 01:31:16,230
 

4251
01:31:14,099 --> 01:31:17,880
 intriguing as an initial hint at what

4252
01:31:16,220 --> 01:31:17,880
 

4253
01:31:16,230 --> 01:31:19,980
 could be accomplished if you consider

4254
01:31:17,870 --> 01:31:19,980
 

4255
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:22,590
 that it might be the case

4256
01:31:19,970 --> 01:31:22,590
 

4257
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:24,329
 maybe assert that if we ran this for a

4258
01:31:22,580 --> 01:31:24,329
 

4259
01:31:22,590 --> 01:31:26,820
 million years or a billion years or say

4260
01:31:24,319 --> 01:31:26,820
 

4261
01:31:24,329 --> 01:31:29,550
 forever theoretically these mazes could

4262
01:31:26,810 --> 01:31:29,550
 

4263
01:31:26,820 --> 01:31:31,050
 become as large as the galaxy and the

4264
01:31:29,540 --> 01:31:31,050
 

4265
01:31:29,550 --> 01:31:33,360
 neural networks to solve them would come

4266
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:33,360
 

4267
01:31:31,050 --> 01:31:35,340
 with them and so there's some taste of

4268
01:31:33,350 --> 01:31:35,340
 

4269
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:37,260
 the increasing complexity aspect of

4270
01:31:35,330 --> 01:31:37,260
 

4271
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:39,719
 open-endedness in an algorithm like this

4272
01:31:37,250 --> 01:31:39,719
 

4273
01:31:37,260 --> 01:31:41,159
 but it's just the beginning and actually

4274
01:31:39,709 --> 01:31:41,159
 

4275
01:31:39,719 --> 01:31:43,769
 were gonna see something even more

4276
01:31:41,149 --> 01:31:43,769
 

4277
01:31:41,159 --> 01:31:45,420
 recent called poet in a moment that Jeff

4278
01:31:43,759 --> 01:31:45,420
 

4279
01:31:43,769 --> 01:31:47,639
 is gonna talk about which is our most

4280
01:31:45,410 --> 01:31:47,639
 

4281
01:31:45,420 --> 01:31:49,349
 recent attempt at open endedness but I

4282
01:31:47,629 --> 01:31:49,349
 

4283
01:31:47,639 --> 01:31:50,940
 just want to close this section on open

4284
01:31:49,339 --> 01:31:50,940
 

4285
01:31:49,349 --> 01:31:53,340
 endedness but just pointing out the

4286
01:31:50,930 --> 01:31:53,340
 

4287
01:31:50,940 --> 01:31:54,989
 field is just beginning many challenges

4288
01:31:53,330 --> 01:31:54,989
 

4289
01:31:53,340 --> 01:31:56,880
 remain we want to be able to generate

4290
01:31:54,979 --> 01:31:56,880
 

4291
01:31:54,989 --> 01:31:58,409
 endless high-quality diverse and

4292
01:31:56,870 --> 01:31:58,409
 

4293
01:31:56,880 --> 01:32:00,480
 interesting artifacts and that's

4294
01:31:58,399 --> 01:32:00,480
 

4295
01:31:58,409 --> 01:32:02,699
 obviously a huge challenge killer

4296
01:32:00,470 --> 01:32:02,699
 

4297
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:04,530
 applications are critical for motivation

4298
01:32:02,689 --> 01:32:04,530
 

4299
01:32:02,699 --> 01:32:06,150
 people want to know why why do you want

4300
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:06,150
 

4301
01:32:04,530 --> 01:32:08,880
 to do this I think we can see some of

4302
01:32:06,140 --> 01:32:08,880
 

4303
01:32:06,150 --> 01:32:10,619
 the inspiration inside of things like QD

4304
01:32:08,870 --> 01:32:10,619
 

4305
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:12,719
 and some of the results that Jeff shared

4306
01:32:10,609 --> 01:32:12,719
 

4307
01:32:10,619 --> 01:32:14,820
 and but we want to be able to show that

4308
01:32:12,709 --> 01:32:14,820
 

4309
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:16,499
 in the context of a more open-ended type

4310
01:32:14,810 --> 01:32:16,499
 

4311
01:32:14,820 --> 01:32:18,210
 of a system why this is very important

4312
01:32:16,489 --> 01:32:18,210
 

4313
01:32:16,499 --> 01:32:19,860
 and I think it is important because

4314
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:19,860
 

4315
01:32:18,210 --> 01:32:22,590
 open-ended this may like I said be a

4316
01:32:19,850 --> 01:32:22,590
 

4317
01:32:19,860 --> 01:32:23,969
 path towards intelligence itself the

4318
01:32:22,580 --> 01:32:23,969
 

4319
01:32:22,590 --> 01:32:25,320
 measurement of success remains

4320
01:32:23,959 --> 01:32:25,320
 

4321
01:32:23,969 --> 01:32:27,090
 controversial so this is just an

4322
01:32:25,310 --> 01:32:27,090
 

4323
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:28,619
 interesting problem in itself is how do

4324
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:28,619
 

4325
01:32:27,090 --> 01:32:30,599
 you measure the open endedness

4326
01:32:28,609 --> 01:32:30,599
 

4327
01:32:28,619 --> 01:32:32,610
 of a system how open-ended is it and

4328
01:32:30,589 --> 01:32:32,610
 

4329
01:32:30,599 --> 01:32:34,769
 there's a lot of argument like within

4330
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:34,769
 

4331
01:32:32,610 --> 01:32:36,929
 the small community so far about how

4332
01:32:34,759 --> 01:32:36,929
 

4333
01:32:34,769 --> 01:32:38,460
 this should be measured this is the

4334
01:32:36,919 --> 01:32:38,460
 

4335
01:32:36,929 --> 01:32:39,310
 power of creation so it can't be

4336
01:32:38,450 --> 01:32:39,310
 

4337
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:41,860
 understated

4338
01:32:39,300 --> 01:32:41,860
 

4339
01:32:39,310 --> 01:32:44,200
 significant this is like all of living

4340
01:32:41,850 --> 01:32:44,200
 

4341
01:32:41,860 --> 01:32:45,340
 nature is a product of a single run to

4342
01:32:44,190 --> 01:32:45,340
 

4343
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:48,910
 have that kind of a power

4344
01:32:45,330 --> 01:32:48,910
 

4345
01:32:45,340 --> 01:32:52,300
 algorithmically is just profound and so

4346
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:52,300
 

4347
01:32:48,910 --> 01:32:54,040
 when will we harness this power I just

4348
01:32:52,290 --> 01:32:54,040
 

4349
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:55,870
 finally want to point out that we have

4350
01:32:54,030 --> 01:32:55,870
 

4351
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:57,670
 sort of created a non-technical intro

4352
01:32:55,860 --> 01:32:57,670
 

4353
01:32:55,870 --> 01:32:59,920
 for those who are interested in open

4354
01:32:57,660 --> 01:32:59,920
 

4355
01:32:57,670 --> 01:33:01,210
 engines want to learn more about it it's

4356
01:32:59,910 --> 01:33:01,210
 

4357
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:02,350
 here at this link

4358
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:02,350
 

4359
01:33:01,210 --> 01:33:04,630
 I think these slides will become

4360
01:33:02,340 --> 01:33:04,630
 

4361
01:33:02,350 --> 01:33:05,920
 available also so if you want to read a

4362
01:33:04,620 --> 01:33:05,920
 

4363
01:33:04,630 --> 01:33:09,840
 little bit more and get some references

4364
01:33:05,910 --> 01:33:09,840
 

4365
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:12,640
 to follow up on and also Joe in my book

4366
01:33:09,830 --> 01:33:12,640
 

4367
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:13,990
 also has a lot of talk about divergent

4368
01:33:12,630 --> 01:33:13,990
 

4369
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:15,700
 search in general if you want to get

4370
01:33:13,980 --> 01:33:15,700
 

4371
01:33:13,990 --> 01:33:16,810
 more in depth into some of the stuff

4372
01:33:15,690 --> 01:33:16,810
 

4373
01:33:15,700 --> 01:33:18,850
 where we couldn't get into the details

4374
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:18,850
 

4375
01:33:16,810 --> 01:33:24,250
 okay thanks so I think Jeff is gonna now

4376
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:24,250
 

4377
01:33:18,850 --> 01:33:25,990
 follow up and show you poet excellent

4378
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:25,990
 

4379
01:33:24,250 --> 01:33:27,910
 thank you Ken yeah this slides will be

4380
01:33:25,980 --> 01:33:27,910
 

4381
01:33:25,990 --> 01:33:29,530
 available and all of the papers that

4382
01:33:27,900 --> 01:33:29,530
 

4383
01:33:27,910 --> 01:33:31,510
 we've talked about today will put in a

4384
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:31,510
 

4385
01:33:29,530 --> 01:33:32,800
 giant appendix at the end of citations

4386
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:32,800
 

4387
01:33:31,510 --> 01:33:35,640
 so if you're interested in tracking any

4388
01:33:32,790 --> 01:33:35,640
 

4389
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:37,990
 of them down they will be in the slides

4390
01:33:35,630 --> 01:33:37,990
 

4391
01:33:35,640 --> 01:33:41,400
 so I think that you're getting the sense

4392
01:33:37,980 --> 01:33:41,400
 

4393
01:33:37,990 --> 01:33:44,530
 that we are really really excited about

4394
01:33:41,390 --> 01:33:44,530
 

4395
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:46,840
 open ended algorithms and trying to

4396
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:46,840
 

4397
01:33:44,530 --> 01:33:48,730
 create algorithms that generate their

4398
01:33:46,830 --> 01:33:48,730
 

4399
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:50,890
 own problems and solutions to those

4400
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:50,890
 

4401
01:33:48,730 --> 01:33:54,070
 problems because we think that that is a

4402
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:54,070
 

4403
01:33:50,890 --> 01:33:55,870
 key to making progress and so what I

4404
01:33:54,060 --> 01:33:55,870
 

4405
01:33:54,070 --> 01:33:58,870
 want to show you now is kind of our

4406
01:33:55,860 --> 01:33:58,870
 

4407
01:33:55,870 --> 01:34:00,100
 latest salvo in this direction the most

4408
01:33:58,860 --> 01:34:00,100
 

4409
01:33:58,870 --> 01:34:01,900
 recent thing that we've done to really

4410
01:34:00,090 --> 01:34:01,900
 

4411
01:34:00,100 --> 01:34:03,010
 try to push on this front and it's

4412
01:34:01,890 --> 01:34:03,010
 

4413
01:34:01,900 --> 01:34:04,360
 definitely not the final algorithm

4414
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:04,360
 

4415
01:34:03,010 --> 01:34:05,890
 there's lots and lots of research should

4416
01:34:04,350 --> 01:34:05,890
 

4417
01:34:04,360 --> 01:34:08,350
 be done but we're really really excited

4418
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:08,350
 

4419
01:34:05,890 --> 01:34:11,230
 about this and so it comes from the idea

4420
01:34:08,340 --> 01:34:11,230
 

4421
01:34:08,350 --> 01:34:12,580
 that designing in reinforcement learning

4422
01:34:11,220 --> 01:34:12,580
 

4423
01:34:11,230 --> 01:34:14,320
 and machine learning in general we know

4424
01:34:12,570 --> 01:34:14,320
 

4425
01:34:12,580 --> 01:34:16,090
 that like data is the rocket fuel of

4426
01:34:14,310 --> 01:34:16,090
 

4427
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:17,590
 success if you want to achieve something

4428
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:17,590
 

4429
01:34:16,090 --> 01:34:19,390
 really ambitious you have to have the

4430
01:34:17,580 --> 01:34:19,390
 

4431
01:34:17,590 --> 01:34:21,400
 right data or the right training

4432
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:21,400
 

4433
01:34:19,390 --> 01:34:23,590
 environments so then we started asking

4434
01:34:21,390 --> 01:34:23,590
 

4435
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:25,060
 ourselves if that is so critical then

4436
01:34:23,580 --> 01:34:25,060
 

4437
01:34:23,590 --> 01:34:26,920
 can we just have algorithms that

4438
01:34:25,050 --> 01:34:26,920
 

4439
01:34:25,060 --> 01:34:28,660
 generate their own data or generate

4440
01:34:26,910 --> 01:34:28,660
 

4441
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:31,330
 their own training environments as they

4442
01:34:28,650 --> 01:34:31,330
 

4443
01:34:28,660 --> 01:34:32,470
 go and we think that that's a

4444
01:34:31,320 --> 01:34:32,470
 

4445
01:34:31,330 --> 01:34:34,150
 fascinating question and we think that

4446
01:34:32,460 --> 01:34:34,150
 

4447
01:34:32,470 --> 01:34:36,130
 it's actually essential to get any we're

4448
01:34:34,140 --> 01:34:36,130
 

4449
01:34:34,150 --> 01:34:38,830
 really really ambitious as can just

4450
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:38,830
 

4451
01:34:36,130 --> 01:34:41,170
 describe so our most recent algorithm

4452
01:34:38,820 --> 01:34:41,170
 

4453
01:34:38,830 --> 01:34:43,240
 here is this poet algorithm it stands

4454
01:34:41,160 --> 01:34:43,240
 

4455
01:34:41,170 --> 01:34:46,300
 for the paired open-ended trailblazer

4456
01:34:43,230 --> 01:34:46,300
 

4457
01:34:43,240 --> 01:34:47,590
 and there is a pair of things happening

4458
01:34:46,290 --> 01:34:47,590
 

4459
01:34:46,300 --> 01:34:50,219
 there's going to be an algorithm that's

4460
01:34:47,580 --> 01:34:50,219
 

4461
01:34:47,590 --> 01:34:52,140
 generating problems or challenges or

4462
01:34:50,209 --> 01:34:52,140
 

4463
01:34:50,219 --> 01:34:54,480
 and then there's going to be a separate

4464
01:34:52,130 --> 01:34:54,480
 

4465
01:34:52,140 --> 01:34:56,370
 group of things that are being optimized

4466
01:34:54,470 --> 01:34:56,370
 

4467
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:59,400
 to try to solve each of those challenges

4468
01:34:56,360 --> 01:34:59,400
 

4469
01:34:56,370 --> 01:35:00,270
 as they get introduced now Ken just

4470
01:34:59,390 --> 01:35:00,270
 

4471
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:01,949
 showed you the minimum criteria

4472
01:35:00,260 --> 01:35:01,949
 

4473
01:35:00,270 --> 01:35:03,420
 co-evolution work which is really cool

4474
01:35:01,939 --> 01:35:03,420
 

4475
01:35:01,949 --> 01:35:05,239
 because it was the first time that I had

4476
01:35:03,410 --> 01:35:05,239
 

4477
01:35:03,420 --> 01:35:07,770
 really realized that you could

4478
01:35:05,229 --> 01:35:07,770
 

4479
01:35:05,239 --> 01:35:09,480
 parameterize the training environment

4480
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:09,480
 

4481
01:35:07,770 --> 01:35:11,250
 itself and just describe it and then you

4482
01:35:09,470 --> 01:35:11,250
 

4483
01:35:09,480 --> 01:35:12,630
 could separately optimize and play in

4484
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:12,630
 

4485
01:35:11,250 --> 01:35:15,030
 this space of what does it mean to be

4486
01:35:12,620 --> 01:35:15,030
 

4487
01:35:12,630 --> 01:35:16,410
 the right training environment this

4488
01:35:15,020 --> 01:35:16,410
 

4489
01:35:15,030 --> 01:35:17,850
 algorithm takes it a little bit further

4490
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:17,850
 

4491
01:35:16,410 --> 01:35:19,350
 though because what we wanted to add

4492
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:19,350
 

4493
01:35:17,850 --> 01:35:20,730
 back in were some of the things that we

4494
01:35:19,340 --> 01:35:20,730
 

4495
01:35:19,350 --> 01:35:22,739
 think are really essential one of them

4496
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:22,739
 

4497
01:35:20,730 --> 01:35:24,360
 is that you continuously optimize within

4498
01:35:22,729 --> 01:35:24,360
 

4499
01:35:22,739 --> 01:35:25,620
 a problem so you don't just meet the

4500
01:35:24,350 --> 01:35:25,620
 

4501
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:26,670
 minimum bar but you get better and

4502
01:35:25,610 --> 01:35:26,670
 

4503
01:35:25,620 --> 01:35:28,260
 better and better at it over time

4504
01:35:26,660 --> 01:35:28,260
 

4505
01:35:26,670 --> 01:35:30,660
 because that may be a stepping stone to

4506
01:35:28,250 --> 01:35:30,660
 

4507
01:35:28,260 --> 01:35:32,969
 solving some other problem and we also

4508
01:35:30,650 --> 01:35:32,969
 

4509
01:35:30,660 --> 01:35:34,080
 wanted to harness that idea of goal

4510
01:35:32,959 --> 01:35:34,080
 

4511
01:35:32,969 --> 01:35:35,640
 switching that I spent so much time

4512
01:35:34,070 --> 01:35:35,640
 

4513
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:37,680
 talking about there you want to be able

4514
01:35:35,630 --> 01:35:37,680
 

4515
01:35:35,640 --> 01:35:39,180
 to be going really well on one problem

4516
01:35:37,670 --> 01:35:39,180
 

4517
01:35:37,680 --> 01:35:41,190
 but if you happened along the way to

4518
01:35:39,170 --> 01:35:41,190
 

4519
01:35:39,180 --> 01:35:42,719
 produce something that's really good on

4520
01:35:41,180 --> 01:35:42,719
 

4521
01:35:41,190 --> 01:35:44,580
 another type of problem or you should

4522
01:35:42,709 --> 01:35:44,580
 

4523
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:47,010
 capture that and let the algorithm take

4524
01:35:44,570 --> 01:35:47,010
 

4525
01:35:44,580 --> 01:35:49,170
 advantage of that so here's a little

4526
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,170
 

4527
01:35:47,010 --> 01:35:51,600
 video that describes hopefully this is

4528
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:51,600
 

4529
01:35:49,170 --> 01:35:52,770
 gonna play this career that it describes

4530
01:35:51,590 --> 01:35:52,770
 

4531
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:54,390
 the algorithm I think it does a really

4532
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:54,390
 

4533
01:35:52,770 --> 01:35:56,330
 good job of summarizing it so it kind of

4534
01:35:54,380 --> 01:35:56,330
 

4535
01:35:54,390 --> 01:35:59,610
 is a bit jug drinking from a firehose

4536
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:59,610
 

4537
01:35:56,330 --> 01:36:02,070
 but hopefully we'll just let it run and

4538
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:02,070
 

4539
01:35:59,610 --> 01:36:03,630
 so you see this little agent here this

4540
01:36:02,060 --> 01:36:03,630
 

4541
01:36:02,070 --> 01:36:05,640
 is the world we're operating in this is

4542
01:36:03,620 --> 01:36:05,640
 

4543
01:36:03,630 --> 01:36:08,190
 just the first world that we play play

4544
01:36:05,630 --> 01:36:08,190
 

4545
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:09,750
 in but we parameterize that environment

4546
01:36:08,180 --> 01:36:09,750
 

4547
01:36:08,190 --> 01:36:11,520
 that could those kind of obstacle

4548
01:36:09,740 --> 01:36:11,520
 

4549
01:36:09,750 --> 01:36:13,350
 courses and we allow optimization to

4550
01:36:11,510 --> 01:36:13,350
 

4551
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:16,320
 both create different environmental

4552
01:36:13,340 --> 01:36:16,320
 

4553
01:36:13,350 --> 01:36:18,180
 challenges and try to invite optimize a

4554
01:36:16,310 --> 01:36:18,180
 

4555
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:20,280
 neural network with deep reinforcement

4556
01:36:18,170 --> 01:36:20,280
 

4557
01:36:18,180 --> 01:36:21,960
 learning to solve those challenges and

4558
01:36:20,270 --> 01:36:21,960
 

4559
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:24,210
 all of these different challenges that

4560
01:36:21,950 --> 01:36:24,210
 

4561
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:26,940
 you're seeing here were invented by the

4562
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:26,940
 

4563
01:36:24,210 --> 01:36:28,739
 algorithm as it's running and also the

4564
01:36:26,930 --> 01:36:28,739
 

4565
01:36:26,940 --> 01:36:31,290
 agent that is solving that problem was

4566
01:36:28,729 --> 01:36:31,290
 

4567
01:36:28,739 --> 01:36:32,910
 also invented at the same time and over

4568
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:32,910
 

4569
01:36:31,290 --> 01:36:34,230
 time these environments get more and

4570
01:36:32,900 --> 01:36:34,230
 

4571
01:36:32,910 --> 01:36:36,630
 more complicated like that's actually a

4572
01:36:34,220 --> 01:36:36,630
 

4573
01:36:34,230 --> 01:36:38,250
 really really big gap for this agent to

4574
01:36:36,620 --> 01:36:38,250
 

4575
01:36:36,630 --> 01:36:40,350
 try to solve and those are really big

4576
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:40,350
 

4577
01:36:38,250 --> 01:36:43,800
 stumps for this little guy to try to

4578
01:36:40,340 --> 01:36:43,800
 

4579
01:36:40,350 --> 01:36:46,230
 crawl over and what we find is that this

4580
01:36:43,790 --> 01:36:46,230
 

4581
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:48,330
 system just kind of loves to innovate

4582
01:36:46,220 --> 01:36:48,330
 

4583
01:36:46,230 --> 01:36:49,949
 and push its own limits and invent new

4584
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:49,949
 

4585
01:36:48,330 --> 01:36:51,930
 challenges that are right at the limit

4586
01:36:49,939 --> 01:36:51,930
 

4587
01:36:49,949 --> 01:36:54,030
 of what it's capable of doing and then

4588
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:54,030
 

4589
01:36:51,930 --> 01:36:55,949
 building off of those skills is learning

4590
01:36:54,020 --> 01:36:55,949
 

4591
01:36:54,030 --> 01:36:57,570
 to child go and challenge and take on

4592
01:36:55,939 --> 01:36:57,570
 

4593
01:36:55,949 --> 01:36:59,820
 even harder environments like these ones

4594
01:36:57,560 --> 01:36:59,820
 

4595
01:36:57,570 --> 01:37:02,250
 here this little creature here has

4596
01:36:59,810 --> 01:37:02,250
 

4597
01:36:59,820 --> 01:37:04,260
 little lidar sensors and what you'll see

4598
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:04,260
 

4599
01:37:02,250 --> 01:37:06,000
 is that in some of these videos it kind

4600
01:37:04,250 --> 01:37:06,000
 

4601
01:37:04,260 --> 01:37:08,070
 of like like literally like runs up and

4602
01:37:05,990 --> 01:37:08,070
 

4603
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:10,440
 then like leaps over a chasm which is

4604
01:37:08,060 --> 01:37:10,440
 

4605
01:37:08,070 --> 01:37:12,510
 quite interesting and impressive to see

4606
01:37:10,430 --> 01:37:12,510
 

4607
01:37:10,440 --> 01:37:14,310
 these amazing skills sometimes the

4608
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:14,310
 

4609
01:37:12,510 --> 01:37:15,630
 chasms are basically right at the limit

4610
01:37:14,300 --> 01:37:15,630
 

4611
01:37:14,310 --> 01:37:18,300
 of what's even possible given its

4612
01:37:15,620 --> 01:37:18,300
 

4613
01:37:15,630 --> 01:37:19,710
 morphology one of the things that we're

4614
01:37:18,290 --> 01:37:19,710
 

4615
01:37:18,300 --> 01:37:21,420
 interested in the future is even you

4616
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:21,420
 

4617
01:37:19,710 --> 01:37:22,830
 know simultaneously optimizing the

4618
01:37:21,410 --> 01:37:22,830
 

4619
01:37:21,420 --> 01:37:24,180
 bodies of these robots because you could

4620
01:37:22,820 --> 01:37:24,180
 

4621
01:37:22,830 --> 01:37:28,500
 imagine that like you maybe you need

4622
01:37:24,170 --> 01:37:28,500
 

4623
01:37:24,180 --> 01:37:30,210
 longer legs to go over them so I will

4624
01:37:28,490 --> 01:37:30,210
 

4625
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:32,010
 one of the final things I'll mention

4626
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:32,010
 

4627
01:37:30,210 --> 01:37:33,840
 here is that any of these really

4628
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,840
 

4629
01:37:32,010 --> 01:37:35,550
 challenging problems when you go to go

4630
01:37:33,830 --> 01:37:35,550
 

4631
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:37,620
 back and look at it you cannot directly

4632
01:37:35,540 --> 01:37:37,620
 

4633
01:37:35,550 --> 01:37:41,820
 optimize to solve that problem if you

4634
01:37:37,610 --> 01:37:41,820
 

4635
01:37:37,620 --> 01:37:43,470
 try to do that either by just dropping

4636
01:37:41,810 --> 01:37:43,470
 

4637
01:37:41,820 --> 01:37:44,820
 an agent in that environment and trying

4638
01:37:43,460 --> 01:37:44,820
 

4639
01:37:43,470 --> 01:37:46,410
 to solve it because there's no curricula

4640
01:37:44,810 --> 01:37:46,410
 

4641
01:37:44,820 --> 01:37:48,990
 to get there or by taking kind of like

4642
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:48,990
 

4643
01:37:46,410 --> 01:37:50,280
 what you see is the direct path here are

4644
01:37:48,980 --> 01:37:50,280
 

4645
01:37:48,990 --> 01:37:52,350
 some solutions that traditional

4646
01:37:50,270 --> 01:37:52,350
 

4647
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:54,210
 optimization cannot solve but poet does

4648
01:37:52,340 --> 01:37:54,210
 

4649
01:37:52,350 --> 01:37:59,190
 find a solution to some of these really

4650
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:59,190
 

4651
01:37:54,210 --> 01:38:00,660
 really crazy environments so um just so

4652
01:37:59,180 --> 01:38:00,660
 

4653
01:37:59,190 --> 01:38:02,490
 I want to quickly kind of show you how

4654
01:38:00,650 --> 01:38:02,490
 

4655
01:38:00,660 --> 01:38:04,680
 this algorithm works so we start off

4656
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:04,680
 

4657
01:38:02,490 --> 01:38:06,420
 with a parameter vector that describes

4658
01:38:04,670 --> 01:38:06,420
 

4659
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:08,490
 an environment for example how rugged it

4660
01:38:06,410 --> 01:38:08,490
 

4661
01:38:06,420 --> 01:38:10,860
 is how wide the gaps how hard tall the

4662
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:10,860
 

4663
01:38:08,490 --> 01:38:12,870
 stumps are and that I'm showing here is

4664
01:38:10,850 --> 01:38:12,870
 

4665
01:38:10,860 --> 01:38:14,910
 Phi 1 for environment 1 and it's pretty

4666
01:38:12,860 --> 01:38:14,910
 

4667
01:38:12,870 --> 01:38:16,320
 easy because we start easy and then what

4668
01:38:14,900 --> 01:38:16,320
 

4669
01:38:14,910 --> 01:38:18,180
 we'll do is we'll launch an optimization

4670
01:38:16,310 --> 01:38:18,180
 

4671
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:19,710
 algorithm for theta 1 which is trying to

4672
01:38:18,170 --> 01:38:19,710
 

4673
01:38:18,180 --> 01:38:21,180
 solve that problem and we run it until

4674
01:38:19,700 --> 01:38:21,180
 

4675
01:38:19,710 --> 01:38:23,580
 it gets to a certain threshold of

4676
01:38:21,170 --> 01:38:23,580
 

4677
01:38:21,180 --> 01:38:26,190
 performance and once it's kind of okay

4678
01:38:23,570 --> 01:38:26,190
 

4679
01:38:23,580 --> 01:38:28,200
 once it's decent on that then we create

4680
01:38:26,180 --> 01:38:28,200
 

4681
01:38:26,190 --> 01:38:30,090
 a new problem Phi 2 which is maybe a

4682
01:38:28,190 --> 01:38:30,090
 

4683
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:32,280
 somewhat medium difficulty and we'll

4684
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:32,280
 

4685
01:38:30,090 --> 01:38:33,900
 transfer the previous agent into that

4686
01:38:32,270 --> 01:38:33,900
 

4687
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:35,490
 environment to try to start optimizing

4688
01:38:33,890 --> 01:38:35,490
 

4689
01:38:33,900 --> 01:38:37,290
 on that new problem because that's a

4690
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:37,290
 

4691
01:38:35,490 --> 01:38:39,000
 good launching off point and then we'll

4692
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:39,000
 

4693
01:38:37,290 --> 01:38:40,380
 try to generate a new environment and we

4694
01:38:38,990 --> 01:38:40,380
 

4695
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:42,090
 have this criteria which is if the

4696
01:38:40,370 --> 01:38:42,090
 

4697
01:38:40,380 --> 01:38:44,310
 environment is too hard or too easy for

4698
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:44,310
 

4699
01:38:42,090 --> 01:38:46,110
 the current population of agents then we

4700
01:38:44,300 --> 01:38:46,110
 

4701
01:38:44,310 --> 01:38:48,750
 throw it out we say that was that's no

4702
01:38:46,100 --> 01:38:48,750
 

4703
01:38:46,110 --> 01:38:51,480
 good so we'll try again will now create

4704
01:38:48,740 --> 01:38:51,480
 

4705
01:38:48,750 --> 01:38:53,640
 5 3 which is not too hard or too too

4706
01:38:51,470 --> 01:38:53,640
 

4707
01:38:51,480 --> 01:38:55,110
 easy and we'll transfer an agent in for

4708
01:38:53,630 --> 01:38:55,110
 

4709
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:56,790
 example that one there and we'll kind of

4710
01:38:55,100 --> 01:38:56,790
 

4711
01:38:55,110 --> 01:38:58,260
 go along in this path now no this is not

4712
01:38:56,780 --> 01:38:58,260
 

4713
01:38:56,790 --> 01:38:59,910
 a linear chain at any point we might

4714
01:38:58,250 --> 01:38:59,910
 

4715
01:38:58,260 --> 01:39:02,100
 branch off of any one of these current

4716
01:38:59,900 --> 01:39:02,100
 

4717
01:38:59,910 --> 01:39:04,230
 challenges with a new problem and the

4718
01:39:02,090 --> 01:39:04,230
 

4719
01:39:02,100 --> 01:39:06,540
 question is for example 4 5 4 here which

4720
01:39:04,220 --> 01:39:06,540
 

4721
01:39:04,230 --> 01:39:08,520
 input agent should we transfer in well

4722
01:39:06,530 --> 01:39:08,520
 

4723
01:39:06,540 --> 01:39:10,470
 in reality we try them all and so it

4724
01:39:08,510 --> 01:39:10,470
 

4725
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:12,330
 happens to be that phi theta 2 here is

4726
01:39:10,460 --> 01:39:12,330
 

4727
01:39:10,470 --> 01:39:14,430
 the best parameter vector just to launch

4728
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:14,430
 

4729
01:39:12,330 --> 01:39:15,440
 optimization off and so that transfers

4730
01:39:14,420 --> 01:39:15,440
 

4731
01:39:14,430 --> 01:39:17,239
 in here and the

4732
01:39:15,430 --> 01:39:17,239
 

4733
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:19,340
 this continues to increasingly generate

4734
01:39:17,229 --> 01:39:19,340
 

4735
01:39:17,239 --> 01:39:21,380
 harder and harder environments until you

4736
01:39:19,330 --> 01:39:21,380
 

4737
01:39:19,340 --> 01:39:22,730
 get to something very hard now remember

4738
01:39:21,370 --> 01:39:22,730
 

4739
01:39:21,380 --> 01:39:24,949
 I keep talking about these algorithms

4740
01:39:22,720 --> 01:39:24,949
 

4741
01:39:22,730 --> 01:39:26,840
 learn their own curricula via kind of

4742
01:39:24,939 --> 01:39:26,840
 

4743
01:39:24,949 --> 01:39:29,120
 bet hedging well think about this this

4744
01:39:26,830 --> 01:39:29,120
 

4745
01:39:26,840 --> 01:39:30,949
 5/6 here maybe originally we have a

4746
01:39:29,110 --> 01:39:30,949
 

4747
01:39:29,120 --> 01:39:32,870
 parameter vector that's okay on it but

4748
01:39:30,939 --> 01:39:32,870
 

4749
01:39:30,949 --> 01:39:34,580
 that may not be the best stepping-stone

4750
01:39:32,860 --> 01:39:34,580
 

4751
01:39:32,870 --> 01:39:36,410
 to solve that challenge so what

4752
01:39:34,570 --> 01:39:36,410
 

4753
01:39:34,580 --> 01:39:37,730
 ultimately can happen endogenously

4754
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:37,730
 

4755
01:39:36,410 --> 01:39:40,550
 within this algorithm is that maybe

4756
01:39:37,720 --> 01:39:40,550
 

4757
01:39:37,730 --> 01:39:42,770
 theta 4 here happens to get better and

4758
01:39:40,540 --> 01:39:42,770
 

4759
01:39:40,550 --> 01:39:44,360
 actually comes in and replaces theta 3

4760
01:39:42,760 --> 01:39:44,360
 

4761
01:39:42,770 --> 01:39:46,040
 and that challenge and then ultimately

4762
01:39:44,350 --> 01:39:46,040
 

4763
01:39:44,360 --> 01:39:48,380
 that becomes the thing that finally

4764
01:39:46,030 --> 01:39:48,380
 

4765
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:51,110
 solves this theta 6 at a really really

4766
01:39:48,370 --> 01:39:51,110
 

4767
01:39:48,380 --> 01:39:52,460
 high level and so you have all of the

4768
01:39:51,100 --> 01:39:52,460
 

4769
01:39:51,110 --> 01:39:53,690
 properties of goal switching and

4770
01:39:52,450 --> 01:39:53,690
 

4771
01:39:52,460 --> 01:39:55,130
 curricula learning that I said earlier

4772
01:39:53,680 --> 01:39:55,130
 

4773
01:39:53,690 --> 01:39:57,050
 and as I mentioned if you try to

4774
01:39:55,120 --> 01:39:57,050
 

4775
01:39:55,130 --> 01:39:59,449
 directly solve these hard challenges it

4776
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:59,449
 

4777
01:39:57,050 --> 01:40:01,790
 doesn't work with hand-coded curricula

4778
01:39:59,439 --> 01:40:01,790
 

4779
01:39:59,449 --> 01:40:03,739
 or just direct optimization so I'm going

4780
01:40:01,780 --> 01:40:03,739
 

4781
01:40:01,790 --> 01:40:05,480
 to show you one quick anecdote that I

4782
01:40:03,729 --> 01:40:05,480
 

4783
01:40:03,739 --> 01:40:06,949
 think is really beautiful and capsulate

4784
01:40:05,470 --> 01:40:06,949
 

4785
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:07,730
 captures a lot of the spirit of

4786
01:40:06,939 --> 01:40:07,730
 

4787
01:40:06,949 --> 01:40:09,620
 everything we've been talking about

4788
01:40:07,720 --> 01:40:09,620
 

4789
01:40:07,730 --> 01:40:11,750
 today so this actually happened within

4790
01:40:09,610 --> 01:40:11,750
 

4791
01:40:09,620 --> 01:40:13,880
 one of our runs this is the original

4792
01:40:11,740 --> 01:40:13,880
 

4793
01:40:11,750 --> 01:40:16,370
 simple environment a creature here is

4794
01:40:13,870 --> 01:40:16,370
 

4795
01:40:13,880 --> 01:40:18,410
 running and it scores 298 and then

4796
01:40:16,360 --> 01:40:18,410
 

4797
01:40:16,370 --> 01:40:20,330
 because that's a decent score we we we

4798
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:20,330
 

4799
01:40:18,410 --> 01:40:21,199
 copy that environment change a little

4800
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:21,199
 

4801
01:40:20,330 --> 01:40:23,180
 bit and now there are these little

4802
01:40:21,189 --> 01:40:23,180
 

4803
01:40:21,199 --> 01:40:24,860
 stumps in the environment we transfer

4804
01:40:23,170 --> 01:40:24,860
 

4805
01:40:23,180 --> 01:40:28,040
 that original agent in to this

4806
01:40:24,850 --> 01:40:28,040
 

4807
01:40:24,860 --> 01:40:29,510
 environment here and it starts not

4808
01:40:28,030 --> 01:40:29,510
 

4809
01:40:28,040 --> 01:40:31,489
 performing as well but eventually they

4810
01:40:29,500 --> 01:40:31,489
 

4811
01:40:29,510 --> 01:40:32,570
 get over those humps it has to stand up

4812
01:40:31,479 --> 01:40:32,570
 

4813
01:40:31,489 --> 01:40:34,310
 and notice that in the original

4814
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:34,310
 

4815
01:40:32,570 --> 01:40:35,690
 environment the creature is not standing

4816
01:40:34,300 --> 01:40:35,690
 

4817
01:40:34,310 --> 01:40:38,420
 up it's dragging its knee which is not a

4818
01:40:35,680 --> 01:40:38,420
 

4819
01:40:35,690 --> 01:40:40,160
 very healthy behavior but once this

4820
01:40:38,410 --> 01:40:40,160
 

4821
01:40:38,420 --> 01:40:41,719
 creature in the new environment stands

4822
01:40:40,150 --> 01:40:41,719
 

4823
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:43,850
 up and starts walking it actually is

4824
01:40:41,709 --> 01:40:43,850
 

4825
01:40:41,719 --> 01:40:46,219
 performing pretty well and periodically

4826
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:46,219
 

4827
01:40:43,850 --> 01:40:47,989
 we're testing every agent to see if it's

4828
01:40:46,209 --> 01:40:47,989
 

4829
01:40:46,219 --> 01:40:49,670
 good in any of the other niches and it

4830
01:40:47,979 --> 01:40:49,670
 

4831
01:40:47,989 --> 01:40:51,680
 just so happens that that descendant

4832
01:40:49,660 --> 01:40:51,680
 

4833
01:40:49,670 --> 01:40:53,840
 agent goes back to the original really

4834
01:40:51,670 --> 01:40:53,840
 

4835
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:55,310
 simple problem and starts doing better

4836
01:40:53,830 --> 01:40:55,310
 

4837
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:57,920
 because now it's standing up and it's

4838
01:40:55,300 --> 01:40:57,920
 

4839
01:40:55,310 --> 01:40:59,630
 performing better than its and it's the

4840
01:40:57,910 --> 01:40:59,630
 

4841
01:40:57,920 --> 01:41:01,040
 original agent and then it gets further

4842
01:40:59,620 --> 01:41:01,040
 

4843
01:40:59,630 --> 01:41:02,750
 optimized and does quite well in that

4844
01:41:01,030 --> 01:41:02,750
 

4845
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:05,810
 environment original eventually is going

4846
01:41:02,740 --> 01:41:05,810
 

4847
01:41:02,750 --> 01:41:07,850
 349 in the original simple flat problem

4848
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:07,850
 

4849
01:41:05,810 --> 01:41:09,920
 we did the counterfactual we went back

4850
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:09,920
 

4851
01:41:07,850 --> 01:41:11,420
 to the 298 agent and we just ran it

4852
01:41:09,910 --> 01:41:11,420
 

4853
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:13,489
 forever we gave it tons and tons of

4854
01:41:11,410 --> 01:41:13,489
 

4855
01:41:11,420 --> 01:41:15,710
 computation and it was stuck on a local

4856
01:41:13,479 --> 01:41:15,710
 

4857
01:41:13,489 --> 01:41:17,000
 Optima it never stood up the move if you

4858
01:41:15,700 --> 01:41:17,000
 

4859
01:41:15,710 --> 01:41:19,250
 just let that thing run forever

4860
01:41:16,990 --> 01:41:19,250
 

4861
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:20,449
 it only gets a score of 309 and it keeps

4862
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:20,449
 

4863
01:41:19,250 --> 01:41:21,949
 that knee on the ground for whatever

4864
01:41:20,439 --> 01:41:21,949
 

4865
01:41:20,449 --> 01:41:24,440
 reason because the landscape is

4866
01:41:21,939 --> 01:41:24,440
 

4867
01:41:21,949 --> 01:41:26,390
 deceptive so counter intuitively in this

4868
01:41:24,430 --> 01:41:26,390
 

4869
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:28,550
 particular problem you had to go from a

4870
01:41:26,380 --> 01:41:28,550
 

4871
01:41:26,390 --> 01:41:30,800
 simple problem to a harder problem

4872
01:41:28,540 --> 01:41:30,800
 

4873
01:41:28,550 --> 01:41:32,360
 and then come back to the simple problem

4874
01:41:30,790 --> 01:41:32,360
 

4875
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:33,920
 in order to get the right solution to

4876
01:41:32,350 --> 01:41:33,920
 

4877
01:41:32,360 --> 01:41:35,270
 the simple problem which is just a

4878
01:41:33,910 --> 01:41:35,270
 

4879
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:36,980
 curriculum that a human would never

4880
01:41:35,260 --> 01:41:36,980
 

4881
01:41:35,270 --> 01:41:38,690
 design but these algorithms figure out

4882
01:41:36,970 --> 01:41:38,690
 

4883
01:41:36,980 --> 01:41:41,390
 on their own which is the beauty of

4884
01:41:38,680 --> 01:41:41,390
 

4885
01:41:38,690 --> 01:41:43,190
 these things so very quickly poet is

4886
01:41:41,380 --> 01:41:43,190
 

4887
01:41:41,390 --> 01:41:45,260
 kind of quality diversity plus plus

4888
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:45,260
 

4889
01:41:43,190 --> 01:41:47,270
 because as Ken said it breaks the mold

4890
01:41:45,250 --> 01:41:47,270
 

4891
01:41:45,260 --> 01:41:48,800
 it now can generate its own niches in

4892
01:41:47,260 --> 01:41:48,800
 

4893
01:41:47,270 --> 01:41:51,050
 addition to trying to have all the other

4894
01:41:48,790 --> 01:41:51,050
 

4895
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:53,570
 properties is it truly open-ended well

4896
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:53,570
 

4897
01:41:51,050 --> 01:41:55,160
 no it's not because well it's definitely

4898
01:41:53,560 --> 01:41:55,160
 

4899
01:41:53,570 --> 01:41:56,990
 a step closer because it's generating

4900
01:41:55,150 --> 01:41:56,990
 

4901
01:41:55,160 --> 01:41:58,040
 its own niches it's currently limited by

4902
01:41:56,980 --> 01:41:58,040
 

4903
01:41:56,990 --> 01:41:59,810
 the fact that we picked a specific

4904
01:41:58,030 --> 01:41:59,810
 

4905
01:41:58,040 --> 01:42:01,400
 physics emulator and a specific way to

4906
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:01,400
 

4907
01:41:59,810 --> 01:42:03,620
 parameterize environments in that

4908
01:42:01,390 --> 01:42:03,620
 

4909
01:42:01,400 --> 01:42:04,970
 physics simulator so ultimately what we

4910
01:42:03,610 --> 01:42:04,970
 

4911
01:42:03,620 --> 01:42:06,380
 wanted we challenged everyone in this

4912
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:06,380
 

4913
01:42:04,970 --> 01:42:08,030
 room and the community to figure out is

4914
01:42:06,370 --> 01:42:08,030
 

4915
01:42:06,380 --> 01:42:10,190
 how do we have a more expressive way to

4916
01:42:08,020 --> 01:42:10,190
 

4917
01:42:08,030 --> 01:42:11,480
 encode environments and express them so

4918
01:42:10,180 --> 01:42:11,480
 

4919
01:42:10,190 --> 01:42:12,980
 we can search through the space of

4920
01:42:11,470 --> 01:42:12,980
 

4921
01:42:11,480 --> 01:42:15,710
 challenges while we have all these other

4922
01:42:12,970 --> 01:42:15,710
 

4923
01:42:12,980 --> 01:42:17,240
 healthy dynamics going on and our most

4924
01:42:15,700 --> 01:42:17,240
 

4925
01:42:15,710 --> 01:42:19,070
 recent attempt at that actually is a

4926
01:42:17,230 --> 01:42:19,070
 

4927
01:42:17,240 --> 01:42:21,260
 little plug for our poster at the Otto

4928
01:42:19,060 --> 01:42:21,260
 

4929
01:42:19,070 --> 01:42:22,670
 ml workshop this Friday is what we call

4930
01:42:21,250 --> 01:42:22,670
 

4931
01:42:21,260 --> 01:42:24,200
 generative teaching networks which are

4932
01:42:22,660 --> 01:42:24,200
 

4933
01:42:22,670 --> 01:42:26,390
 fully expressive environmental and

4934
01:42:24,190 --> 01:42:26,390
 

4935
01:42:24,200 --> 01:42:28,280
 coatings that can encode any environment

4936
01:42:26,380 --> 01:42:28,280
 

4937
01:42:26,390 --> 01:42:30,080
 but they will see how well they perform

4938
01:42:28,270 --> 01:42:30,080
 

4939
01:42:28,280 --> 01:42:31,280
 when paired with poet so I just want to

4940
01:42:30,070 --> 01:42:31,280
 

4941
01:42:30,080 --> 01:42:33,500
 quickly end by saying that these

4942
01:42:31,270 --> 01:42:33,500
 

4943
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:35,090
 algorithms beyond poet all of the

4944
01:42:33,490 --> 01:42:35,090
 

4945
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:37,040
 algorithms that the general idea of

4946
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:37,040
 

4947
01:42:35,090 --> 01:42:38,630
 automatically generating both the

4948
01:42:37,030 --> 01:42:38,630
 

4949
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:39,950
 challenges and the solutions we think is

4950
01:42:38,620 --> 01:42:39,950
 

4951
01:42:38,630 --> 01:42:42,020
 really powerful because it invents a

4952
01:42:39,940 --> 01:42:42,020
 

4953
01:42:39,950 --> 01:42:43,400
 curriculum whereas manual curriculum

4954
01:42:42,010 --> 01:42:43,400
 

4955
01:42:42,020 --> 01:42:45,500
 attempts are very very difficult to get

4956
01:42:43,390 --> 01:42:45,500
 

4957
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:46,850
 right and often fail because the

4958
01:42:45,490 --> 01:42:46,850
 

4959
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:48,500
 solutions of the right curricula often

4960
01:42:46,840 --> 01:42:48,500
 

4961
01:42:46,850 --> 01:42:49,850
 counterintuitive these algorithms have

4962
01:42:48,490 --> 01:42:49,850
 

4963
01:42:48,500 --> 01:42:50,840
 the potential to endlessly innovate

4964
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:50,840
 

4965
01:42:49,850 --> 01:42:53,120
 especially if they have the right

4966
01:42:50,830 --> 01:42:53,120
 

4967
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:55,460
 expressive and encoding of environments

4968
01:42:53,110 --> 01:42:55,460
 

4969
01:42:53,120 --> 01:42:57,860
 they may be the only way to solve really

4970
01:42:55,450 --> 01:42:57,860
 

4971
01:42:55,460 --> 01:42:59,570
 ambitious problems and it's discover the

4972
01:42:57,850 --> 01:42:59,570
 

4973
01:42:57,860 --> 01:43:01,580
 full gamut of what is possible out there

4974
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:01,580
 

4975
01:42:59,570 --> 01:43:04,190
 and they're beginning to start capturing

4976
01:43:01,570 --> 01:43:04,190
 

4977
01:43:01,580 --> 01:43:06,110
 the spirit of open-ended engines of

4978
01:43:04,180 --> 01:43:06,110
 

4979
01:43:04,190 --> 01:43:07,550
 innovation like natural evolution and

4980
01:43:06,100 --> 01:43:07,550
 

4981
01:43:06,110 --> 01:43:09,020
 cultural evolution and science and

4982
01:43:07,540 --> 01:43:09,020
 

4983
01:43:07,550 --> 01:43:10,250
 technology and art and therefore we

4984
01:43:09,010 --> 01:43:10,250
 

4985
01:43:09,020 --> 01:43:12,440
 think these are extremely promising

4986
01:43:10,240 --> 01:43:12,440
 

4987
01:43:10,250 --> 01:43:14,240
 going forward as optimization algorithms

4988
01:43:12,430 --> 01:43:14,240
 

4989
01:43:12,440 --> 01:43:16,010
 to solve our most ambitious challenges

4990
01:43:14,230 --> 01:43:16,010
 

4991
01:43:14,240 --> 01:43:17,480
 and with that Ken's gonna come back up

4992
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,480
 

4993
01:43:16,010 --> 01:43:19,370
 talk about indirect encoding that I'm

4994
01:43:17,470 --> 01:43:19,370
 

4995
01:43:17,480 --> 01:43:20,450
 gonna do a little bit of look looking

4996
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:20,450
 

4997
01:43:19,370 --> 01:43:23,290
 forward and concluding and then we'll

4998
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:23,290
 

4999
01:43:20,450 --> 01:43:23,290
 have a Q&A session

5000
01:43:47,660 --> 01:43:47,660
 

5001
01:43:47,670 --> 01:43:52,680
 okay now this is a bit of a transition

5002
01:43:50,510 --> 01:43:52,680
 

5003
01:43:50,520 --> 01:43:55,030
 we're gonna be talking about a

5004
01:43:52,670 --> 01:43:55,030
 

5005
01:43:52,680 --> 01:43:56,440
 representational issue now so you may

5006
01:43:55,020 --> 01:43:56,440
 

5007
01:43:55,030 --> 01:43:59,470
 say well how does all this lead up to

5008
01:43:56,430 --> 01:43:59,470
 

5009
01:43:56,440 --> 01:44:01,720
 represent to the representation and so

5010
01:43:59,460 --> 01:44:01,720
 

5011
01:43:59,470 --> 01:44:03,700
 the real answer is that when you're in

5012
01:44:01,710 --> 01:44:03,700
 

5013
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:04,900
 the pursuit of diversity as really you

5014
01:44:03,690 --> 01:44:04,900
 

5015
01:44:03,700 --> 01:44:07,660
 could see that's the spirit of a lot of

5016
01:44:04,890 --> 01:44:07,660
 

5017
01:44:04,900 --> 01:44:09,820
 what we've been talking about here it is

5018
01:44:07,650 --> 01:44:09,820
 

5019
01:44:07,660 --> 01:44:12,370
 really important that your trajectories

5020
01:44:09,810 --> 01:44:12,370
 

5021
01:44:09,820 --> 01:44:15,550
 that you follow through that space have

5022
01:44:12,360 --> 01:44:15,550
 

5023
01:44:12,370 --> 01:44:17,770
 some kind of principle behind them and

5024
01:44:15,540 --> 01:44:17,770
 

5025
01:44:15,550 --> 01:44:19,300
 that they respect regularities and you

5026
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:19,300
 

5027
01:44:17,770 --> 01:44:21,340
 can discover regularities and preserve

5028
01:44:19,290 --> 01:44:21,340
 

5029
01:44:19,300 --> 01:44:23,560
 those regularities in the structures

5030
01:44:21,330 --> 01:44:23,560
 

5031
01:44:21,340 --> 01:44:24,940
 that you're discovering and those

5032
01:44:23,550 --> 01:44:24,940
 

5033
01:44:23,560 --> 01:44:26,590
 regularities should be flexible and

5034
01:44:24,930 --> 01:44:26,590
 

5035
01:44:24,940 --> 01:44:29,260
 allow exceptions like so you can get

5036
01:44:26,580 --> 01:44:29,260
 

5037
01:44:26,590 --> 01:44:30,850
 things like brains which certainly have

5038
01:44:29,250 --> 01:44:30,850
 

5039
01:44:29,260 --> 01:44:32,560
 regular structure and we can you know

5040
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:32,560
 

5041
01:44:30,850 --> 01:44:34,540
 the theme of convolution is going to

5042
01:44:32,550 --> 01:44:34,540
 

5043
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:35,650
 come up I think several times as I just

5044
01:44:34,530 --> 01:44:35,650
 

5045
01:44:34,540 --> 01:44:38,080
 talked about this because that's like

5046
01:44:35,640 --> 01:44:38,080
 

5047
01:44:35,650 --> 01:44:40,239
 one of the most salient kind of examples

5048
01:44:38,070 --> 01:44:40,239
 

5049
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:41,830
 of a very regular type of structure

5050
01:44:40,229 --> 01:44:41,830
 

5051
01:44:40,239 --> 01:44:44,320
 that's very powerful in a certain type

5052
01:44:41,820 --> 01:44:44,320
 

5053
01:44:41,830 --> 01:44:45,940
 of domain and processing and so we'd

5054
01:44:44,310 --> 01:44:45,940
 

5055
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:47,890
 like to be able to exploit such

5056
01:44:45,930 --> 01:44:47,890
 

5057
01:44:45,940 --> 01:44:51,540
 regularities but also elaborate on them

5058
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:51,540
 

5059
01:44:47,890 --> 01:44:53,350
 in any kind of divergent process and so

5060
01:44:51,530 --> 01:44:53,350
 

5061
01:44:51,540 --> 01:44:55,960
 what we're going to talk about is

5062
01:44:53,340 --> 01:44:55,960
 

5063
01:44:53,350 --> 01:44:57,370
 representation and but it is related to

5064
01:44:55,950 --> 01:44:57,370
 

5065
01:44:55,960 --> 01:44:59,110
 population based services because of

5066
01:44:57,360 --> 01:44:59,110
 

5067
01:44:57,370 --> 01:45:01,000
 this principle but also because this was

5068
01:44:59,100 --> 01:45:01,000
 

5069
01:44:59,110 --> 01:45:03,070
 inspired by population search to begin

5070
01:45:00,990 --> 01:45:03,070
 

5071
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:05,170
 to look into this issue of how

5072
01:45:03,060 --> 01:45:05,170
 

5073
01:45:03,070 --> 01:45:06,520
 representation can be powerful and I

5074
01:45:05,160 --> 01:45:06,520
 

5075
01:45:05,170 --> 01:45:09,010
 think you'll see and appreciate what I

5076
01:45:06,510 --> 01:45:09,010
 

5077
01:45:06,520 --> 01:45:10,870
 mean as I show you this so we're talking

5078
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:10,870
 

5079
01:45:09,010 --> 01:45:12,610
 about something called indirect encoding

5080
01:45:10,860 --> 01:45:12,610
 

5081
01:45:10,870 --> 01:45:13,900
 and this is the idea that something like

5082
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:13,900
 

5083
01:45:12,610 --> 01:45:16,390
 a gene which really just means a

5084
01:45:13,890 --> 01:45:16,390
 

5085
01:45:13,900 --> 01:45:19,180
 parameter does not map directly to a

5086
01:45:16,380 --> 01:45:19,180
 

5087
01:45:16,390 --> 01:45:22,300
 unit of structure in what we might call

5088
01:45:19,170 --> 01:45:22,300
 

5089
01:45:19,180 --> 01:45:24,489
 the phenotype or the final realized the

5090
01:45:22,290 --> 01:45:24,489
 

5091
01:45:22,300 --> 01:45:26,230
 final realized entity which could be

5092
01:45:24,479 --> 01:45:26,230
 

5093
01:45:24,489 --> 01:45:27,970
 like a body or it could be something

5094
01:45:26,220 --> 01:45:27,970
 

5095
01:45:26,230 --> 01:45:30,430
 like a brain or like a neural network

5096
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:30,430
 

5097
01:45:27,970 --> 01:45:32,590
 and so the idea here is then that

5098
01:45:30,420 --> 01:45:32,590
 

5099
01:45:30,430 --> 01:45:34,390
 there's reuse inside of an indirect

5100
01:45:32,580 --> 01:45:34,390
 

5101
01:45:32,590 --> 01:45:36,700
 encoding because it's not a one-to-one

5102
01:45:34,380 --> 01:45:36,700
 

5103
01:45:34,390 --> 01:45:38,380
 mapping so information that's inside of

5104
01:45:36,690 --> 01:45:38,380
 

5105
01:45:36,700 --> 01:45:41,880
 the representation of what you're

5106
01:45:38,370 --> 01:45:41,880
 

5107
01:45:38,380 --> 01:45:44,950
 searching through can be reused and so

5108
01:45:41,870 --> 01:45:44,950
 

5109
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:46,900
 because of that development from DNA is

5110
01:45:44,940 --> 01:45:46,900
 

5111
01:45:44,950 --> 01:45:49,780
 sort of an inspiration for this type of

5112
01:45:46,890 --> 01:45:49,780
 

5113
01:45:46,900 --> 01:45:52,270
 an encoding called an indirect encoding

5114
01:45:49,770 --> 01:45:52,270
 

5115
01:45:49,780 --> 01:45:55,030
 and I highlighted inspiration because

5116
01:45:52,260 --> 01:45:55,030
 

5117
01:45:52,270 --> 01:45:57,040
 we're not interested in simulating DNA I

5118
01:45:55,020 --> 01:45:57,040
 

5119
01:45:55,030 --> 01:45:57,770
 mean this is artificial intelligence and

5120
01:45:57,030 --> 01:45:57,770
 

5121
01:45:57,040 --> 01:45:59,810
 machine learning

5122
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:59,810
 

5123
01:45:57,770 --> 01:46:02,060
 but we're inspired by it because it has

5124
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:02,060
 

5125
01:45:59,810 --> 01:46:03,980
 this particular property which is look

5126
01:46:02,050 --> 01:46:03,980
 

5127
01:46:02,060 --> 01:46:05,990
 you can get these kinds of things like

5128
01:46:03,970 --> 01:46:05,990
 

5129
01:46:03,980 --> 01:46:07,850
 you can get symmetries you can get

5130
01:46:05,980 --> 01:46:07,850
 

5131
01:46:05,990 --> 01:46:09,860
 repetition and this is like cortical

5132
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:09,860
 

5133
01:46:07,850 --> 01:46:10,730
 cortical columns for example and you can

5134
01:46:09,850 --> 01:46:10,730
 

5135
01:46:09,860 --> 01:46:12,230
 get this kind of thing which is

5136
01:46:10,720 --> 01:46:12,230
 

5137
01:46:10,730 --> 01:46:14,630
 repetition with variation and the point

5138
01:46:12,220 --> 01:46:14,630
 

5139
01:46:12,230 --> 01:46:16,790
 is like every finger here is not encoded

5140
01:46:14,620 --> 01:46:16,790
 

5141
01:46:14,630 --> 01:46:19,340
 with different information they largely

5142
01:46:16,780 --> 01:46:19,340
 

5143
01:46:16,790 --> 01:46:20,900
 share information in terms of what kinds

5144
01:46:19,330 --> 01:46:20,900
 

5145
01:46:19,340 --> 01:46:23,300
 of DNA is mapping to each one of these

5146
01:46:20,890 --> 01:46:23,300
 

5147
01:46:20,900 --> 01:46:25,430
 fingers but there's some differences as

5148
01:46:23,290 --> 01:46:25,430
 

5149
01:46:23,300 --> 01:46:27,410
 well and this kind of subtle variation

5150
01:46:25,420 --> 01:46:27,410
 

5151
01:46:25,430 --> 01:46:29,000
 is the kind of power that we want in any

5152
01:46:27,400 --> 01:46:29,000
 

5153
01:46:27,410 --> 01:46:30,620
 kind of representation that we would be

5154
01:46:28,990 --> 01:46:30,620
 

5155
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:32,810
 using if we want to be able to be

5156
01:46:30,610 --> 01:46:32,810
 

5157
01:46:30,620 --> 01:46:34,940
 creative sort of forever and so we're

5158
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:34,940
 

5159
01:46:32,810 --> 01:46:36,380
 interested in encoding spaces for very

5160
01:46:34,930 --> 01:46:36,380
 

5161
01:46:34,940 --> 01:46:38,090
 interesting types of things and if you

5162
01:46:36,370 --> 01:46:38,090
 

5163
01:46:36,380 --> 01:46:39,440
 want to make it more concrete think

5164
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:39,440
 

5165
01:46:38,090 --> 01:46:40,970
 about neural network architectures like

5166
01:46:39,430 --> 01:46:40,970
 

5167
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:42,980
 that's one thing we might want to search

5168
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:42,980
 

5169
01:46:40,970 --> 01:46:45,560
 through in this in the spirit and so

5170
01:46:42,970 --> 01:46:45,560
 

5171
01:46:42,980 --> 01:46:47,000
 there's a long history actually for for

5172
01:46:45,550 --> 01:46:47,000
 

5173
01:46:45,560 --> 01:46:48,170
 indirect encoding it's gone by a number

5174
01:46:46,990 --> 01:46:48,170
 

5175
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:50,120
 of different names but I'm gonna use

5176
01:46:48,160 --> 01:46:50,120
 

5177
01:46:48,170 --> 01:46:51,680
 indirect encoding but it goes back all

5178
01:46:50,110 --> 01:46:51,680
 

5179
01:46:50,120 --> 01:46:53,930
 the way to Turing and he was interested

5180
01:46:51,670 --> 01:46:53,930
 

5181
01:46:51,680 --> 01:46:55,520
 in morphogenesis and so he used what are

5182
01:46:53,920 --> 01:46:55,520
 

5183
01:46:53,930 --> 01:46:57,950
 called reaction diffusion equations to

5184
01:46:55,510 --> 01:46:57,950
 

5185
01:46:55,520 --> 01:47:00,080
 look at pattern generation another older

5186
01:46:57,940 --> 01:47:00,080
 

5187
01:46:57,950 --> 01:47:01,610
 example is Linda Meyer who invented it's

5188
01:47:00,070 --> 01:47:01,610
 

5189
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:04,520
 called L systems which were a

5190
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:04,520
 

5191
01:47:01,610 --> 01:47:07,520
 grammatical system for for abstracting

5192
01:47:04,510 --> 01:47:07,520
 

5193
01:47:04,520 --> 01:47:09,290
 how plants develop and there's in fact a

5194
01:47:07,510 --> 01:47:09,290
 

5195
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:11,090
 long history after that of people

5196
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:11,090
 

5197
01:47:09,290 --> 01:47:13,820
 looking at indirect encodings and just

5198
01:47:11,080 --> 01:47:13,820
 

5199
01:47:11,090 --> 01:47:15,380
 want to acknowledge this history as I

5200
01:47:13,810 --> 01:47:15,380
 

5201
01:47:13,820 --> 01:47:17,240
 jump to now what we're going to talk

5202
01:47:15,370 --> 01:47:17,240
 

5203
01:47:15,380 --> 01:47:19,340
 about mostly here which is what's called

5204
01:47:17,230 --> 01:47:19,340
 

5205
01:47:17,240 --> 01:47:21,560
 compositional pattern producing networks

5206
01:47:19,330 --> 01:47:21,560
 

5207
01:47:19,340 --> 01:47:23,300
 this is from our own work because these

5208
01:47:21,550 --> 01:47:23,300
 

5209
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:25,160
 are really suited to particularly

5210
01:47:23,290 --> 01:47:25,160
 

5211
01:47:23,300 --> 01:47:26,870
 encoding neural networks as you'll see

5212
01:47:25,150 --> 01:47:26,870
 

5213
01:47:25,160 --> 01:47:28,340
 so if you bear with me you'll see how

5214
01:47:26,860 --> 01:47:28,340
 

5215
01:47:26,870 --> 01:47:30,380
 this is going towards sort of modern

5216
01:47:28,330 --> 01:47:30,380
 

5217
01:47:28,340 --> 01:47:32,780
 deep learning but for a moment I just

5218
01:47:30,370 --> 01:47:32,780
 

5219
01:47:30,380 --> 01:47:34,610
 want to dwell on structure and not worry

5220
01:47:32,770 --> 01:47:34,610
 

5221
01:47:32,780 --> 01:47:37,760
 about neural network so in Lourdes I

5222
01:47:34,600 --> 01:47:37,760
 

5223
01:47:34,610 --> 01:47:39,920
 want to think about an artificial

5224
01:47:37,750 --> 01:47:39,920
 

5225
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:41,440
 encoding that can produce stuff that has

5226
01:47:39,910 --> 01:47:41,440
 

5227
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:43,610
 the properties I mentioned like symmetry

5228
01:47:41,430 --> 01:47:43,610
 

5229
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:45,650
 repetition and repetition with variation

5230
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:45,650
 

5231
01:47:43,610 --> 01:47:47,690
 in structure in in some kind of

5232
01:47:45,640 --> 01:47:47,690
 

5233
01:47:45,650 --> 01:47:49,250
 systematic and principled way and that's

5234
01:47:47,680 --> 01:47:49,250
 

5235
01:47:47,690 --> 01:47:51,170
 what cpp ends are designed to do an

5236
01:47:49,240 --> 01:47:51,170
 

5237
01:47:49,250 --> 01:47:54,350
 eventual transfer that capability over

5238
01:47:51,160 --> 01:47:54,350
 

5239
01:47:51,170 --> 01:47:59,720
 to encoding neural network structure and

5240
01:47:54,340 --> 01:47:59,720
 

5241
01:47:54,350 --> 01:48:01,010
 so here's an insight in embryo Genie

5242
01:47:59,710 --> 01:48:01,010
 

5243
01:47:59,720 --> 01:48:02,930
 which means like in the process of

5244
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:02,930
 

5245
01:48:01,010 --> 01:48:08,300
 generating an embryo into and to a full

5246
01:48:02,920 --> 01:48:08,300
 

5247
01:48:02,930 --> 01:48:09,890
 fully formed infant cells know where

5248
01:48:08,290 --> 01:48:09,890
 

5249
01:48:08,300 --> 01:48:11,059
 they are through what's called chemical

5250
01:48:09,880 --> 01:48:11,059
 

5251
01:48:09,890 --> 01:48:13,909
 gradients

5252
01:48:11,049 --> 01:48:13,909
 

5253
01:48:11,059 --> 01:48:16,219
 and so where you are is really important

5254
01:48:13,899 --> 01:48:16,219
 

5255
01:48:13,909 --> 01:48:18,079
 because to know what you're supposed to

5256
01:48:16,209 --> 01:48:18,079
 

5257
01:48:16,219 --> 01:48:20,210
 do you need to know where you are are

5258
01:48:18,069 --> 01:48:20,210
 

5259
01:48:18,079 --> 01:48:21,860
 you in a brain then you should be a

5260
01:48:20,200 --> 01:48:21,860
 

5261
01:48:20,210 --> 01:48:24,440
 brain cell are you in a liver you should

5262
01:48:21,850 --> 01:48:24,440
 

5263
01:48:21,860 --> 01:48:25,940
 be a liver cell so where is the key to

5264
01:48:24,430 --> 01:48:25,940
 

5265
01:48:24,440 --> 01:48:27,949
 knowing what kind of structure you are

5266
01:48:25,930 --> 01:48:27,949
 

5267
01:48:25,940 --> 01:48:29,300
 and then these gradients can be thought

5268
01:48:27,939 --> 01:48:29,300
 

5269
01:48:27,949 --> 01:48:31,070
 of as forming like coordinate frames

5270
01:48:29,290 --> 01:48:31,070
 

5271
01:48:29,300 --> 01:48:33,289
 within weight within which things are

5272
01:48:31,060 --> 01:48:33,289
 

5273
01:48:31,070 --> 01:48:34,909
 situated like am I on the left side or

5274
01:48:33,279 --> 01:48:34,909
 

5275
01:48:33,289 --> 01:48:37,300
 the right side or the head or the tail

5276
01:48:34,899 --> 01:48:37,300
 

5277
01:48:34,909 --> 01:48:39,800
 and or the front or the back and

5278
01:48:37,290 --> 01:48:39,800
 

5279
01:48:37,300 --> 01:48:41,030
 gradients of chemicals are used in order

5280
01:48:39,790 --> 01:48:41,030
 

5281
01:48:39,800 --> 01:48:42,920
 to situate structure and this has been

5282
01:48:41,020 --> 01:48:42,920
 

5283
01:48:41,030 --> 01:48:46,159
 described eloquently and for example

5284
01:48:42,910 --> 01:48:46,159
 

5285
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:48,500
 this classic book by mine heart about

5286
01:48:46,149 --> 01:48:48,500
 

5287
01:48:46,159 --> 01:48:50,840
 the models of biological pattern

5288
01:48:48,490 --> 01:48:50,840
 

5289
01:48:48,500 --> 01:48:52,369
 formation and showing sort of how these

5290
01:48:50,830 --> 01:48:52,369
 

5291
01:48:50,840 --> 01:48:54,170
 gradients are used in this case to form

5292
01:48:52,359 --> 01:48:54,170
 

5293
01:48:52,369 --> 01:48:56,119
 like drosophila padma striped patterns

5294
01:48:54,160 --> 01:48:56,119
 

5295
01:48:54,170 --> 01:48:58,070
 and so there's been much study of this

5296
01:48:56,109 --> 01:48:58,070
 

5297
01:48:56,119 --> 01:49:00,320
 in biology but let's switch away from

5298
01:48:58,060 --> 01:49:00,320
 

5299
01:48:58,070 --> 01:49:01,849
 biology and think about this from the

5300
01:49:00,310 --> 01:49:01,849
 

5301
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:03,860
 more perspective of sort of abstract

5302
01:49:01,839 --> 01:49:03,860
 

5303
01:49:01,849 --> 01:49:06,739
 representations from machine learning so

5304
01:49:03,850 --> 01:49:06,739
 

5305
01:49:03,860 --> 01:49:08,030
 for example we know that like gradients

5306
01:49:06,729 --> 01:49:08,030
 

5307
01:49:06,739 --> 01:49:09,710
 can define axes and i'm talking about

5308
01:49:08,020 --> 01:49:09,710
 

5309
01:49:08,030 --> 01:49:12,320
 chemical gradients not like gradients in

5310
01:49:09,700 --> 01:49:12,320
 

5311
01:49:09,710 --> 01:49:13,639
 terms of like derivatives chemical

5312
01:49:12,310 --> 01:49:13,639
 

5313
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:15,260
 Granny's can define axes and these

5314
01:49:13,629 --> 01:49:15,260
 

5315
01:49:13,639 --> 01:49:16,969
 gradients tell where you are so like you

5316
01:49:15,250 --> 01:49:16,969
 

5317
01:49:15,260 --> 01:49:18,739
 can imagine that within a cell like the

5318
01:49:16,959 --> 01:49:18,739
 

5319
01:49:16,969 --> 01:49:20,780
 initial cell after sort of the sperm

5320
01:49:18,729 --> 01:49:20,780
 

5321
01:49:18,739 --> 01:49:22,309
 fertilizes an egg there could be like a

5322
01:49:20,770 --> 01:49:22,309
 

5323
01:49:20,780 --> 01:49:23,869
 couple axes so I'll stay in two

5324
01:49:22,299 --> 01:49:23,869
 

5325
01:49:22,309 --> 01:49:24,980
 dimensions for simplicity even though of

5326
01:49:23,859 --> 01:49:24,980
 

5327
01:49:23,869 --> 01:49:27,440
 course we live in a three-dimensional

5328
01:49:24,970 --> 01:49:27,440
 

5329
01:49:24,980 --> 01:49:28,820
 world so there's a y axis this is one

5330
01:49:27,430 --> 01:49:28,820
 

5331
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:30,409
 gradient the excess is another gradient

5332
01:49:28,810 --> 01:49:30,409
 

5333
01:49:28,820 --> 01:49:31,789
 now I know where I am so if I query this

5334
01:49:30,399 --> 01:49:31,789
 

5335
01:49:30,409 --> 01:49:33,530
 point I would know where I am

5336
01:49:31,779 --> 01:49:33,530
 

5337
01:49:31,789 --> 01:49:35,420
 just based on chemical concentrations

5338
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:35,420
 

5339
01:49:33,530 --> 01:49:37,730
 well it's kind of interesting to observe

5340
01:49:35,410 --> 01:49:37,730
 

5341
01:49:35,420 --> 01:49:39,349
 that we can just describe this kind of

5342
01:49:37,720 --> 01:49:39,349
 

5343
01:49:37,730 --> 01:49:41,210
 the kind of process of setting up these

5344
01:49:39,339 --> 01:49:41,210
 

5345
01:49:39,349 --> 01:49:43,070
 gradients mathematically instead which

5346
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:43,070
 

5347
01:49:41,210 --> 01:49:44,599
 is really simple it's just function

5348
01:49:43,060 --> 01:49:44,599
 

5349
01:49:43,070 --> 01:49:46,159
 composition and in other words if I

5350
01:49:44,589 --> 01:49:46,159
 

5351
01:49:44,599 --> 01:49:47,599
 started out with this asymmetric

5352
01:49:46,149 --> 01:49:47,599
 

5353
01:49:46,159 --> 01:49:49,190
 gradient like basically this is going

5354
01:49:47,589 --> 01:49:49,190
 

5355
01:49:47,599 --> 01:49:51,139
 from low concentration to high

5356
01:49:49,180 --> 01:49:51,139
 

5357
01:49:49,190 --> 01:49:52,940
 concentration it's a very simple like

5358
01:49:51,129 --> 01:49:52,940
 

5359
01:49:51,139 --> 01:49:54,559
 identity function well then I can take a

5360
01:49:52,930 --> 01:49:54,559
 

5361
01:49:52,940 --> 01:49:56,480
 function of that like in this case they

5362
01:49:54,549 --> 01:49:56,480
 

5363
01:49:54,559 --> 01:49:58,250
 just put absolute value and that becomes

5364
01:49:56,470 --> 01:49:58,250
 

5365
01:49:56,480 --> 01:49:59,389
 a symmetric gradient but then I can take

5366
01:49:58,240 --> 01:49:59,389
 

5367
01:49:58,250 --> 01:50:00,739
 another function of that which I haven't

5368
01:49:59,379 --> 01:50:00,739
 

5369
01:49:59,389 --> 01:50:02,719
 fully defined but basically saying if

5370
01:50:00,729 --> 01:50:02,719
 

5371
01:50:00,739 --> 01:50:05,000
 there's a function of say X and this

5372
01:50:02,709 --> 01:50:05,000
 

5373
01:50:02,719 --> 01:50:06,739
 function G then I could situate new

5374
01:50:04,990 --> 01:50:06,739
 

5375
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,760
 structure inside of that symmetric frame

5376
01:50:06,729 --> 01:50:07,760
 

5377
01:50:06,739 --> 01:50:09,469
 and this will be guaranteed to be

5378
01:50:07,750 --> 01:50:09,469
 

5379
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:11,389
 symmetric function for a symmetric

5380
01:50:09,459 --> 01:50:11,389
 

5381
01:50:09,469 --> 01:50:12,909
 structure because any function of a

5382
01:50:11,379 --> 01:50:12,909
 

5383
01:50:11,389 --> 01:50:15,590
 symmetric function will itself be

5384
01:50:12,899 --> 01:50:15,590
 

5385
01:50:12,909 --> 01:50:17,300
 symmetric on its output and so the point

5386
01:50:15,580 --> 01:50:17,300
 

5387
01:50:15,590 --> 01:50:19,280
 is that we can compose gradients and

5388
01:50:17,290 --> 01:50:19,280
 

5389
01:50:17,300 --> 01:50:21,230
 this is like describing a developmental

5390
01:50:19,270 --> 01:50:21,230
 

5391
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:22,750
 process you know like if you have a

5392
01:50:21,220 --> 01:50:22,750
 

5393
01:50:21,230 --> 01:50:24,220
 symmetric gradient and then you feed

5394
01:50:22,740 --> 01:50:24,220
 

5395
01:50:22,750 --> 01:50:25,690
 into a periodic function which you get

5396
01:50:24,210 --> 01:50:25,690
 

5397
01:50:24,220 --> 01:50:28,090
 are segments with opposite polarities

5398
01:50:25,680 --> 01:50:28,090
 

5399
01:50:25,690 --> 01:50:30,370
 and so the composition of gradients is a

5400
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:30,370
 

5401
01:50:28,090 --> 01:50:31,570
 really powerful notion and in fact is

5402
01:50:30,360 --> 01:50:31,570
 

5403
01:50:30,370 --> 01:50:33,670
 sort of what the steps of the

5404
01:50:31,560 --> 01:50:33,670
 

5405
01:50:31,570 --> 01:50:36,070
 development of a structure is in biology

5406
01:50:33,660 --> 01:50:36,070
 

5407
01:50:33,670 --> 01:50:38,160
 and so it's an interesting question to

5408
01:50:36,060 --> 01:50:38,160
 

5409
01:50:36,070 --> 01:50:41,530
 ask is there a general abstraction of

5410
01:50:38,150 --> 01:50:41,530
 

5411
01:50:38,160 --> 01:50:43,720
 composing gradients that we could search

5412
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:43,720
 

5413
01:50:41,530 --> 01:50:45,700
 through in some principled way so that

5414
01:50:43,710 --> 01:50:45,700
 

5415
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:47,470
 we could actually find structure with

5416
01:50:45,690 --> 01:50:47,470
 

5417
01:50:45,700 --> 01:50:49,810
 regularities and symmetries and so forth

5418
01:50:47,460 --> 01:50:49,810
 

5419
01:50:47,470 --> 01:50:51,580
 and exploit that to find principled

5420
01:50:49,800 --> 01:50:51,580
 

5421
01:50:49,810 --> 01:50:53,650
 structure like brain link structures and

5422
01:50:51,570 --> 01:50:53,650
 

5423
01:50:51,580 --> 01:50:55,540
 so the idea here is gradients basically

5424
01:50:53,640 --> 01:50:55,540
 

5425
01:50:53,650 --> 01:50:57,400
 can define to find body plans you know

5426
01:50:55,530 --> 01:50:57,400
 

5427
01:50:55,540 --> 01:50:59,770
 you can imagine periodic gradients

5428
01:50:57,390 --> 01:50:59,770
 

5429
01:50:57,400 --> 01:51:02,320
 giving like segmentation symmetric

5430
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:02,320
 

5431
01:50:59,770 --> 01:51:04,240
 gradients giving symmetries so forth and

5432
01:51:02,310 --> 01:51:04,240
 

5433
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:06,340
 this gets us body plane so let's try to

5434
01:51:04,230 --> 01:51:06,340
 

5435
01:51:04,240 --> 01:51:07,600
 have an abstraction of this idea that we

5436
01:51:06,330 --> 01:51:07,600
 

5437
01:51:06,340 --> 01:51:09,130
 don't actually have to simulate

5438
01:51:07,590 --> 01:51:09,130
 

5439
01:51:07,600 --> 01:51:10,600
 development because we're not interested

5440
01:51:09,120 --> 01:51:10,600
 

5441
01:51:09,130 --> 01:51:12,760
 in simulation we're interested in

5442
01:51:10,590 --> 01:51:12,760
 

5443
01:51:10,600 --> 01:51:14,350
 machine learning and we can look at this

5444
01:51:12,750 --> 01:51:14,350
 

5445
01:51:12,760 --> 01:51:16,450
 from it from an abstract viewpoint

5446
01:51:14,340 --> 01:51:16,450
 

5447
01:51:14,350 --> 01:51:17,920
 imagine that the thing that we're gonna

5448
01:51:16,440 --> 01:51:17,920
 

5449
01:51:16,450 --> 01:51:19,870
 create we call it the phenotype does

5450
01:51:17,910 --> 01:51:19,870
 

5451
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:22,360
 some kind of pattern structure is in

5452
01:51:19,860 --> 01:51:22,360
 

5453
01:51:19,870 --> 01:51:24,490
 some kind of Cartesian space like X&Y

5454
01:51:22,350 --> 01:51:24,490
 

5455
01:51:22,360 --> 01:51:26,740
 here so a two-dimensional for simplicity

5456
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:26,740
 

5457
01:51:24,490 --> 01:51:27,940
 then what we can think of as development

5458
01:51:26,730 --> 01:51:27,940
 

5459
01:51:26,740 --> 01:51:29,650
 we can think almost like a black box

5460
01:51:27,930 --> 01:51:29,650
 

5461
01:51:27,940 --> 01:51:31,870
 like it's a function but it's a function

5462
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:31,870
 

5463
01:51:29,650 --> 01:51:33,370
 of what it's a function of space so it's

5464
01:51:31,860 --> 01:51:33,370
 

5465
01:51:31,870 --> 01:51:35,350
 a function of the initial axes of the

5466
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:35,350
 

5467
01:51:33,370 --> 01:51:36,970
 space we're like x and y and something

5468
01:51:35,340 --> 01:51:36,970
 

5469
01:51:35,350 --> 01:51:39,130
 happens in this function which basically

5470
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:39,130
 

5471
01:51:36,970 --> 01:51:40,720
 is development in in biology which will

5472
01:51:39,120 --> 01:51:40,720
 

5473
01:51:39,130 --> 01:51:42,250
 then output some kind of structure at

5474
01:51:40,710 --> 01:51:42,250
 

5475
01:51:40,720 --> 01:51:45,430
 the end which is the bye to the body

5476
01:51:42,240 --> 01:51:45,430
 

5477
01:51:42,250 --> 01:51:47,110
 when it's sort of born and so we can

5478
01:51:45,420 --> 01:51:47,110
 

5479
01:51:45,430 --> 01:51:48,370
 think of these coordinates like the x

5480
01:51:47,100 --> 01:51:48,370
 

5481
01:51:47,110 --> 01:51:50,020
 and y coordinates as the chemical

5482
01:51:48,360 --> 01:51:50,020
 

5483
01:51:48,370 --> 01:51:51,670
 gradients and then we can think of this

5484
01:51:50,010 --> 01:51:51,670
 

5485
01:51:50,020 --> 01:51:53,470
 function being applied at all points in

5486
01:51:51,660 --> 01:51:53,470
 

5487
01:51:51,670 --> 01:51:55,240
 an abstract sense by the end after the

5488
01:51:53,460 --> 01:51:55,240
 

5489
01:51:53,470 --> 01:51:57,570
 developmental process in effect the

5490
01:51:55,230 --> 01:51:57,570
 

5491
01:51:55,240 --> 01:51:59,980
 functions been applied at all points so

5492
01:51:57,560 --> 01:51:59,980
 

5493
01:51:57,570 --> 01:52:01,600
 now to capture the notion of the

5494
01:51:59,970 --> 01:52:01,600
 

5495
01:51:59,980 --> 01:52:03,280
 composition of gradients in order to get

5496
01:52:01,590 --> 01:52:03,280
 

5497
01:52:01,600 --> 01:52:05,140
 up to increasingly complex structures

5498
01:52:03,270 --> 01:52:05,140
 

5499
01:52:03,280 --> 01:52:07,390
 well it's interesting because we could

5500
01:52:05,130 --> 01:52:07,390
 

5501
01:52:05,140 --> 01:52:09,250
 draw the path of development as a graph

5502
01:52:07,380 --> 01:52:09,250
 

5503
01:52:07,390 --> 01:52:10,870
 and so like what we say is okay there's

5504
01:52:09,240 --> 01:52:10,870
 

5505
01:52:09,250 --> 01:52:12,700
 an initial sort of egg where there's x

5506
01:52:10,860 --> 01:52:12,700
 

5507
01:52:10,870 --> 01:52:15,310
 and y gradient and then it goes through

5508
01:52:12,690 --> 01:52:15,310
 

5509
01:52:12,700 --> 01:52:18,190
 these types of these types of functions

5510
01:52:15,300 --> 01:52:18,190
 

5511
01:52:15,310 --> 01:52:19,480
 as it's going up to the adult form and

5512
01:52:18,180 --> 01:52:19,480
 

5513
01:52:18,190 --> 01:52:21,550
 this is actually you can trace through

5514
01:52:19,470 --> 01:52:21,550
 

5515
01:52:19,480 --> 01:52:23,230
 these and think of as you go from bottom

5516
01:52:21,540 --> 01:52:23,230
 

5517
01:52:21,550 --> 01:52:26,020
 to top in this graph you can think of it

5518
01:52:23,220 --> 01:52:26,020
 

5519
01:52:23,230 --> 01:52:27,940
 as events that happen like a symmetric

5520
01:52:26,010 --> 01:52:27,940
 

5521
01:52:26,020 --> 01:52:30,970
 gradient is laid on top of the input

5522
01:52:27,930 --> 01:52:30,970
 

5523
01:52:27,940 --> 01:52:32,410
 gradients or this for example a periodic

5524
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:32,410
 

5525
01:52:30,970 --> 01:52:34,420
 gradient is laid on top of the output of

5526
01:52:32,400 --> 01:52:34,420
 

5527
01:52:32,410 --> 01:52:35,210
 this gradient and so forth and these are

5528
01:52:34,410 --> 01:52:35,210
 

5529
01:52:34,420 --> 01:52:36,680
 sometimes can

5530
01:52:35,200 --> 01:52:36,680
 

5531
01:52:35,210 --> 01:52:38,690
 it happened in parallel and that's why

5532
01:52:36,670 --> 01:52:38,690
 

5533
01:52:36,680 --> 01:52:40,280
 this is this is a pair both a sequential

5534
01:52:38,680 --> 01:52:40,280
 

5535
01:52:38,690 --> 01:52:42,290
 and parallel process but it all

5536
01:52:40,270 --> 01:52:42,290
 

5537
01:52:40,280 --> 01:52:44,360
 converges at the end to a final output

5538
01:52:42,280 --> 01:52:44,360
 

5539
01:52:42,290 --> 01:52:46,130
 pattern which is the phenotypic form

5540
01:52:44,350 --> 01:52:46,130
 

5541
01:52:44,360 --> 01:52:47,600
 which is the output of this function now

5542
01:52:46,120 --> 01:52:47,600
 

5543
01:52:46,130 --> 01:52:49,850
 what's really interesting about this is

5544
01:52:47,590 --> 01:52:49,850
 

5545
01:52:47,600 --> 01:52:51,560
 this graph that I just drew here looks

5546
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:51,560
 

5547
01:52:49,850 --> 01:52:53,480
 like a neural network in fact these

5548
01:52:51,550 --> 01:52:53,480
 

5549
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:55,370
 connections can be weighted and then in

5550
01:52:53,470 --> 01:52:55,370
 

5551
01:52:53,480 --> 01:52:57,710
 fact it functions just like a neural

5552
01:52:55,360 --> 01:52:57,710
 

5553
01:52:55,370 --> 01:52:59,510
 network but it's an abstraction of

5554
01:52:57,700 --> 01:52:59,510
 

5555
01:52:57,710 --> 01:53:02,540
 development not an abstraction of a

5556
01:52:59,500 --> 01:53:02,540
 

5557
01:52:59,510 --> 01:53:04,100
 brain so it's kind of interesting just

5558
01:53:02,530 --> 01:53:04,100
 

5559
01:53:02,540 --> 01:53:05,540
 generally conceptually that we can think

5560
01:53:04,090 --> 01:53:05,540
 

5561
01:53:04,100 --> 01:53:07,400
 of abstractions of brains and of

5562
01:53:05,530 --> 01:53:07,400
 

5563
01:53:05,540 --> 01:53:09,740
 development as being related to each

5564
01:53:07,390 --> 01:53:09,740
 

5565
01:53:07,400 --> 01:53:11,690
 other but computationally this is really

5566
01:53:09,730 --> 01:53:11,690
 

5567
01:53:09,740 --> 01:53:13,520
 convenient because what this means is

5568
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:13,520
 

5569
01:53:11,690 --> 01:53:16,070
 that I can get in effect what a

5570
01:53:13,510 --> 01:53:16,070
 

5571
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:17,990
 developmental process would do simply by

5572
01:53:16,060 --> 01:53:17,990
 

5573
01:53:16,070 --> 01:53:21,320
 running a network like this and getting

5574
01:53:17,980 --> 01:53:21,320
 

5575
01:53:17,990 --> 01:53:22,820
 the output of this function and so in

5576
01:53:21,310 --> 01:53:22,820
 

5577
01:53:21,320 --> 01:53:24,350
 effect this is like a connected graph

5578
01:53:22,810 --> 01:53:24,350
 

5579
01:53:22,820 --> 01:53:26,030
 abstraction of the order and

5580
01:53:24,340 --> 01:53:26,030
 

5581
01:53:24,350 --> 01:53:27,800
 relationship between developmental

5582
01:53:26,020 --> 01:53:27,800
 

5583
01:53:26,030 --> 01:53:30,260
 events and I don't have to simulate

5584
01:53:27,790 --> 01:53:30,260
 

5585
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:32,570
 growth to search through structures like

5586
01:53:30,250 --> 01:53:32,570
 

5587
01:53:30,260 --> 01:53:34,430
 this in fact I can use any modern neural

5588
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:34,430
 

5589
01:53:32,570 --> 01:53:35,450
 network toolbox the only kind of unusual

5590
01:53:34,420 --> 01:53:35,450
 

5591
01:53:34,430 --> 01:53:37,610
 thing here is that there's these

5592
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:37,610
 

5593
01:53:35,450 --> 01:53:39,590
 heterogeneous activation functions which

5594
01:53:37,600 --> 01:53:39,590
 

5595
01:53:37,610 --> 01:53:43,820
 represent certain like types of gradient

5596
01:53:39,580 --> 01:53:43,820
 

5597
01:53:39,590 --> 01:53:45,050
 patterns so we're gonna search over CPP

5598
01:53:43,810 --> 01:53:45,050
 

5599
01:53:43,820 --> 01:53:46,940
 ends this is what these are called

5600
01:53:45,040 --> 01:53:46,940
 

5601
01:53:45,050 --> 01:53:48,650
 compositional pattern producing networks

5602
01:53:46,930 --> 01:53:48,650
 

5603
01:53:46,940 --> 01:53:51,500
 that's the name for this kind of a

5604
01:53:48,640 --> 01:53:51,500
 

5605
01:53:48,650 --> 01:53:52,970
 network and to begin with we're gonna

5606
01:53:51,490 --> 01:53:52,970
 

5607
01:53:51,500 --> 01:53:55,100
 use NEET which is this

5608
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:55,100
 

5609
01:53:52,970 --> 01:53:56,840
 neuro-evolutionary technique because

5610
01:53:55,090 --> 01:53:56,840
 

5611
01:53:55,100 --> 01:53:58,340
 it's going to allow us first to look at

5612
01:53:56,830 --> 01:53:58,340
 

5613
01:53:56,840 --> 01:53:59,780
 this intuitively which is what I want to

5614
01:53:58,330 --> 01:53:59,780
 

5615
01:53:58,340 --> 01:54:01,430
 do with you first I want to give you

5616
01:53:59,770 --> 01:54:01,430
 

5617
01:53:59,780 --> 01:54:03,770
 just a sense of what these patterns look

5618
01:54:01,420 --> 01:54:03,770
 

5619
01:54:01,430 --> 01:54:05,840
 like just to see that they actually do

5620
01:54:03,760 --> 01:54:05,840
 

5621
01:54:03,770 --> 01:54:07,700
 capture a very important sort of

5622
01:54:05,830 --> 01:54:07,700
 

5623
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:09,470
 biological like principles before we

5624
01:54:07,690 --> 01:54:09,470
 

5625
01:54:07,700 --> 01:54:11,210
 then get shift over to neural networks

5626
01:54:09,460 --> 01:54:11,210
 

5627
01:54:09,470 --> 01:54:13,370
 and one of the things that neat does is

5628
01:54:11,200 --> 01:54:13,370
 

5629
01:54:11,210 --> 01:54:14,540
 it can increase complexity over time and

5630
01:54:13,360 --> 01:54:14,540
 

5631
01:54:13,370 --> 01:54:16,130
 so that's one of the reasons our gonna

5632
01:54:14,530 --> 01:54:16,130
 

5633
01:54:14,540 --> 01:54:19,930
 use this because of course complexity

5634
01:54:16,120 --> 01:54:19,930
 

5635
01:54:16,130 --> 01:54:22,760
 does increase over a biological time and

5636
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:22,760
 

5637
01:54:19,930 --> 01:54:24,290
 so let's remember this this is actually

5638
01:54:22,750 --> 01:54:24,290
 

5639
01:54:22,760 --> 01:54:25,820
 from the pic breeder but just to remind

5640
01:54:24,280 --> 01:54:25,820
 

5641
01:54:24,290 --> 01:54:26,690
 you like this is just a game where you

5642
01:54:25,810 --> 01:54:26,690
 

5643
01:54:25,820 --> 01:54:28,310
 could play where I could select

5644
01:54:26,680 --> 01:54:28,310
 

5645
01:54:26,690 --> 01:54:30,260
 something get perturbations select

5646
01:54:28,300 --> 01:54:30,260
 

5647
01:54:28,310 --> 01:54:32,720
 something get perturbations and now this

5648
01:54:30,250 --> 01:54:32,720
 

5649
01:54:30,260 --> 01:54:34,460
 was used to get the following examples

5650
01:54:32,710 --> 01:54:34,460
 

5651
01:54:32,720 --> 01:54:36,140
 very simple but I just want to show you

5652
01:54:34,450 --> 01:54:36,140
 

5653
01:54:34,460 --> 01:54:38,420
 some examples so that we can analyze the

5654
01:54:36,130 --> 01:54:38,420
 

5655
01:54:36,140 --> 01:54:41,150
 patterns so for example this sequence

5656
01:54:38,410 --> 01:54:41,150
 

5657
01:54:38,420 --> 01:54:43,250
 here like of that looks like spaceships

5658
01:54:41,140 --> 01:54:43,250
 

5659
01:54:41,150 --> 01:54:44,570
 I just want you to notice one particular

5660
01:54:43,240 --> 01:54:44,570
 

5661
01:54:43,250 --> 01:54:46,730
 discovery I think is really really

5662
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:46,730
 

5663
01:54:44,570 --> 01:54:48,050
 interesting which is between here and

5664
01:54:46,720 --> 01:54:48,050
 

5665
01:54:46,730 --> 01:54:51,140
 here what you

5666
01:54:48,040 --> 01:54:51,140
 

5667
01:54:48,050 --> 01:54:52,880
 as tailfins were invented now this is it

5668
01:54:51,130 --> 01:54:52,880
 

5669
01:54:51,140 --> 01:54:54,410
 this is a really interesting discovery

5670
01:54:52,870 --> 01:54:54,410
 

5671
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:56,810
 because like the system there's nothing

5672
01:54:54,400 --> 01:54:56,810
 

5673
01:54:54,410 --> 01:54:58,970
 about tail fins in fact this is a this

5674
01:54:56,800 --> 01:54:58,970
 

5675
01:54:56,810 --> 01:55:00,560
 is just a CP PN so it started out here

5676
01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:00,560
 

5677
01:54:58,970 --> 01:55:01,880
 with this and it ended up here with that

5678
01:55:00,550 --> 01:55:01,880
 

5679
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:03,710
 and this is in the middle of this

5680
01:55:01,870 --> 01:55:03,710
 

5681
01:55:01,880 --> 01:55:05,660
 process just some perturbation led to

5682
01:55:03,700 --> 01:55:05,660
 

5683
01:55:03,710 --> 01:55:07,370
 this but why were they discovered

5684
01:55:05,650 --> 01:55:07,370
 

5685
01:55:05,660 --> 01:55:09,290
 together in this symmetric way which

5686
01:55:07,360 --> 01:55:09,290
 

5687
01:55:07,370 --> 01:55:10,880
 seems to make so much sense when it

5688
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:10,880
 

5689
01:55:09,290 --> 01:55:12,620
 doesn't know anything about this well

5690
01:55:10,870 --> 01:55:12,620
 

5691
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:14,780
 because this is like a biological like

5692
01:55:12,610 --> 01:55:14,780
 

5693
01:55:12,620 --> 01:55:16,820
 principle right I mean when something

5694
01:55:14,770 --> 01:55:16,820
 

5695
01:55:14,780 --> 01:55:18,830
 changes about arms like for example like

5696
01:55:16,810 --> 01:55:18,830
 

5697
01:55:16,820 --> 01:55:20,720
 the development of digits on hands we

5698
01:55:18,820 --> 01:55:20,720
 

5699
01:55:18,830 --> 01:55:22,340
 don't want it to happen only on one side

5700
01:55:20,710 --> 01:55:22,340
 

5701
01:55:20,720 --> 01:55:24,350
 I wanted to happen on both sides and

5702
01:55:22,330 --> 01:55:24,350
 

5703
01:55:22,340 --> 01:55:26,360
 because we have a representation here

5704
01:55:24,340 --> 01:55:26,360
 

5705
01:55:24,350 --> 01:55:28,220
 where symmetry has been captured

5706
01:55:26,350 --> 01:55:28,220
 

5707
01:55:26,360 --> 01:55:29,600
 somewhere do somewhere near the inputs

5708
01:55:28,210 --> 01:55:29,600
 

5709
01:55:28,220 --> 01:55:31,940
 to the system remember the inputs are

5710
01:55:29,590 --> 01:55:31,940
 

5711
01:55:29,600 --> 01:55:34,250
 like the X and y axis of the original

5712
01:55:31,930 --> 01:55:34,250
 

5713
01:55:31,940 --> 01:55:36,140
 embryo well then everything that comes

5714
01:55:34,240 --> 01:55:36,140
 

5715
01:55:34,250 --> 01:55:37,670
 above that symmetry will inherit that

5716
01:55:36,130 --> 01:55:37,670
 

5717
01:55:36,140 --> 01:55:39,710
 symmetry so as you go towards the

5718
01:55:37,660 --> 01:55:39,710
 

5719
01:55:37,670 --> 01:55:42,020
 outputs and so we can respect the

5720
01:55:39,700 --> 01:55:42,020
 

5721
01:55:39,710 --> 01:55:44,390
 principle of symmetry and so we can get

5722
01:55:42,010 --> 01:55:44,390
 

5723
01:55:42,020 --> 01:55:46,430
 these kinds of almost natural like

5724
01:55:44,380 --> 01:55:46,430
 

5725
01:55:44,390 --> 01:55:47,420
 progressions with respect principles

5726
01:55:46,420 --> 01:55:47,420
 

5727
01:55:46,430 --> 01:55:49,070
 that have been discovered so you think

5728
01:55:47,410 --> 01:55:49,070
 

5729
01:55:47,420 --> 01:55:50,420
 of something like convolution if we

5730
01:55:49,060 --> 01:55:50,420
 

5731
01:55:49,070 --> 01:55:52,250
 discovered convolution we'd like to

5732
01:55:50,410 --> 01:55:52,250
 

5733
01:55:50,420 --> 01:55:54,020
 respect that discovery and then

5734
01:55:52,240 --> 01:55:54,020
 

5735
01:55:52,250 --> 01:55:55,430
 elaborate on it so we could do something

5736
01:55:54,010 --> 01:55:55,430
 

5737
01:55:54,020 --> 01:55:57,620
 like this like we can get repetition

5738
01:55:55,420 --> 01:55:57,620
 

5739
01:55:55,430 --> 01:55:59,720
 with variation very naturally and so

5740
01:55:57,610 --> 01:55:59,720
 

5741
01:55:57,620 --> 01:56:03,020
 these patterns come out all the time in

5742
01:55:59,710 --> 01:56:03,020
 

5743
01:55:59,720 --> 01:56:04,520
 cpp ends where it looks like almost like

5744
01:56:03,010 --> 01:56:04,520
 

5745
01:56:03,020 --> 01:56:06,560
 a repetitious pattern like you might

5746
01:56:04,510 --> 01:56:06,560
 

5747
01:56:04,520 --> 01:56:09,110
 even remind you Begley of something like

5748
01:56:06,550 --> 01:56:09,110
 

5749
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:12,290
 convolution but this is just a spatial

5750
01:56:09,100 --> 01:56:12,290
 

5751
01:56:09,110 --> 01:56:14,300
 pattern but the but the the pattern that

5752
01:56:12,280 --> 01:56:14,300
 

5753
01:56:12,290 --> 01:56:16,370
 every nexus is actually unique and the

5754
01:56:14,290 --> 01:56:16,370
 

5755
01:56:14,300 --> 01:56:18,260
 reason is because it's very simple what

5756
01:56:16,360 --> 01:56:18,260
 

5757
01:56:16,370 --> 01:56:20,180
 we have is we have basically like sine

5758
01:56:18,250 --> 01:56:20,180
 

5759
01:56:18,260 --> 01:56:22,670
 waves which are like periodic functions

5760
01:56:20,170 --> 01:56:22,670
 

5761
01:56:20,180 --> 01:56:23,990
 coming in for X and y but we also have

5762
01:56:22,660 --> 01:56:23,990
 

5763
01:56:22,670 --> 01:56:26,300
 something else that's not a sine wave

5764
01:56:23,980 --> 01:56:26,300
 

5765
01:56:23,990 --> 01:56:29,600
 coming in so if you are a function of

5766
01:56:26,290 --> 01:56:29,600
 

5767
01:56:26,300 --> 01:56:31,190
 both periodic and not periodic inputs

5768
01:56:29,590 --> 01:56:31,190
 

5769
01:56:29,600 --> 01:56:33,500
 then you will get repetition with

5770
01:56:31,180 --> 01:56:33,500
 

5771
01:56:31,190 --> 01:56:35,110
 variation very simply and so it can be

5772
01:56:33,490 --> 01:56:35,110
 

5773
01:56:33,500 --> 01:56:37,790
 explained through like this gradient

5774
01:56:35,100 --> 01:56:37,790
 

5775
01:56:35,110 --> 01:56:42,260
 concept and so like these are just other

5776
01:56:37,780 --> 01:56:42,260
 

5777
01:56:37,790 --> 01:56:44,270
 pictures of this kind of thing and if

5778
01:56:42,250 --> 01:56:44,270
 

5779
01:56:42,260 --> 01:56:46,940
 you think about these kinds of patterns

5780
01:56:44,260 --> 01:56:46,940
 

5781
01:56:44,270 --> 01:56:50,360
 it's interesting to think about the the

5782
01:56:46,930 --> 01:56:50,360
 

5783
01:56:46,940 --> 01:56:51,830
 extreme uniformity and regularity of the

5784
01:56:50,350 --> 01:56:51,830
 

5785
01:56:50,360 --> 01:56:53,540
 kinds of neural structures that were

5786
01:56:51,820 --> 01:56:53,540
 

5787
01:56:51,830 --> 01:56:55,520
 familiar with today like say a

5788
01:56:53,530 --> 01:56:55,520
 

5789
01:56:53,540 --> 01:56:57,230
 convolutional structure where in effect

5790
01:56:55,510 --> 01:56:57,230
 

5791
01:56:55,520 --> 01:56:58,760
 like inside of a filter the same

5792
01:56:57,220 --> 01:56:58,760
 

5793
01:56:57,230 --> 01:56:59,950
 operation is performed at many many

5794
01:56:58,750 --> 01:56:59,950
 

5795
01:56:58,760 --> 01:57:02,410
 different location many

5796
01:56:59,940 --> 01:57:02,410
 

5797
01:56:59,950 --> 01:57:05,020
 locations in space but it's exactly the

5798
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:05,020
 

5799
01:57:02,410 --> 01:57:06,910
 same stereotyped operation as you can

5800
01:57:05,010 --> 01:57:06,910
 

5801
01:57:05,020 --> 01:57:09,040
 see we could have subtle variation

5802
01:57:06,900 --> 01:57:09,040
 

5803
01:57:06,910 --> 01:57:10,450
 across the field even as we respect a

5804
01:57:09,030 --> 01:57:10,450
 

5805
01:57:09,040 --> 01:57:12,880
 general principle which is repetition

5806
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:12,880
 

5807
01:57:10,450 --> 01:57:14,830
 with variation with up the power of an

5808
01:57:12,870 --> 01:57:14,830
 

5809
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:17,200
 encoding like this which gives us the

5810
01:57:14,820 --> 01:57:17,200
 

5811
01:57:14,830 --> 01:57:20,050
 opportunity to consider lots of richer

5812
01:57:17,190 --> 01:57:20,050
 

5813
01:57:17,200 --> 01:57:22,120
 different kinds of principles but that's

5814
01:57:20,040 --> 01:57:22,120
 

5815
01:57:20,050 --> 01:57:24,520
 still respect regularity in some way and

5816
01:57:22,110 --> 01:57:24,520
 

5817
01:57:22,120 --> 01:57:25,900
 infect all those all those patterns and

5818
01:57:24,510 --> 01:57:25,900
 

5819
01:57:24,520 --> 01:57:27,880
 pick breeder that you saw before

5820
01:57:25,890 --> 01:57:27,880
 

5821
01:57:25,900 --> 01:57:29,770
 they're also represented by cppm so that

5822
01:57:27,870 --> 01:57:29,770
 

5823
01:57:27,880 --> 01:57:33,670
 kind of partly explains why they have

5824
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:33,670
 

5825
01:57:29,770 --> 01:57:36,540
 this kind of very familiar reminiscence

5826
01:57:33,660 --> 01:57:36,540
 

5827
01:57:33,670 --> 01:57:39,220
 of sort of biological structures and so

5828
01:57:36,530 --> 01:57:39,220
 

5829
01:57:36,540 --> 01:57:40,690
 what do we wish we could do here is we

5830
01:57:39,210 --> 01:57:40,690
 

5831
01:57:39,220 --> 01:57:43,030
 could take these kinds of

5832
01:57:40,680 --> 01:57:43,030
 

5833
01:57:40,690 --> 01:57:44,560
 representations and use them to encode

5834
01:57:43,020 --> 01:57:44,560
 

5835
01:57:43,030 --> 01:57:46,300
 neural networks that would be naturally

5836
01:57:44,550 --> 01:57:46,300
 

5837
01:57:44,560 --> 01:57:47,560
 like the cool thing right so we have

5838
01:57:46,290 --> 01:57:47,560
 

5839
01:57:46,300 --> 01:57:49,930
 this ability to encode like these really

5840
01:57:47,550 --> 01:57:49,930
 

5841
01:57:47,560 --> 01:57:51,040
 large complicated patterns which have

5842
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:51,040
 

5843
01:57:49,930 --> 01:57:53,170
 symmetries and regularities and

5844
01:57:51,030 --> 01:57:53,170
 

5845
01:57:51,040 --> 01:57:55,150
 repetition with variation so how can we

5846
01:57:53,160 --> 01:57:55,150
 

5847
01:57:53,170 --> 01:57:58,660
 do that and that was called originally

5848
01:57:55,140 --> 01:57:58,660
 

5849
01:57:55,150 --> 01:58:01,060
 hyper neat or which stands for hypercube

5850
01:57:58,650 --> 01:58:01,060
 

5851
01:57:58,660 --> 01:58:03,310
 base need and the hypercube part comes

5852
01:58:01,050 --> 01:58:03,310
 

5853
01:58:01,060 --> 01:58:04,660
 in because the main insight is okay

5854
01:58:03,300 --> 01:58:04,660
 

5855
01:58:03,310 --> 01:58:05,770
 let's say we have these patterns and we

5856
01:58:04,650 --> 01:58:05,770
 

5857
01:58:04,660 --> 01:58:07,300
 want to interpret them as neural

5858
01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:07,300
 

5859
01:58:05,770 --> 01:58:09,190
 networks well what we have if you look

5860
01:58:07,290 --> 01:58:09,190
 

5861
01:58:07,300 --> 01:58:10,540
 here is like we have a network and this

5862
01:58:09,180 --> 01:58:10,540
 

5863
01:58:09,190 --> 01:58:13,240
 is a really simple network here with x

5864
01:58:10,530 --> 01:58:13,240
 

5865
01:58:10,540 --> 01:58:15,250
 and y and like if there is a symmetric

5866
01:58:13,230 --> 01:58:15,250
 

5867
01:58:13,240 --> 01:58:17,110
 function inside of here like this G

5868
01:58:15,240 --> 01:58:17,110
 

5869
01:58:15,250 --> 01:58:18,400
 means like a Gaussian for example what

5870
01:58:17,100 --> 01:58:18,400
 

5871
01:58:17,110 --> 01:58:21,850
 will get a gradient pattern like this

5872
01:58:18,390 --> 01:58:21,850
 

5873
01:58:18,400 --> 01:58:23,260
 which is symmetric and we wish we could

5874
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:23,260
 

5875
01:58:21,850 --> 01:58:24,520
 just do that in connectivity like we

5876
01:58:23,250 --> 01:58:24,520
 

5877
01:58:23,260 --> 01:58:26,200
 wish we could output not a symmetric

5878
01:58:24,510 --> 01:58:26,200
 

5879
01:58:24,520 --> 01:58:28,150
 gradient pattern but we wish we could

5880
01:58:26,190 --> 01:58:28,150
 

5881
01:58:26,200 --> 01:58:29,950
 just output a symmetric network pattern

5882
01:58:28,140 --> 01:58:29,950
 

5883
01:58:28,150 --> 01:58:32,230
 because then we could interpret it as a

5884
01:58:29,940 --> 01:58:32,230
 

5885
01:58:29,950 --> 01:58:35,770
 neural network and in fact that's easy

5886
01:58:32,220 --> 01:58:35,770
 

5887
01:58:32,230 --> 01:58:39,250
 to do is the great news because it's the

5888
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:39,250
 

5889
01:58:35,770 --> 01:58:41,470
 fact is that a 2d 2d connections which

5890
01:58:39,240 --> 01:58:41,470
 

5891
01:58:39,250 --> 01:58:43,270
 means connections that connect nodes

5892
01:58:41,460 --> 01:58:43,270
 

5893
01:58:41,470 --> 01:58:45,790
 that are situated in two-dimensional

5894
01:58:43,260 --> 01:58:45,790
 

5895
01:58:43,270 --> 01:58:48,000
 space are isomorphic to four-dimensional

5896
01:58:45,780 --> 01:58:48,000
 

5897
01:58:45,790 --> 01:58:50,380
 points and what I mean by that is a

5898
01:58:47,990 --> 01:58:50,380
 

5899
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:53,110
 connection between two two-dimensional

5900
01:58:50,370 --> 01:58:53,110
 

5901
01:58:50,380 --> 01:58:56,140
 points is identified by four spatial

5902
01:58:53,100 --> 01:58:56,140
 

5903
01:58:53,110 --> 01:58:58,780
 dimensions right the the x1y1 of the

5904
01:58:56,130 --> 01:58:58,780
 

5905
01:58:56,140 --> 01:59:01,390
 source node and the x2y2 of the target

5906
01:58:58,770 --> 01:59:01,390
 

5907
01:58:58,780 --> 01:59:03,580
 node and so if we think of x1 y1 x2 y2

5908
01:59:01,380 --> 01:59:03,580
 

5909
01:59:01,390 --> 01:59:05,890
 as a point in four-dimensional space

5910
01:59:03,570 --> 01:59:05,890
 

5911
01:59:03,580 --> 01:59:07,540
 then all we're talking about is painting

5912
01:59:05,880 --> 01:59:07,540
 

5913
01:59:05,890 --> 01:59:09,370
 patterns like this instead of in two

5914
01:59:07,530 --> 01:59:09,370
 

5915
01:59:07,540 --> 01:59:10,630
 dimensions in four dimensions and that's

5916
01:59:09,360 --> 01:59:10,630
 

5917
01:59:09,370 --> 01:59:13,010
 why it's called the hypercube based

5918
01:59:10,620 --> 01:59:13,010
 

5919
01:59:10,630 --> 01:59:15,140
 because basically it's painting

5920
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,140
 

5921
01:59:13,010 --> 01:59:17,900
 inside of a hypercube with a/c PPN and

5922
01:59:15,130 --> 01:59:17,900
 

5923
01:59:15,140 --> 01:59:20,810
 once we do that then we can interpret

5924
01:59:17,890 --> 01:59:20,810
 

5925
01:59:17,900 --> 01:59:22,190
 the output of this it as every point in

5926
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:22,190
 

5927
01:59:20,810 --> 01:59:23,870
 four-dimensional space identifies a

5928
01:59:22,180 --> 01:59:23,870
 

5929
01:59:22,190 --> 01:59:26,360
 connection so let's say I laid out a

5930
01:59:23,860 --> 01:59:26,360
 

5931
01:59:23,870 --> 01:59:28,340
 five by five grid here then I can query

5932
01:59:26,350 --> 01:59:28,340
 

5933
01:59:26,360 --> 01:59:30,320
 every potential connection and ask

5934
01:59:28,330 --> 01:59:30,320
 

5935
01:59:28,340 --> 01:59:32,120
 whether it's connected for example by

5936
01:59:30,310 --> 01:59:32,120
 

5937
01:59:30,320 --> 01:59:34,070
 placing a threshold on the output of the

5938
01:59:32,110 --> 01:59:34,070
 

5939
01:59:32,120 --> 01:59:35,989
 of the CP PN and so you can see this

5940
01:59:34,060 --> 01:59:35,989
 

5941
01:59:34,070 --> 01:59:37,489
 this CP PN actually does output this

5942
01:59:35,979 --> 01:59:37,489
 

5943
01:59:35,989 --> 01:59:39,380
 pattern if I have a threshold for

5944
01:59:37,479 --> 01:59:39,380
 

5945
01:59:37,489 --> 01:59:42,350
 whether I show you the connection or not

5946
01:59:39,370 --> 01:59:42,350
 

5947
01:59:39,380 --> 01:59:44,450
 and and so we can now actually transfer

5948
01:59:42,340 --> 01:59:44,450
 

5949
01:59:42,350 --> 01:59:45,770
 all of the capabilities that we saw in

5950
01:59:44,440 --> 01:59:45,770
 

5951
01:59:44,450 --> 01:59:47,660
 sort of generating this kind of stuff

5952
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:47,660
 

5953
01:59:45,770 --> 01:59:49,430
 into generating networks and that's what

5954
01:59:47,650 --> 01:59:49,430
 

5955
01:59:47,660 --> 01:59:52,550
 hyper neat is it's basically a four

5956
01:59:49,420 --> 01:59:52,550
 

5957
01:59:49,430 --> 01:59:55,520
 dimensional CP PN and so we call the

5958
01:59:52,540 --> 01:59:55,520
 

5959
01:59:52,550 --> 01:59:57,110
 target the target grid of points the

5960
01:59:55,510 --> 01:59:57,110
 

5961
01:59:55,520 --> 01:59:59,330
 substrate so there's a substrate of

5962
01:59:57,100 --> 01:59:59,330
 

5963
01:59:57,110 --> 02:00:01,340
 nodes that are situated in space and

5964
01:59:59,320 --> 02:00:01,340
 

5965
01:59:59,330 --> 02:00:03,500
 then the CP pn will output a pattern

5966
02:00:01,330 --> 02:00:03,500
 

5967
02:00:01,340 --> 02:00:05,630
 which is then painted across this to get

5968
02:00:03,490 --> 02:00:05,630
 

5969
02:00:03,500 --> 02:00:07,820
 a connectivity pattern so it fective Lee

5970
02:00:05,620 --> 02:00:07,820
 

5971
02:00:05,630 --> 02:00:09,530
 is seeing geometry right like the this

5972
02:00:07,810 --> 02:00:09,530
 

5973
02:00:07,820 --> 02:00:11,150
 CP PN is computing a pattern as a

5974
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:11,150
 

5975
02:00:09,530 --> 02:00:14,989
 function of the geometry of these nodes

5976
02:00:11,140 --> 02:00:14,989
 

5977
02:00:11,150 --> 02:00:16,160
 and so it substrates these places where

5978
02:00:14,979 --> 02:00:16,160
 

5979
02:00:14,989 --> 02:00:18,020
 we can paint these patterns can be

5980
02:00:16,150 --> 02:00:18,020
 

5981
02:00:16,160 --> 02:00:19,790
 anything they can be a grid like this

5982
02:00:18,010 --> 02:00:19,790
 

5983
02:00:18,020 --> 02:00:21,500
 that could be radial in nature that

5984
02:00:19,780 --> 02:00:21,500
 

5985
02:00:19,790 --> 02:00:23,030
 could be three-dimensional they could be

5986
02:00:21,490 --> 02:00:23,030
 

5987
02:00:21,500 --> 02:00:25,040
 what we call sandwiches where I'm asking

5988
02:00:23,020 --> 02:00:25,040
 

5989
02:00:23,030 --> 02:00:27,230
 about connections that connect from one

5990
02:00:25,030 --> 02:00:27,230
 

5991
02:00:25,040 --> 02:00:29,180
 one one two-dimensional slice to another

5992
02:00:27,220 --> 02:00:29,180
 

5993
02:00:27,230 --> 02:00:32,239
 or they could even be stacks like this

5994
02:00:29,170 --> 02:00:32,239
 

5995
02:00:29,180 --> 02:00:33,980
 and then if we do sort of look at the

5996
02:00:32,229 --> 02:00:33,980
 

5997
02:00:32,239 --> 02:00:35,720
 patterns that are output by CP pns in

5998
02:00:33,970 --> 02:00:35,720
 

5999
02:00:33,980 --> 02:00:37,310
 connection space we see that they have

6000
02:00:35,710 --> 02:00:37,310
 

6001
02:00:35,720 --> 02:00:38,660
 the same properties as the spatial

6002
02:00:37,300 --> 02:00:38,660
 

6003
02:00:37,310 --> 02:00:40,790
 patterns like in a pig breeder type of

6004
02:00:38,650 --> 02:00:40,790
 

6005
02:00:38,660 --> 02:00:42,380
 system we can see symmetry and perfect

6006
02:00:40,780 --> 02:00:42,380
 

6007
02:00:40,790 --> 02:00:43,970
 symmetry repetition repetition with

6008
02:00:42,370 --> 02:00:43,970
 

6009
02:00:42,380 --> 02:00:46,160
 variation we get all those things now

6010
02:00:43,960 --> 02:00:46,160
 

6011
02:00:43,970 --> 02:00:47,180
 nicely but in connectivity and even if

6012
02:00:46,150 --> 02:00:47,180
 

6013
02:00:46,160 --> 02:00:48,980
 we want it to have three-dimensional

6014
02:00:47,170 --> 02:00:48,980
 

6015
02:00:47,180 --> 02:00:51,860
 connectivity structures we could have

6016
02:00:48,970 --> 02:00:51,860
 

6017
02:00:48,980 --> 02:00:55,130
 six dimensional CP pins because x1 y1 z1

6018
02:00:51,850 --> 02:00:55,130
 

6019
02:00:51,860 --> 02:00:57,260
 x2 y2 z2 and so we got all these

6020
02:00:55,120 --> 02:00:57,260
 

6021
02:00:55,130 --> 02:00:59,750
 patterns now nicely and in three

6022
02:00:57,250 --> 02:00:59,750
 

6023
02:00:57,260 --> 02:01:01,580
 dimensions we even have this really cool

6024
02:00:59,740 --> 02:01:01,580
 

6025
02:00:59,750 --> 02:01:03,410
 property of resolution independence

6026
02:01:01,570 --> 02:01:03,410
 

6027
02:01:01,580 --> 02:01:05,930
 which is basically to say I'm actually

6028
02:01:03,400 --> 02:01:05,930
 

6029
02:01:03,410 --> 02:01:08,480
 what I'm actually encoding is not some

6030
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:08,480
 

6031
02:01:05,930 --> 02:01:11,120
 fixed discrete connectivity pattern from

6032
02:01:08,470 --> 02:01:11,120
 

6033
02:01:08,480 --> 02:01:12,980
 some given CP pn like this one here but

6034
02:01:11,110 --> 02:01:12,980
 

6035
02:01:11,120 --> 02:01:14,720
 actually I can I can output that pattern

6036
02:01:12,970 --> 02:01:14,720
 

6037
02:01:12,980 --> 02:01:16,670
 at any resolution so these are two

6038
02:01:14,710 --> 02:01:16,670
 

6039
02:01:14,720 --> 02:01:17,600
 resolutions here and you can see that

6040
02:01:16,660 --> 02:01:17,600
 

6041
02:01:16,670 --> 02:01:19,340
 actually what I'm outputting is a

6042
02:01:17,590 --> 02:01:19,340
 

6043
02:01:17,600 --> 02:01:21,920
 connectivity concept not a specific

6044
02:01:19,330 --> 02:01:21,920
 

6045
02:01:19,340 --> 02:01:24,980
 connectivity which means like and here's

6046
02:01:21,910 --> 02:01:24,980
 

6047
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:29,450
 another example that it's scalable

6048
02:01:24,970 --> 02:01:29,450
 

6049
02:01:24,980 --> 02:01:31,340
 so the CP PNC's geometry and it

6050
02:01:29,440 --> 02:01:31,340
 

6051
02:01:29,450 --> 02:01:34,460
 generates the network as a function of

6052
02:01:31,330 --> 02:01:34,460
 

6053
02:01:31,340 --> 02:01:36,020
 the geometry but instead of building a

6054
02:01:34,450 --> 02:01:36,020
 

6055
02:01:34,460 --> 02:01:39,140
 mecha and building in a mechanism for

6056
02:01:36,010 --> 02:01:39,140
 

6057
02:01:36,020 --> 02:01:40,910
 processing geometry like convolution it

6058
02:01:39,130 --> 02:01:40,910
 

6059
02:01:39,140 --> 02:01:42,770
 would be interesting to have something

6060
02:01:40,900 --> 02:01:42,770
 

6061
02:01:40,910 --> 02:01:44,630
 that can build a represent that we can

6062
02:01:42,760 --> 02:01:44,630
 

6063
02:01:42,770 --> 02:01:46,670
 where we build a representation that can

6064
02:01:44,620 --> 02:01:46,670
 

6065
02:01:44,630 --> 02:01:48,590
 discover the mechanism so just to repeat

6066
02:01:46,660 --> 02:01:48,590
 

6067
02:01:46,670 --> 02:01:50,300
 that think about that for a second we

6068
02:01:48,580 --> 02:01:50,300
 

6069
02:01:48,590 --> 02:01:52,400
 build in mechanisms like convolution

6070
02:01:50,290 --> 02:01:52,400
 

6071
02:01:50,300 --> 02:01:54,890
 right now but wouldn't be nice if we had

6072
02:01:52,390 --> 02:01:54,890
 

6073
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:57,410
 the ability to search for the mechanism

6074
02:01:54,880 --> 02:01:57,410
 

6075
02:01:54,890 --> 02:01:59,300
 itself and so we can do that with this

6076
02:01:57,400 --> 02:01:59,300
 

6077
02:01:57,410 --> 02:02:00,590
 kind of thing so we can imagine like if

6078
02:01:59,290 --> 02:02:00,590
 

6079
02:01:59,300 --> 02:02:02,270
 we had like a network for playing

6080
02:02:00,580 --> 02:02:02,270
 

6081
02:02:00,590 --> 02:02:04,040
 checkers or something like we placed

6082
02:02:02,260 --> 02:02:04,040
 

6083
02:02:02,270 --> 02:02:05,840
 these connectivities on top of this

6084
02:02:04,030 --> 02:02:05,840
 

6085
02:02:04,040 --> 02:02:07,930
 structure and then we have the cpp and

6086
02:02:05,830 --> 02:02:07,930
 

6087
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:10,070
 fill in the connectivity patterns and

6088
02:02:07,920 --> 02:02:10,070
 

6089
02:02:07,930 --> 02:02:11,390
 like we actually could have more

6090
02:02:10,060 --> 02:02:11,390
 

6091
02:02:10,070 --> 02:02:13,370
 complicated structures like with

6092
02:02:11,380 --> 02:02:13,370
 

6093
02:02:11,390 --> 02:02:15,320
 multiple filters where each sheet is

6094
02:02:13,360 --> 02:02:15,320
 

6095
02:02:13,370 --> 02:02:17,000
 encoded separately like this so this

6096
02:02:15,310 --> 02:02:17,000
 

6097
02:02:15,320 --> 02:02:20,810
 looks more like what a modern covenant--

6098
02:02:16,990 --> 02:02:20,810
 

6099
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:24,050
 would look like and then we'll get we'll

6100
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:24,050
 

6101
02:02:20,810 --> 02:02:26,210
 get a patterns of connectivity that are

6102
02:02:24,040 --> 02:02:26,210
 

6103
02:02:24,050 --> 02:02:27,980
 appropriate to the specific domain and

6104
02:02:26,200 --> 02:02:27,980
 

6105
02:02:26,210 --> 02:02:29,360
 rather than show you like a result I

6106
02:02:27,970 --> 02:02:29,360
 

6107
02:02:27,980 --> 02:02:31,130
 don't want to just give a graph and say

6108
02:02:29,350 --> 02:02:31,130
 

6109
02:02:29,360 --> 02:02:32,600
 ok it learned to play checkers it's kind

6110
02:02:31,120 --> 02:02:32,600
 

6111
02:02:31,130 --> 02:02:33,980
 of boring I want to show you something

6112
02:02:32,590 --> 02:02:33,980
 

6113
02:02:32,600 --> 02:02:35,780
 certain insight about why this is so

6114
02:02:33,970 --> 02:02:35,780
 

6115
02:02:33,980 --> 02:02:37,250
 interesting we can look at the

6116
02:02:35,770 --> 02:02:37,250
 

6117
02:02:35,780 --> 02:02:38,780
 cross-sections of connectivity now

6118
02:02:37,240 --> 02:02:38,780
 

6119
02:02:37,250 --> 02:02:40,280
 spatially because they have a geometry

6120
02:02:38,770 --> 02:02:40,280
 

6121
02:02:38,780 --> 02:02:42,140
 so these are just cross-sections of

6122
02:02:40,270 --> 02:02:42,140
 

6123
02:02:40,280 --> 02:02:43,910
 connectivity and it turned out that if

6124
02:02:42,130 --> 02:02:43,910
 

6125
02:02:42,140 --> 02:02:45,890
 we look at them by eye just eyeballing

6126
02:02:43,900 --> 02:02:45,890
 

6127
02:02:43,910 --> 02:02:48,200
 them we can actually tell which networks

6128
02:02:45,880 --> 02:02:48,200
 

6129
02:02:45,890 --> 02:02:49,790
 are more general in other words some

6130
02:02:48,190 --> 02:02:49,790
 

6131
02:02:48,200 --> 02:02:51,170
 networks that were output by a process

6132
02:02:49,780 --> 02:02:51,170
 

6133
02:02:49,790 --> 02:02:52,820
 searching for cpp ends that encode

6134
02:02:51,160 --> 02:02:52,820
 

6135
02:02:51,170 --> 02:02:54,620
 neural networks that play checkers were

6136
02:02:52,810 --> 02:02:54,620
 

6137
02:02:52,820 --> 02:02:56,270
 general and could play other players and

6138
02:02:54,610 --> 02:02:56,270
 

6139
02:02:54,620 --> 02:02:58,310
 others were not and it turns out you can

6140
02:02:56,260 --> 02:02:58,310
 

6141
02:02:56,270 --> 02:03:00,410
 literally see generality and smoothness

6142
02:02:58,300 --> 02:03:00,410
 

6143
02:02:58,310 --> 02:03:01,850
 the smoothness across the geometry

6144
02:03:00,400 --> 02:03:01,850
 

6145
02:03:00,410 --> 02:03:03,650
 represents generality because it's not

6146
02:03:01,840 --> 02:03:03,650
 

6147
02:03:01,850 --> 02:03:05,210
 memorization whereas these kind of

6148
02:03:03,640 --> 02:03:05,210
 

6149
02:03:03,650 --> 02:03:06,680
 jagged structures which beat the

6150
02:03:05,200 --> 02:03:06,680
 

6151
02:03:05,210 --> 02:03:09,140
 opponent upon which they were trained

6152
02:03:06,670 --> 02:03:09,140
 

6153
02:03:06,680 --> 02:03:10,850
 are basically memorizing the game that

6154
02:03:09,130 --> 02:03:10,850
 

6155
02:03:09,140 --> 02:03:12,170
 they played and you can actually see

6156
02:03:10,840 --> 02:03:12,170
 

6157
02:03:10,850 --> 02:03:13,280
 that here and so you can see like the

6158
02:03:12,160 --> 02:03:13,280
 

6159
02:03:12,170 --> 02:03:15,560
 power of being able to represent

6160
02:03:13,270 --> 02:03:15,560
 

6161
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:17,030
 regularities across geometry it's not

6162
02:03:15,550 --> 02:03:17,030
 

6163
02:03:15,560 --> 02:03:17,690
 necessarily convolutional type of

6164
02:03:17,020 --> 02:03:17,690
 

6165
02:03:17,030 --> 02:03:19,940
 regularity

6166
02:03:17,680 --> 02:03:19,940
 

6167
02:03:17,690 --> 02:03:22,130
 there's also highly compressed so this

6168
02:03:19,930 --> 02:03:22,130
 

6169
02:03:19,940 --> 02:03:24,020
 little CP PN here with a few dozen

6170
02:03:22,120 --> 02:03:24,020
 

6171
02:03:22,130 --> 02:03:25,550
 connections is encoding these thousands

6172
02:03:24,010 --> 02:03:25,550
 

6173
02:03:24,020 --> 02:03:27,080
 of connections in this particular

6174
02:03:25,540 --> 02:03:27,080
 

6175
02:03:25,550 --> 02:03:30,560
 substrate and that's why it's very

6176
02:03:27,070 --> 02:03:30,560
 

6177
02:03:27,080 --> 02:03:32,300
 efficient to search we see regularities

6178
02:03:30,550 --> 02:03:32,300
 

6179
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:34,719
 in more than just vision like imagine

6180
02:03:32,290 --> 02:03:34,719
 

6181
02:03:32,300 --> 02:03:38,310
 controlling like a Quadra petrol bot

6182
02:03:34,709 --> 02:03:38,310
 

6183
02:03:34,719 --> 02:03:41,530
 all right and like in a quadrupedal case

6184
02:03:38,300 --> 02:03:41,530
 

6185
02:03:38,310 --> 02:03:43,090
 this is also a kind of regularity but

6186
02:03:41,520 --> 02:03:43,090
 

6187
02:03:41,530 --> 02:03:45,070
 it's not a convolutional regularity and

6188
02:03:43,080 --> 02:03:45,070
 

6189
02:03:43,090 --> 02:03:46,630
 in fact we find other kinds of

6190
02:03:45,060 --> 02:03:46,630
 

6191
02:03:45,070 --> 02:03:48,100
 regularities inside of these networks

6192
02:03:46,620 --> 02:03:48,100
 

6193
02:03:46,630 --> 02:03:50,199
 and you see the indirect are much more

6194
02:03:48,090 --> 02:03:50,199
 

6195
02:03:48,100 --> 02:03:52,000
 organized than if we just searched for

6196
02:03:50,189 --> 02:03:52,000
 

6197
02:03:50,199 --> 02:03:55,780
 every connection I sort of on its own as

6198
02:03:51,990 --> 02:03:55,780
 

6199
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:58,390
 we normally would it turns out that cpp

6200
02:03:55,770 --> 02:03:58,390
 

6201
02:03:55,780 --> 02:04:00,040
 ends in neural networks encoded by CP

6202
02:03:58,380 --> 02:04:00,040
 

6203
02:03:58,390 --> 02:04:02,350
 wounds are actually differentiable like

6204
02:04:00,030 --> 02:04:02,350
 

6205
02:04:00,040 --> 02:04:03,670
 you can actually compute the gradient

6206
02:04:02,340 --> 02:04:03,670
 

6207
02:04:02,350 --> 02:04:06,219
 back through the neural network that's

6208
02:04:03,660 --> 02:04:06,219
 

6209
02:04:03,670 --> 02:04:09,160
 encoded back into the CPP n so this is

6210
02:04:06,209 --> 02:04:09,160
 

6211
02:04:06,219 --> 02:04:11,980
 not an evolutionary principle in in

6212
02:04:09,150 --> 02:04:11,980
 

6213
02:04:09,160 --> 02:04:13,900
 principle it's actually a general

6214
02:04:11,970 --> 02:04:13,900
 

6215
02:04:11,980 --> 02:04:15,699
 principle for encoding complex

6216
02:04:13,890 --> 02:04:15,699
 

6217
02:04:13,900 --> 02:04:17,170
 structures and several groups have

6218
02:04:15,689 --> 02:04:17,170
 

6219
02:04:15,699 --> 02:04:19,090
 realized this and done it in slightly

6220
02:04:17,160 --> 02:04:19,090
 

6221
02:04:17,170 --> 02:04:20,350
 different ways like these differential

6222
02:04:19,080 --> 02:04:20,350
 

6223
02:04:19,090 --> 02:04:22,480
 pattern producing networks come from

6224
02:04:20,340 --> 02:04:22,480
 

6225
02:04:20,350 --> 02:04:25,449
 Crisanta Fernando a deep mind and his

6226
02:04:22,470 --> 02:04:25,449
 

6227
02:04:22,480 --> 02:04:26,710
 group and David HA at Google brain did

6228
02:04:25,439 --> 02:04:26,710
 

6229
02:04:25,449 --> 02:04:28,780
 these hyper network some of you might

6230
02:04:26,700 --> 02:04:28,780
 

6231
02:04:26,710 --> 02:04:29,860
 have heard of these geni is something

6232
02:04:28,770 --> 02:04:29,860
 

6233
02:04:28,780 --> 02:04:31,480
 we're going to talk about soon and

6234
02:04:29,850 --> 02:04:31,480
 

6235
02:04:29,860 --> 02:04:34,090
 introduce soon so that's just a little

6236
02:04:31,470 --> 02:04:34,090
 

6237
02:04:31,480 --> 02:04:36,640
 bit of a teaser with some surprising

6238
02:04:34,080 --> 02:04:36,640
 

6239
02:04:34,090 --> 02:04:38,199
 results on convolution and so we're

6240
02:04:36,630 --> 02:04:38,199
 

6241
02:04:36,640 --> 02:04:40,510
 starting to see people differentiating

6242
02:04:38,189 --> 02:04:40,510
 

6243
02:04:38,199 --> 02:04:41,770
 back through indirect encodings and this

6244
02:04:40,500 --> 02:04:41,770
 

6245
02:04:40,510 --> 02:04:44,680
 is I think is exciting because this is a

6246
02:04:41,760 --> 02:04:44,680
 

6247
02:04:41,770 --> 02:04:48,340
 new way to find regularities that aren't

6248
02:04:44,670 --> 02:04:48,340
 

6249
02:04:44,680 --> 02:04:51,010
 just simple convolution in fact the DPP

6250
02:04:48,330 --> 02:04:51,010
 

6251
02:04:48,340 --> 02:04:53,860
 ends that that that came from deep mind

6252
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,860
 

6253
02:04:51,010 --> 02:04:55,660
 were did find convolution and this was

6254
02:04:53,850 --> 02:04:55,660
 

6255
02:04:53,860 --> 02:04:57,100
 shown in their paper but but it's

6256
02:04:55,650 --> 02:04:57,100
 

6257
02:04:55,660 --> 02:04:59,050
 actually a really simple concept I mean

6258
02:04:57,090 --> 02:04:59,050
 

6259
02:04:57,100 --> 02:05:00,190
 to describe convolution is very simple

6260
02:04:59,040 --> 02:05:00,190
 

6261
02:04:59,050 --> 02:05:01,780
 so this isn't necessarily that

6262
02:05:00,180 --> 02:05:01,780
 

6263
02:05:00,190 --> 02:05:04,000
 impressive that it would find

6264
02:05:01,770 --> 02:05:04,000
 

6265
02:05:01,780 --> 02:05:05,860
 convolution but what it shows is that

6266
02:05:03,990 --> 02:05:05,860
 

6267
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:08,020
 you can go beyond that because look

6268
02:05:05,850 --> 02:05:08,020
 

6269
02:05:05,860 --> 02:05:09,820
 going beyond convolution is also really

6270
02:05:08,010 --> 02:05:09,820
 

6271
02:05:08,020 --> 02:05:11,590
 pretty simple in fact it's like if it's

6272
02:05:09,810 --> 02:05:11,590
 

6273
02:05:09,820 --> 02:05:13,660
 a function of the differences in the

6274
02:05:11,580 --> 02:05:13,660
 

6275
02:05:11,590 --> 02:05:15,790
 positions of the of the incoming and

6276
02:05:13,650 --> 02:05:15,790
 

6277
02:05:13,660 --> 02:05:18,580
 outgoing nodes from from x and y and

6278
02:05:15,780 --> 02:05:18,580
 

6279
02:05:15,790 --> 02:05:20,440
 also of just the incoming positions then

6280
02:05:18,570 --> 02:05:20,440
 

6281
02:05:18,580 --> 02:05:22,930
 you can get repetition with variation in

6282
02:05:20,430 --> 02:05:22,930
 

6283
02:05:20,440 --> 02:05:24,640
 convolutional structure and so actually

6284
02:05:22,920 --> 02:05:24,640
 

6285
02:05:22,930 --> 02:05:25,900
 david Hawk calls this relaxed weight

6286
02:05:24,630 --> 02:05:25,900
 

6287
02:05:24,640 --> 02:05:27,190
 sharing that sort of another name and

6288
02:05:25,890 --> 02:05:27,190
 

6289
02:05:25,900 --> 02:05:29,050
 showed it in el STM's with hyper

6290
02:05:27,180 --> 02:05:29,050
 

6291
02:05:27,190 --> 02:05:30,699
 networks and we have this ability to do

6292
02:05:29,040 --> 02:05:30,699
 

6293
02:05:29,050 --> 02:05:31,690
 these kinds of discoveries I just want

6294
02:05:30,689 --> 02:05:31,690
 

6295
02:05:30,699 --> 02:05:33,640
 to point out that there are other kinds

6296
02:05:31,680 --> 02:05:33,640
 

6297
02:05:31,690 --> 02:05:36,550
 of cppm like encodings like this is a

6298
02:05:33,630 --> 02:05:36,550
 

6299
02:05:33,640 --> 02:05:39,400
 wavelet based encoding from schmidhuber

6300
02:05:36,540 --> 02:05:39,400
 

6301
02:05:36,550 --> 02:05:40,930
 group with coot nick which actually

6302
02:05:39,390 --> 02:05:40,930
 

6303
02:05:39,400 --> 02:05:43,449
 encoded million connection neural

6304
02:05:40,920 --> 02:05:43,449
 

6305
02:05:40,930 --> 02:05:45,850
 networks and there are some interesting

6306
02:05:43,439 --> 02:05:45,850
 

6307
02:05:43,449 --> 02:05:46,810
 extensions like we'd imagine describing

6308
02:05:45,840 --> 02:05:46,810
 

6309
02:05:45,850 --> 02:05:48,430
 architecture

6310
02:05:46,800 --> 02:05:48,430
 

6311
02:05:46,810 --> 02:05:50,410
 PPN so this could be a really nice way

6312
02:05:48,420 --> 02:05:50,410
 

6313
02:05:48,430 --> 02:05:52,300
 to get regular architectures there's

6314
02:05:50,400 --> 02:05:52,300
 

6315
02:05:50,410 --> 02:05:53,740
 been work on trying to actually search

6316
02:05:52,290 --> 02:05:53,740
 

6317
02:05:52,300 --> 02:05:55,270
 through the substrate itself which is

6318
02:05:53,730 --> 02:05:55,270
 

6319
02:05:53,740 --> 02:05:56,710
 the positions of the neurons not just

6320
02:05:55,260 --> 02:05:56,710
 

6321
02:05:55,270 --> 02:05:58,540
 the connections that connect them and

6322
02:05:56,700 --> 02:05:58,540
 

6323
02:05:56,710 --> 02:06:00,940
 you can even think of cpp ends is

6324
02:05:58,530 --> 02:06:00,940
 

6325
02:05:58,540 --> 02:06:02,800
 possibly a universal learning rule so

6326
02:06:00,930 --> 02:06:02,800
 

6327
02:06:00,940 --> 02:06:04,480
 for example if it's not just a function

6328
02:06:02,790 --> 02:06:04,480
 

6329
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:06,430
 of x and y but also a function of the

6330
02:06:04,470 --> 02:06:06,430
 

6331
02:06:04,480 --> 02:06:08,500
 current activations then the output is

6332
02:06:06,420 --> 02:06:08,500
 

6333
02:06:06,430 --> 02:06:10,270
 actually a delta on the weight and this

6334
02:06:08,490 --> 02:06:10,270
 

6335
02:06:08,500 --> 02:06:12,520
 is actually a universal description of a

6336
02:06:10,260 --> 02:06:12,520
 

6337
02:06:10,270 --> 02:06:13,960
 dynamical system with a pattern of

6338
02:06:12,510 --> 02:06:13,960
 

6339
02:06:12,520 --> 02:06:17,350
 learning rules painted across the

6340
02:06:13,950 --> 02:06:17,350
 

6341
02:06:13,960 --> 02:06:18,580
 connections and this has been explored I

6342
02:06:17,340 --> 02:06:18,580
 

6343
02:06:17,350 --> 02:06:20,320
 put a little reference here for people

6344
02:06:18,570 --> 02:06:20,320
 

6345
02:06:18,580 --> 02:06:23,050
 get the slides later but there's a lot

6346
02:06:20,310 --> 02:06:23,050
 

6347
02:06:20,320 --> 02:06:24,760
 to be explored there and so there's a

6348
02:06:23,040 --> 02:06:24,760
 

6349
02:06:23,050 --> 02:06:26,320
 lot we can do with these and this is I

6350
02:06:24,750 --> 02:06:26,320
 

6351
02:06:24,760 --> 02:06:27,970
 think helpful to combine with the

6352
02:06:26,310 --> 02:06:27,970
 

6353
02:06:26,320 --> 02:06:29,830
 population-based search because it

6354
02:06:27,960 --> 02:06:29,830
 

6355
02:06:27,970 --> 02:06:31,660
 preserves regularities for the long run

6356
02:06:29,820 --> 02:06:31,660
 

6357
02:06:29,830 --> 02:06:34,080
 so we can exploit them as we diverge and

6358
02:06:31,650 --> 02:06:34,080
 

6359
02:06:31,660 --> 02:06:44,170
 now Jeff is going to wrap up and

6360
02:06:34,070 --> 02:06:44,170
 

6361
02:06:34,080 --> 02:06:46,000
 conclude for the future all right so

6362
02:06:44,160 --> 02:06:46,000
 

6363
02:06:44,170 --> 02:06:48,010
 we're gonna look forward now a bit

6364
02:06:45,990 --> 02:06:48,010
 

6365
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:51,730
 ambitiously towards where we might take

6366
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:51,730
 

6367
02:06:48,010 --> 02:06:54,700
 that where this might all take us so

6368
02:06:51,720 --> 02:06:54,700
 

6369
02:06:51,730 --> 02:06:55,780
 looking forward here one of the things I

6370
02:06:54,690 --> 02:06:55,780
 

6371
02:06:54,700 --> 02:06:57,070
 think it's really interesting to think

6372
02:06:55,770 --> 02:06:57,070
 

6373
02:06:55,780 --> 02:06:59,500
 about it's like how will we as a

6374
02:06:57,060 --> 02:06:59,500
 

6375
02:06:57,070 --> 02:07:02,200
 community achieve our most ambitious

6376
02:06:59,490 --> 02:07:02,200
 

6377
02:06:59,500 --> 02:07:03,400
 research goals and there are many and

6378
02:07:02,190 --> 02:07:03,400
 

6379
02:07:02,200 --> 02:07:04,900
 each of us might have different ones but

6380
02:07:03,390 --> 02:07:04,900
 

6381
02:07:03,400 --> 02:07:06,550
 one of them I think that we all are

6382
02:07:04,890 --> 02:07:06,550
 

6383
02:07:04,900 --> 02:07:08,050
 interested in is producing artificial

6384
02:07:06,540 --> 02:07:08,050
 

6385
02:07:06,550 --> 02:07:09,160
 general intelligence or human level

6386
02:07:08,040 --> 02:07:09,160
 

6387
02:07:08,050 --> 02:07:10,630
 intelligence whatever you want to call

6388
02:07:09,150 --> 02:07:10,630
 

6389
02:07:09,160 --> 02:07:12,130
 it and the question is how will we get

6390
02:07:10,620 --> 02:07:12,130
 

6391
02:07:10,630 --> 02:07:13,780
 there and do the lessons from this

6392
02:07:12,120 --> 02:07:13,780
 

6393
02:07:12,130 --> 02:07:15,610
 tutorial help in any way

6394
02:07:13,770 --> 02:07:15,610
 

6395
02:07:13,780 --> 02:07:16,870
 so I wanted to take a step back and

6396
02:07:15,600 --> 02:07:16,870
 

6397
02:07:15,610 --> 02:07:18,460
 think about kind of what it is that

6398
02:07:16,860 --> 02:07:18,460
 

6399
02:07:16,870 --> 02:07:21,370
 we're doing as a community and you could

6400
02:07:18,450 --> 02:07:21,370
 

6401
02:07:18,460 --> 02:07:23,380
 argue and I do that to some extent what

6402
02:07:21,360 --> 02:07:23,380
 

6403
02:07:21,370 --> 02:07:25,330
 we do is as the dominant paradigm in

6404
02:07:23,370 --> 02:07:25,330
 

6405
02:07:23,380 --> 02:07:27,670
 machine learning is that we are trying

6406
02:07:25,320 --> 02:07:27,670
 

6407
02:07:25,330 --> 02:07:30,190
 to identify piece by piece all of the

6408
02:07:27,660 --> 02:07:30,190
 

6409
02:07:27,670 --> 02:07:31,740
 building blocks of intelligence and if

6410
02:07:30,180 --> 02:07:31,740
 

6411
02:07:30,190 --> 02:07:34,330
 you look just for example at the

6412
02:07:31,730 --> 02:07:34,330
 

6413
02:07:31,740 --> 02:07:36,100
 building blocks listed here many of the

6414
02:07:34,320 --> 02:07:36,100
 

6415
02:07:34,330 --> 02:07:38,110
 papers at this conference our previous

6416
02:07:36,090 --> 02:07:38,110
 

6417
02:07:36,100 --> 02:07:39,610
 nurse and I CML and I clear our each

6418
02:07:38,100 --> 02:07:39,610
 

6419
02:07:38,110 --> 02:07:41,020
 kind of saying here's a piece I think is

6420
02:07:39,600 --> 02:07:41,020
 

6421
02:07:39,610 --> 02:07:43,090
 needed here's a piece I think is needed

6422
02:07:41,010 --> 02:07:43,090
 

6423
02:07:41,020 --> 02:07:44,530
 or here's an improvement on a piece and

6424
02:07:43,080 --> 02:07:44,530
 

6425
02:07:43,090 --> 02:07:46,300
 that kind of raises the question of how

6426
02:07:44,520 --> 02:07:46,300
 

6427
02:07:44,530 --> 02:07:47,830
 many total building blocks would we need

6428
02:07:46,290 --> 02:07:47,830
 

6429
02:07:46,300 --> 02:07:49,930
 if we wanted to build this complicated

6430
02:07:47,820 --> 02:07:49,930
 

6431
02:07:47,830 --> 02:07:52,600
 thinking machine and can we find them

6432
02:07:49,920 --> 02:07:52,600
 

6433
02:07:49,930 --> 02:07:54,460
 all this manual path to AI which I think

6434
02:07:52,590 --> 02:07:54,460
 

6435
02:07:52,600 --> 02:07:56,830
 we're all committed to is also to some

6436
02:07:54,450 --> 02:07:56,830
 

6437
02:07:54,460 --> 02:07:58,360
 extent committed to a Phase two which is

6438
02:07:56,820 --> 02:07:58,360
 

6439
02:07:56,830 --> 02:07:59,650
 to say now we at some point we have to

6440
02:07:58,350 --> 02:07:59,650
 

6441
02:07:58,360 --> 02:08:00,320
 figure out how to combine all of these

6442
02:07:59,640 --> 02:08:00,320
 

6443
02:07:59,650 --> 02:08:01,909
 buildings

6444
02:08:00,310 --> 02:08:01,909
 

6445
02:08:00,320 --> 02:08:03,559
 together into a giant complicated

6446
02:08:01,899 --> 02:08:03,559
 

6447
02:08:01,909 --> 02:08:05,840
 thinking machine which is a really

6448
02:08:03,549 --> 02:08:05,840
 

6449
02:08:03,559 --> 02:08:07,280
 Herculean task and is very daunting and

6450
02:08:05,830 --> 02:08:07,280
 

6451
02:08:05,840 --> 02:08:09,889
 I don't even know if it's possible but

6452
02:08:07,270 --> 02:08:09,889
 

6453
02:08:07,280 --> 02:08:12,679
 we're kind of implicitly committed to

6454
02:08:09,879 --> 02:08:12,679
 

6455
02:08:09,889 --> 02:08:13,849
 that so you know if you think back on

6456
02:08:12,669 --> 02:08:13,849
 

6457
02:08:12,679 --> 02:08:15,559
 the history of machine learning though

6458
02:08:13,839 --> 02:08:15,559
 

6459
02:08:13,849 --> 02:08:18,320
 there's some reason to be skeptical of

6460
02:08:15,549 --> 02:08:18,320
 

6461
02:08:15,559 --> 02:08:19,999
 this manual a passion approach to AI if

6462
02:08:18,310 --> 02:08:19,999
 

6463
02:08:18,320 --> 02:08:21,469
 you look at the history of machine

6464
02:08:19,989 --> 02:08:21,469
 

6465
02:08:19,999 --> 02:08:23,630
 learning and deep learning what you tend

6466
02:08:21,459 --> 02:08:23,630
 

6467
02:08:21,469 --> 02:08:25,820
 to see is that hand designs pipelines

6468
02:08:23,620 --> 02:08:25,820
 

6469
02:08:23,630 --> 02:08:28,340
 and systems ultimately give way to

6470
02:08:25,810 --> 02:08:28,340
 

6471
02:08:25,820 --> 02:08:29,959
 learned pipelines and systems so the

6472
02:08:28,330 --> 02:08:29,959
 

6473
02:08:28,340 --> 02:08:31,639
 classic example of this is in computer

6474
02:08:29,949 --> 02:08:31,639
 

6475
02:08:29,959 --> 02:08:33,320
 vision features where we used to hand

6476
02:08:31,629 --> 02:08:33,320
 

6477
02:08:31,639 --> 02:08:34,760
 design them and then do some learning on

6478
02:08:33,310 --> 02:08:34,760
 

6479
02:08:33,320 --> 02:08:36,860
 the top and now we learn the whole thing

6480
02:08:34,750 --> 02:08:36,860
 

6481
02:08:34,760 --> 02:08:39,019
 we used to and for hand design

6482
02:08:36,850 --> 02:08:39,019
 

6483
02:08:36,860 --> 02:08:40,639
 architectures and increasingly those are

6484
02:08:39,009 --> 02:08:40,639
 

6485
02:08:39,019 --> 02:08:42,499
 being learned we used to hand design

6486
02:08:40,629 --> 02:08:42,499
 

6487
02:08:40,639 --> 02:08:44,030
 hyper parameters and data augmentation

6488
02:08:42,489 --> 02:08:44,030
 

6489
02:08:42,499 --> 02:08:46,489
 increasingly those are being learned and

6490
02:08:44,020 --> 02:08:46,489
 

6491
02:08:44,030 --> 02:08:48,110
 that's also now being applied to RL

6492
02:08:46,479 --> 02:08:48,110
 

6493
02:08:46,489 --> 02:08:49,610
 algorithms themselves or meta learning

6494
02:08:48,100 --> 02:08:49,610
 

6495
02:08:48,110 --> 02:08:51,169
 is learning the learning algorithm as

6496
02:08:49,600 --> 02:08:51,169
 

6497
02:08:49,610 --> 02:08:53,780
 opposed to relying on our NTR

6498
02:08:51,159 --> 02:08:53,780
 

6499
02:08:51,169 --> 02:08:55,639
 intelligence to design them so this

6500
02:08:53,770 --> 02:08:55,639
 

6501
02:08:53,780 --> 02:08:58,459
 suggests an alternate path to trying to

6502
02:08:55,629 --> 02:08:58,459
 

6503
02:08:55,639 --> 02:09:00,499
 get two really really powerful AI and

6504
02:08:58,449 --> 02:09:00,499
 

6505
02:08:58,459 --> 02:09:03,409
 that is what I call AI generating

6506
02:09:00,489 --> 02:09:03,409
 

6507
02:09:00,499 --> 02:09:05,479
 algorithms or AIGA s and the idea is

6508
02:09:03,399 --> 02:09:05,479
 

6509
02:09:03,409 --> 02:09:07,070
 learn as much as possible really go

6510
02:09:05,469 --> 02:09:07,070
 

6511
02:09:05,479 --> 02:09:09,499
 all-in on the idea that we're gonna use

6512
02:09:07,060 --> 02:09:09,499
 

6513
02:09:07,070 --> 02:09:10,999
 data and learning to get there we want

6514
02:09:09,489 --> 02:09:10,999
 

6515
02:09:09,499 --> 02:09:13,369
 algorithms that bootstrap themselves

6516
02:09:10,989 --> 02:09:13,369
 

6517
02:09:10,999 --> 02:09:15,349
 from starting off very simple to

6518
02:09:13,359 --> 02:09:15,349
 

6519
02:09:13,369 --> 02:09:17,840
 ultimately producing general

6520
02:09:15,339 --> 02:09:17,840
 

6521
02:09:15,349 --> 02:09:19,699
 intelligence via an expensive outer loop

6522
02:09:17,830 --> 02:09:19,699
 

6523
02:09:17,840 --> 02:09:22,010
 algorithm that is searching to produce

6524
02:09:19,689 --> 02:09:22,010
 

6525
02:09:19,699 --> 02:09:24,469
 an inner loop agent that itself is very

6526
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,469
 

6527
02:09:22,010 --> 02:09:26,059
 sample efficient and a very general AI

6528
02:09:24,459 --> 02:09:26,059
 

6529
02:09:24,469 --> 02:09:27,860
 agent and we know that this can work

6530
02:09:26,049 --> 02:09:27,860
 

6531
02:09:26,059 --> 02:09:29,599
 because it happened on earth so I think

6532
02:09:27,850 --> 02:09:29,599
 

6533
02:09:27,860 --> 02:09:30,949
 that there is very very briefly I think

6534
02:09:29,589 --> 02:09:30,949
 

6535
02:09:29,599 --> 02:09:32,780
 that there's three pillars that are

6536
02:09:30,939 --> 02:09:32,780
 

6537
02:09:30,949 --> 02:09:34,099
 essential for this approach one is we

6538
02:09:32,770 --> 02:09:34,099
 

6539
02:09:32,780 --> 02:09:35,570
 have to medal learn the architectures

6540
02:09:34,089 --> 02:09:35,570
 

6541
02:09:34,099 --> 02:09:37,820
 two is we have to meddle learn the

6542
02:09:35,560 --> 02:09:37,820
 

6543
02:09:35,570 --> 02:09:39,590
 learning algorithms themselves and three

6544
02:09:37,810 --> 02:09:39,590
 

6545
02:09:37,820 --> 02:09:40,969
 we have to automatically generate the

6546
02:09:39,580 --> 02:09:40,969
 

6547
02:09:39,590 --> 02:09:42,469
 learning environments because as we

6548
02:09:40,959 --> 02:09:42,469
 

6549
02:09:40,969 --> 02:09:43,729
 learned throughout this talk you have to

6550
02:09:42,459 --> 02:09:43,729
 

6551
02:09:42,469 --> 02:09:45,199
 generate the problems while you're

6552
02:09:43,719 --> 02:09:45,199
 

6553
02:09:43,729 --> 02:09:47,749
 generating the solutions or you'll get

6554
02:09:45,189 --> 02:09:47,749
 

6555
02:09:45,199 --> 02:09:48,919
 stuck and so a lot of the ideas that we

6556
02:09:47,739 --> 02:09:48,919
 

6557
02:09:47,749 --> 02:09:50,599
 told you about today are very

6558
02:09:48,909 --> 02:09:50,599
 

6559
02:09:48,919 --> 02:09:52,969
 instrumental to this vision for

6560
02:09:50,589 --> 02:09:52,969
 

6561
02:09:50,599 --> 02:09:54,530
 producing AI generating algorithms you

6562
02:09:52,959 --> 02:09:54,530
 

6563
02:09:52,969 --> 02:09:55,669
 could imagine for example as Ken just

6564
02:09:54,520 --> 02:09:55,669
 

6565
02:09:54,530 --> 02:09:57,530
 described that if you want to learn

6566
02:09:55,659 --> 02:09:57,530
 

6567
02:09:55,669 --> 02:09:59,209
 architectures you might want it indirect

6568
02:09:57,520 --> 02:09:59,209
 

6569
02:09:57,530 --> 02:10:01,729
 encoding so you can get variations on

6570
02:09:59,199 --> 02:10:01,729
 

6571
02:09:59,209 --> 02:10:03,679
 say convolution for example in the human

6572
02:10:01,719 --> 02:10:03,679
 

6573
02:10:01,729 --> 02:10:05,599
 eye your local receptive fields in the

6574
02:10:03,669 --> 02:10:05,599
 

6575
02:10:03,679 --> 02:10:07,219
 center of your vision are very small but

6576
02:10:05,589 --> 02:10:07,219
 

6577
02:10:05,599 --> 02:10:08,869
 toward the periphery they kind of expand

6578
02:10:07,209 --> 02:10:08,869
 

6579
02:10:07,219 --> 02:10:10,579
 out and they're larger so that's a

6580
02:10:08,859 --> 02:10:10,579
 

6581
02:10:08,869 --> 02:10:11,959
 variation on a regular theme that we

6582
02:10:10,569 --> 02:10:11,959
 

6583
02:10:10,579 --> 02:10:13,489
 might want to automatically discovery

6584
02:10:11,949 --> 02:10:13,489
 

6585
02:10:11,959 --> 02:10:15,920
 say for within directing code

6586
02:10:13,479 --> 02:10:15,920
 

6587
02:10:13,489 --> 02:10:17,630
 but also the overall the overall thing

6588
02:10:15,910 --> 02:10:17,630
 

6589
02:10:15,920 --> 02:10:19,250
 meta-learning architectures and

6590
02:10:17,620 --> 02:10:19,250
 

6591
02:10:17,630 --> 02:10:21,680
 algorithms and generating environments

6592
02:10:19,240 --> 02:10:21,680
 

6593
02:10:19,250 --> 02:10:22,850
 itself involves all of the principles

6594
02:10:21,670 --> 02:10:22,850
 

6595
02:10:21,680 --> 02:10:25,610
 we've talked about today open-ended

6596
02:10:22,840 --> 02:10:25,610
 

6597
02:10:22,850 --> 02:10:27,290
 search and quality diversity the years

6598
02:10:25,600 --> 02:10:27,290
 

6599
02:10:25,610 --> 02:10:29,960
 kind of this expanding set of

6600
02:10:27,280 --> 02:10:29,960
 

6601
02:10:27,290 --> 02:10:31,610
 high-quality diverse solutions so a lot

6602
02:10:29,950 --> 02:10:31,610
 

6603
02:10:29,960 --> 02:10:34,010
 of the ideas that we talked about today

6604
02:10:31,600 --> 02:10:34,010
 

6605
02:10:31,610 --> 02:10:36,230
 we think are gonna be essential so AI

6606
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,230
 

6607
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:37,940
 generating algorithms we think may be

6608
02:10:36,220 --> 02:10:37,940
 

6609
02:10:36,230 --> 02:10:39,770
 the fastest path to artificial general

6610
02:10:37,930 --> 02:10:39,770
 

6611
02:10:37,940 --> 02:10:41,210
 intelligence it's interesting even if

6612
02:10:39,760 --> 02:10:41,210
 

6613
02:10:39,770 --> 02:10:42,800
 it's not because it's interesting to

6614
02:10:41,200 --> 02:10:42,800
 

6615
02:10:41,210 --> 02:10:45,200
 figure out how can simple processes

6616
02:10:42,790 --> 02:10:45,200
 

6617
02:10:42,800 --> 02:10:47,090
 bootstrap themselves up to producing

6618
02:10:45,190 --> 02:10:47,090
 

6619
02:10:45,200 --> 02:10:49,489
 astronomic complexity and intelligence

6620
02:10:47,080 --> 02:10:49,489
 

6621
02:10:47,090 --> 02:10:51,170
 has happened on earth and therefore it

6622
02:10:49,479 --> 02:10:51,170
 

6623
02:10:49,489 --> 02:10:54,020
 helps us understand our own origins even

6624
02:10:51,160 --> 02:10:54,020
 

6625
02:10:51,170 --> 02:10:55,400
 if it's not the fastest path to AI so we

6626
02:10:54,010 --> 02:10:55,400
 

6627
02:10:54,020 --> 02:10:57,230
 think that this should be a Grand

6628
02:10:55,390 --> 02:10:57,230
 

6629
02:10:55,400 --> 02:10:58,489
 Challenge of computer science research

6630
02:10:57,220 --> 02:10:58,489
 

6631
02:10:57,230 --> 02:11:00,890
 and we hope you're all interested in

6632
02:10:58,479 --> 02:11:00,890
 

6633
02:10:58,489 --> 02:11:02,630
 trying to solve it and help us work on

6634
02:11:00,880 --> 02:11:02,630
 

6635
02:11:00,890 --> 02:11:04,670
 it so I'm not going to conclude the

6636
02:11:02,620 --> 02:11:04,670
 

6637
02:11:02,630 --> 02:11:07,280
 entire tutorial in two quick slides

6638
02:11:04,660 --> 02:11:07,280
 

6639
02:11:04,670 --> 02:11:09,980
 we've introduced mainly novelty search

6640
02:11:07,270 --> 02:11:09,980
 

6641
02:11:07,280 --> 02:11:12,950
 quality diversity open-ended search

6642
02:11:09,970 --> 02:11:12,950
 

6643
02:11:09,980 --> 02:11:13,880
 algorithms and indirect encoding we hope

6644
02:11:12,940 --> 02:11:13,880
 

6645
02:11:12,950 --> 02:11:16,370
 that you agree that these are

6646
02:11:13,870 --> 02:11:16,370
 

6647
02:11:13,880 --> 02:11:18,200
 interesting powerful ideas they have

6648
02:11:16,360 --> 02:11:18,200
 

6649
02:11:16,370 --> 02:11:20,570
 empirically helped us solve previously

6650
02:11:18,190 --> 02:11:20,570
 

6651
02:11:18,200 --> 02:11:23,330
 unsolvable problems but they also kind

6652
02:11:20,560 --> 02:11:23,330
 

6653
02:11:20,570 --> 02:11:25,010
 of introduce new types or new classes of

6654
02:11:23,320 --> 02:11:25,010
 

6655
02:11:23,330 --> 02:11:26,600
 problems that we think here we hope

6656
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:26,600
 

6657
02:11:25,010 --> 02:11:27,980
 you're interested in working on and

6658
02:11:26,590 --> 02:11:27,980
 

6659
02:11:26,600 --> 02:11:29,900
 ultimately that we feel like there's

6660
02:11:27,970 --> 02:11:29,900
 

6661
02:11:27,980 --> 02:11:31,610
 kind of two twin and tangled related

6662
02:11:29,890 --> 02:11:31,610
 

6663
02:11:29,900 --> 02:11:34,370
 Grand Challenges here which is creating

6664
02:11:31,600 --> 02:11:34,370
 

6665
02:11:31,610 --> 02:11:36,620
 open-ended algorithms and AI generating

6666
02:11:34,360 --> 02:11:36,620
 

6667
02:11:34,370 --> 02:11:38,330
 algorithms so the overall conclusion is

6668
02:11:36,610 --> 02:11:38,330
 

6669
02:11:36,620 --> 02:11:39,710
 that whether descendant or conversion

6670
02:11:38,320 --> 02:11:39,710
 

6671
02:11:38,330 --> 02:11:41,570
 lots of the ideas that you heard about

6672
02:11:39,700 --> 02:11:41,570
 

6673
02:11:39,710 --> 02:11:43,100
 today are being hybridized currently

6674
02:11:41,560 --> 02:11:43,100
 

6675
02:11:41,570 --> 02:11:44,690
 within the machine learning community to

6676
02:11:43,090 --> 02:11:44,690
 

6677
02:11:43,100 --> 02:11:47,060
 great effect and you know for example

6678
02:11:44,680 --> 02:11:47,060
 

6679
02:11:44,690 --> 02:11:49,040
 all these techniques here but we think

6680
02:11:47,050 --> 02:11:49,040
 

6681
02:11:47,060 --> 02:11:50,510
 there's a potential for a lot more so we

6682
02:11:49,030 --> 02:11:50,510
 

6683
02:11:49,040 --> 02:11:52,010
 would encourage all of you like how

6684
02:11:50,500 --> 02:11:52,010
 

6685
02:11:50,510 --> 02:11:53,300
 might these ideas help with the

6686
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:53,300
 

6687
02:11:52,010 --> 02:11:54,860
 techniques you're working on and the

6688
02:11:53,290 --> 02:11:54,860
 

6689
02:11:53,300 --> 02:11:56,510
 problems that you're working on and how

6690
02:11:54,850 --> 02:11:56,510
 

6691
02:11:54,860 --> 02:11:58,460
 can you best use some of these insights

6692
02:11:56,500 --> 02:11:58,460
 

6693
02:11:56,510 --> 02:12:00,020
 and finally we just think that these

6694
02:11:58,450 --> 02:12:00,020
 

6695
02:11:58,460 --> 02:12:02,000
 ideas are really exciting because they

6696
02:12:00,010 --> 02:12:02,000
 

6697
02:12:00,020 --> 02:12:03,860
 may be true paths and really help us get

6698
02:12:01,990 --> 02:12:03,860
 

6699
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:05,390
 to our ultimate most ambitious research

6700
02:12:03,850 --> 02:12:05,390
 

6701
02:12:03,860 --> 02:12:07,340
 goals and what could be more exciting

6702
02:12:05,380 --> 02:12:07,340
 

6703
02:12:05,390 --> 02:12:08,960
 than that so with that I want to

6704
02:12:07,330 --> 02:12:08,960
 

6705
02:12:07,340 --> 02:12:10,460
 conclude please make it rate of

6706
02:12:08,950 --> 02:12:10,460
 

6707
02:12:08,960 --> 02:12:11,840
 microphones if you have QA we're happy

6708
02:12:10,450 --> 02:12:11,840
 

6709
02:12:10,460 --> 02:12:12,680
 to stay here well under the break to

6710
02:12:11,830 --> 02:12:12,680
 

6711
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:14,210
 answer questions

6712
02:12:12,670 --> 02:12:14,210
 

6713
02:12:12,680 --> 02:12:17,000
 we'll also be standing here afterwards

6714
02:12:14,200 --> 02:12:17,000
 

6715
02:12:14,210 --> 02:12:18,980
 after the Q&A so thank you again to the

6716
02:12:16,990 --> 02:12:18,980
 

6717
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:20,090
 organizers and my fellow speakers and

6718
02:12:18,970 --> 02:12:20,090
 

6719
02:12:18,980 --> 02:12:22,630
 will not take questions at the

6720
02:12:20,080 --> 02:12:22,630
 

6721
02:12:20,090 --> 02:12:22,630
 microphone

6722
02:12:31,140 --> 02:12:31,140
 

6723
02:12:31,150 --> 02:12:36,110
 is it cool if I have two questions

6724
02:12:33,810 --> 02:12:36,110
 

6725
02:12:33,820 --> 02:12:37,550
 depending on how many other people lined

6726
02:12:36,100 --> 02:12:37,550
 

6727
02:12:36,110 --> 02:12:39,950
 up maybe not maybe you get in the back

6728
02:12:37,540 --> 02:12:39,950
 

6729
02:12:37,550 --> 02:12:42,350
 in the line if you don't mind yeah sure

6730
02:12:39,940 --> 02:12:42,350
 

6731
02:12:39,950 --> 02:12:45,080
 first question is for like these

6732
02:12:42,340 --> 02:12:45,080
 

6733
02:12:42,350 --> 02:12:48,290
 algorithms that generate problems and

6734
02:12:45,070 --> 02:12:48,290
 

6735
02:12:45,080 --> 02:12:50,690
 solve these problems for the generators

6736
02:12:48,280 --> 02:12:50,690
 

6737
02:12:48,290 --> 02:12:53,720
 have you guys ever run it in ran into

6738
02:12:50,680 --> 02:12:53,720
 

6739
02:12:50,690 --> 02:12:56,870
 problems with grounding so look for a

6740
02:12:53,710 --> 02:12:56,870
 

6741
02:12:53,720 --> 02:12:59,030
 little bit of context like I work in NLP

6742
02:12:56,860 --> 02:12:59,030
 

6743
02:12:56,870 --> 02:13:03,350
 and I would totally love to be able to

6744
02:12:59,020 --> 02:13:03,350
 

6745
02:12:59,030 --> 02:13:06,260
 apply these types of concepts to NLP but

6746
02:13:03,340 --> 02:13:06,260
 

6747
02:13:03,350 --> 02:13:08,989
 obviously like I don't know the problems

6748
02:13:06,250 --> 02:13:08,989
 

6749
02:13:06,260 --> 02:13:12,890
 that you have to generate for NOP have

6750
02:13:08,979 --> 02:13:12,890
 

6751
02:13:08,989 --> 02:13:15,680
 to be grounded in well natural language

6752
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:15,680
 

6753
02:13:12,890 --> 02:13:17,930
 or natural language that looks like it's

6754
02:13:15,670 --> 02:13:17,930
 

6755
02:13:15,680 --> 02:13:19,970
 coming for humans yeah so that's a

6756
02:13:17,920 --> 02:13:19,970
 

6757
02:13:17,930 --> 02:13:21,770
 fascinating question I think that if you

6758
02:13:19,960 --> 02:13:21,770
 

6759
02:13:19,970 --> 02:13:23,000
 want to understand it and you wanted to

6760
02:13:21,760 --> 02:13:23,000
 

6761
02:13:21,770 --> 02:13:24,050
 speak our language than grounding is

6762
02:13:22,990 --> 02:13:24,050
 

6763
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:26,180
 essential and you would have to add

6764
02:13:24,040 --> 02:13:26,180
 

6765
02:13:24,050 --> 02:13:27,680
 additional things that ground it to our

6766
02:13:26,170 --> 02:13:27,680
 

6767
02:13:26,180 --> 02:13:29,090
 language but I also think it's

6768
02:13:27,670 --> 02:13:29,090
 

6769
02:13:27,680 --> 02:13:31,220
 fascinating to think about what happens

6770
02:13:29,080 --> 02:13:31,220
 

6771
02:13:29,090 --> 02:13:33,140
 if you don't ground it if it's inventing

6772
02:13:31,210 --> 02:13:33,140
 

6773
02:13:31,220 --> 02:13:34,790
 entire new types of languages with new

6774
02:13:33,130 --> 02:13:34,790
 

6775
02:13:33,140 --> 02:13:36,440
 types of linguistics and linguist could

6776
02:13:34,780 --> 02:13:36,440
 

6777
02:13:34,790 --> 02:13:38,510
 spend decades or millennia trying to

6778
02:13:36,430 --> 02:13:38,510
 

6779
02:13:36,440 --> 02:13:40,970
 kind of figure out the space of all

6780
02:13:38,500 --> 02:13:40,970
 

6781
02:13:38,510 --> 02:13:42,680
 possible languages mu8 learned that like

6782
02:13:40,960 --> 02:13:42,680
 

6783
02:13:40,970 --> 02:13:44,360
 all human languages share this type of

6784
02:13:42,670 --> 02:13:44,360
 

6785
02:13:42,680 --> 02:13:45,710
 structure but there's actually all these

6786
02:13:44,350 --> 02:13:45,710
 

6787
02:13:44,360 --> 02:13:47,510
 different structures to get invented

6788
02:13:45,700 --> 02:13:47,510
 

6789
02:13:45,710 --> 02:13:49,430
 when things have emergent communication

6790
02:13:47,500 --> 02:13:49,430
 

6791
02:13:47,510 --> 02:13:50,960
 on their own so grounding is essential

6792
02:13:49,420 --> 02:13:50,960
 

6793
02:13:49,430 --> 02:13:51,950
 if you want to interact but maybe not if

6794
02:13:50,950 --> 02:13:51,950
 

6795
02:13:50,960 --> 02:13:52,489
 you want to learn about the space of

6796
02:13:51,940 --> 02:13:52,489
 

6797
02:13:51,950 --> 02:13:54,200
 possibility

6798
02:13:52,479 --> 02:13:54,200
 

6799
02:13:52,489 --> 02:13:57,140
 but have you guys run into that sort of

6800
02:13:54,190 --> 02:13:57,140
 

6801
02:13:54,200 --> 02:13:59,390
 problem when trying to generate say

6802
02:13:57,130 --> 02:13:59,390
 

6803
02:13:57,140 --> 02:14:01,670
 these environments like obviously your

6804
02:13:59,380 --> 02:14:01,670
 

6805
02:13:59,390 --> 02:14:03,980
 guyses environments have to be grounded

6806
02:14:01,660 --> 02:14:03,980
 

6807
02:14:01,670 --> 02:14:04,550
 in something like the real world or

6808
02:14:03,970 --> 02:14:04,550
 

6809
02:14:03,980 --> 02:14:06,230
 something like that

6810
02:14:04,540 --> 02:14:06,230
 

6811
02:14:04,550 --> 02:14:07,790
 sure so to some extent because we use a

6812
02:14:06,220 --> 02:14:07,790
 

6813
02:14:06,230 --> 02:14:10,250
 physics simulator that's grants our

6814
02:14:07,780 --> 02:14:10,250
 

6815
02:14:07,790 --> 02:14:11,930
 physics you could also try to steer it

6816
02:14:10,240 --> 02:14:11,930
 

6817
02:14:10,250 --> 02:14:14,660
 if you want to towards particular types

6818
02:14:11,920 --> 02:14:14,660
 

6819
02:14:11,930 --> 02:14:16,610
 of problems so far we haven't run into

6820
02:14:14,650 --> 02:14:16,610
 

6821
02:14:14,660 --> 02:14:18,260
 the problem of grounding because in the

6822
02:14:16,600 --> 02:14:18,260
 

6823
02:14:16,610 --> 02:14:19,760
 cases where we have tried to use it for

6824
02:14:18,250 --> 02:14:19,760
 

6825
02:14:18,260 --> 02:14:21,230
 another problem downstream like in the

6826
02:14:19,750 --> 02:14:21,230
 

6827
02:14:19,760 --> 02:14:22,850
 nature intelligent trial and error paper

6828
02:14:21,220 --> 02:14:22,850
 

6829
02:14:21,230 --> 02:14:24,110
 we have had a robot in a physics

6830
02:14:22,840 --> 02:14:24,110
 

6831
02:14:22,850 --> 02:14:25,489
 simulator and that's close enough that

6832
02:14:24,100 --> 02:14:25,489
 

6833
02:14:24,110 --> 02:14:28,690
 we can harness the solutions it comes up

6834
02:14:25,479 --> 02:14:28,690
 

6835
02:14:25,489 --> 02:14:28,690
 with sure thanks

6836
02:14:30,310 --> 02:14:30,310
 

6837
02:14:30,320 --> 02:14:35,579
 actually one just watch it but it just

6838
02:14:32,959 --> 02:14:35,579
 

6839
02:14:32,969 --> 02:14:37,230
 is interesting to consider that that the

6840
02:14:35,569 --> 02:14:37,230
 

6841
02:14:35,579 --> 02:14:45,659
 evolution of language also is an

6842
02:14:37,220 --> 02:14:45,659
 

6843
02:14:37,230 --> 02:14:47,579
 open-ended process hi so I have a

6844
02:14:45,649 --> 02:14:47,579
 

6845
02:14:45,659 --> 02:14:50,570
 question regarding the scaling of your

6846
02:14:47,569 --> 02:14:50,570
 

6847
02:14:47,579 --> 02:14:53,190
 algorithms basically if you consider

6848
02:14:50,560 --> 02:14:53,190
 

6849
02:14:50,570 --> 02:14:56,039
 configuration space to be characterized

6850
02:14:53,180 --> 02:14:56,039
 

6851
02:14:53,190 --> 02:14:59,730
 by discrete set of variables there is

6852
02:14:56,029 --> 02:14:59,730
 

6853
02:14:56,039 --> 02:15:02,070
 the issue with NP hardness of that doing

6854
02:14:59,720 --> 02:15:02,070
 

6855
02:14:59,730 --> 02:15:07,409
 discrete optimization to sample from

6856
02:15:02,060 --> 02:15:07,409
 

6857
02:15:02,070 --> 02:15:14,670
 this quality diversity basically do you

6858
02:15:07,399 --> 02:15:14,670
 

6859
02:15:07,409 --> 02:15:17,610
 have any comments on this yeah the the

6860
02:15:14,660 --> 02:15:17,610
 

6861
02:15:14,670 --> 02:15:19,889
 dimensionality of the so we would call

6862
02:15:17,600 --> 02:15:19,889
 

6863
02:15:17,610 --> 02:15:21,119
 that what we're talking about the kinds

6864
02:15:19,879 --> 02:15:21,119
 

6865
02:15:19,889 --> 02:15:22,170
 of behaviors were searching through we

6866
02:15:21,109 --> 02:15:22,170
 

6867
02:15:21,119 --> 02:15:23,699
 might call it a behavior

6868
02:15:22,160 --> 02:15:23,699
 

6869
02:15:22,170 --> 02:15:26,130
 characterization like there's some

6870
02:15:23,689 --> 02:15:26,130
 

6871
02:15:23,699 --> 02:15:29,070
 vector that characterizes the behavior

6872
02:15:26,120 --> 02:15:29,070
 

6873
02:15:26,130 --> 02:15:31,020
 space and that has some number of

6874
02:15:29,060 --> 02:15:31,020
 

6875
02:15:29,070 --> 02:15:34,409
 variables or some dimensionality that

6876
02:15:31,010 --> 02:15:34,409
 

6877
02:15:31,020 --> 02:15:35,699
 describes that space and the

6878
02:15:34,399 --> 02:15:35,699
 

6879
02:15:34,409 --> 02:15:38,369
 dimensionality of the behavior

6880
02:15:35,689 --> 02:15:38,369
 

6881
02:15:35,699 --> 02:15:41,400
 characterization does interact with the

6882
02:15:38,359 --> 02:15:41,400
 

6883
02:15:38,369 --> 02:15:42,719
 search in some way but one thing to

6884
02:15:41,390 --> 02:15:42,719
 

6885
02:15:41,400 --> 02:15:44,610
 consider just just when thinking about

6886
02:15:42,709 --> 02:15:44,610
 

6887
02:15:42,719 --> 02:15:45,630
 this is that the dimensionality of the

6888
02:15:44,600 --> 02:15:45,630
 

6889
02:15:44,610 --> 02:15:46,829
 behavior characterization is not

6890
02:15:45,620 --> 02:15:46,829
 

6891
02:15:45,630 --> 02:15:49,260
 necessarily the same as the

6892
02:15:46,819 --> 02:15:49,260
 

6893
02:15:46,829 --> 02:15:51,570
 dimensionality of the of the search

6894
02:15:49,250 --> 02:15:51,570
 

6895
02:15:49,260 --> 02:15:53,520
 itself because the search is happening

6896
02:15:51,560 --> 02:15:53,520
 

6897
02:15:51,570 --> 02:15:55,199
 inside of whatever your representation

6898
02:15:53,510 --> 02:15:55,199
 

6899
02:15:53,520 --> 02:15:55,710
 is so for example like if it's neural

6900
02:15:55,189 --> 02:15:55,710
 

6901
02:15:55,199 --> 02:15:57,179
 networks

6902
02:15:55,700 --> 02:15:57,179
 

6903
02:15:55,710 --> 02:15:58,530
 it's the dimensionality of the neural

6904
02:15:57,169 --> 02:15:58,530
 

6905
02:15:57,179 --> 02:15:59,880
 networks that defines the search space

6906
02:15:58,520 --> 02:15:59,880
 

6907
02:15:58,530 --> 02:16:01,469
 that you're searching through the

6908
02:15:59,870 --> 02:16:01,469
 

6909
02:15:59,880 --> 02:16:03,570
 demented behavior characterization is

6910
02:16:01,459 --> 02:16:03,570
 

6911
02:16:01,469 --> 02:16:05,699
 actually not the search space so you can

6912
02:16:03,560 --> 02:16:05,699
 

6913
02:16:03,570 --> 02:16:07,920
 have some some interaction effects that

6914
02:16:05,689 --> 02:16:07,920
 

6915
02:16:05,699 --> 02:16:09,170
 are counterintuitive there because you

6916
02:16:07,910 --> 02:16:09,170
 

6917
02:16:07,920 --> 02:16:11,309
 can have very high dimensional

6918
02:16:09,160 --> 02:16:11,309
 

6919
02:16:09,170 --> 02:16:13,500
 characterization spaces where it

6920
02:16:11,299 --> 02:16:13,500
 

6921
02:16:11,309 --> 02:16:14,550
 actually optimizes very easily because

6922
02:16:13,490 --> 02:16:14,550
 

6923
02:16:13,500 --> 02:16:18,420
 actually a low dimensional optimization

6924
02:16:14,540 --> 02:16:18,420
 

6925
02:16:14,550 --> 02:16:20,670
 space however having said that of course

6926
02:16:18,410 --> 02:16:20,670
 

6927
02:16:18,420 --> 02:16:23,309
 if the if the behavior characterization

6928
02:16:20,660 --> 02:16:23,309
 

6929
02:16:20,670 --> 02:16:24,719
 is extremely high dimensional then you

6930
02:16:23,299 --> 02:16:24,719
 

6931
02:16:23,309 --> 02:16:28,500
 do probably have to do something to

6932
02:16:24,709 --> 02:16:28,500
 

6933
02:16:24,719 --> 02:16:30,510
 accommodate that and there are different

6934
02:16:28,490 --> 02:16:30,510
 

6935
02:16:28,500 --> 02:16:31,829
 quality diversity algorithms that are

6936
02:16:30,500 --> 02:16:31,829
 

6937
02:16:30,510 --> 02:16:34,139
 probably more well suited to low

6938
02:16:31,819 --> 02:16:34,139
 

6939
02:16:31,829 --> 02:16:37,019
 dimensional versus high dimensional and

6940
02:16:34,129 --> 02:16:37,019
 

6941
02:16:34,139 --> 02:16:39,210
 so when you're discretizing that could

6942
02:16:37,009 --> 02:16:39,210
 

6943
02:16:37,019 --> 02:16:41,429
 be probably more suited to to a lower

6944
02:16:39,200 --> 02:16:41,429
 

6945
02:16:39,210 --> 02:16:41,740
 dimensional but there are QT algorithms

6946
02:16:41,419 --> 02:16:41,740
 

6947
02:16:41,429 --> 02:16:43,750
 like

6948
02:16:41,730 --> 02:16:43,750
 

6949
02:16:41,740 --> 02:16:45,400
 we'll see that are more not disparate i

6950
02:16:43,740 --> 02:16:45,400
 

6951
02:16:43,750 --> 02:16:47,290
 trying to discretize the behavior space

6952
02:16:45,390 --> 02:16:47,290
 

6953
02:16:45,400 --> 02:16:48,580
 which are more serious perhaps to a

6954
02:16:47,280 --> 02:16:48,580
 

6955
02:16:47,290 --> 02:16:51,640
 higher dimensional type of behavior

6956
02:16:48,570 --> 02:16:51,640
 

6957
02:16:48,580 --> 02:16:54,460
 characterization but ultimately there

6958
02:16:51,630 --> 02:16:54,460
 

6959
02:16:51,640 --> 02:16:56,500
 will be challenges with extremely high

6960
02:16:54,450 --> 02:16:56,500
 

6961
02:16:54,460 --> 02:16:58,090
 of course extremely high like your

6962
02:16:56,490 --> 02:16:58,090
 

6963
02:16:56,500 --> 02:16:59,830
 entire life or something trying to put

6964
02:16:58,080 --> 02:16:59,830
 

6965
02:16:58,090 --> 02:17:01,870
 that into a vector and compare you to

6966
02:16:59,820 --> 02:17:01,870
 

6967
02:16:59,830 --> 02:17:03,910
 somewhere someone else that can be a

6968
02:17:01,860 --> 02:17:03,910
 

6969
02:17:01,870 --> 02:17:05,650
 problem that and it's a challenge and so

6970
02:17:03,900 --> 02:17:05,650
 

6971
02:17:03,910 --> 02:17:07,180
 what we really would like to do is deal

6972
02:17:05,640 --> 02:17:07,180
 

6973
02:17:05,650 --> 02:17:08,230
 with which is a general reinforcement

6974
02:17:07,170 --> 02:17:08,230
 

6975
02:17:07,180 --> 02:17:10,600
 learning problem I think which is

6976
02:17:08,220 --> 02:17:10,600
 

6977
02:17:08,230 --> 02:17:12,790
 learning good representations of the

6978
02:17:10,590 --> 02:17:12,790
 

6979
02:17:10,600 --> 02:17:14,050
 space ultimately like to learn the

6980
02:17:12,780 --> 02:17:14,050
 

6981
02:17:12,790 --> 02:17:16,630
 behavior characterization so that we

6982
02:17:14,040 --> 02:17:16,630
 

6983
02:17:14,050 --> 02:17:18,310
 extract the salient aspects of it even

6984
02:17:16,620 --> 02:17:18,310
 

6985
02:17:16,630 --> 02:17:19,510
 as we're searching through it which i

6986
02:17:18,300 --> 02:17:19,510
 

6987
02:17:18,310 --> 02:17:21,460
 think is ultimately what's really

6988
02:17:19,500 --> 02:17:21,460
 

6989
02:17:19,510 --> 02:17:23,440
 interesting and then we could search and

6990
02:17:21,450 --> 02:17:23,440
 

6991
02:17:21,460 --> 02:17:25,150
 continually refine our understanding of

6992
02:17:23,430 --> 02:17:25,150
 

6993
02:17:23,440 --> 02:17:27,580
 what that space is maybe Jeff has

6994
02:17:25,140 --> 02:17:27,580
 

6995
02:17:25,150 --> 02:17:31,030
 something to add I just think it's one

6996
02:17:27,570 --> 02:17:31,030
 

6997
02:17:27,580 --> 02:17:32,710
 of the most kind of profound and fun

6998
02:17:31,020 --> 02:17:32,710
 

6999
02:17:31,030 --> 02:17:35,410
 insights of all of machine learning is

7000
02:17:32,700 --> 02:17:35,410
 

7001
02:17:32,710 --> 02:17:37,600
 that the set of interesting things is

7002
02:17:35,400 --> 02:17:37,600
 

7003
02:17:35,410 --> 02:17:39,190
 afar very like a small low dimensional

7004
02:17:37,590 --> 02:17:39,190
 

7005
02:17:37,600 --> 02:17:41,020
 manifold within the higher dimensional

7006
02:17:39,180 --> 02:17:41,020
 

7007
02:17:39,190 --> 02:17:42,910
 space and you know when we're trying to

7008
02:17:41,010 --> 02:17:42,910
 

7009
02:17:41,020 --> 02:17:45,520
 generate architectures and learning

7010
02:17:42,900 --> 02:17:45,520
 

7011
02:17:42,910 --> 02:17:47,500
 algorithms and interesting environments

7012
02:17:45,510 --> 02:17:47,500
 

7013
02:17:45,520 --> 02:17:48,880
 if we can figure out how to recognize

7014
02:17:47,490 --> 02:17:48,880
 

7015
02:17:47,500 --> 02:17:50,830
 what's interesting and we'll traverse

7016
02:17:48,870 --> 02:17:50,830
 

7017
02:17:48,880 --> 02:17:51,790
 and search that space then we don't have

7018
02:17:50,820 --> 02:17:51,790
 

7019
02:17:50,830 --> 02:17:52,600
 this problem this curse of

7020
02:17:51,780 --> 02:17:52,600
 

7021
02:17:51,790 --> 02:17:54,070
 dimensionality

7022
02:17:52,590 --> 02:17:54,070
 

7023
02:17:52,600 --> 02:17:56,380
 of like you know the space of all

7024
02:17:54,060 --> 02:17:56,380
 

7025
02:17:54,070 --> 02:17:57,610
 possible pixels or whatever it is and so

7026
02:17:56,370 --> 02:17:57,610
 

7027
02:17:56,380 --> 02:17:59,110
 I think that's kind of one of the grand

7028
02:17:57,600 --> 02:17:59,110
 

7029
02:17:57,610 --> 02:18:00,520
 you know one of the major challenges in

7030
02:17:59,100 --> 02:18:00,520
 

7031
02:17:59,110 --> 02:18:02,560
 this field is how do you define what's

7032
02:18:00,510 --> 02:18:02,560
 

7033
02:18:00,520 --> 02:18:04,480
 interesting and so you spend time and

7034
02:18:02,550 --> 02:18:04,480
 

7035
02:18:02,560 --> 02:18:07,240
 computation exploring what's interesting

7036
02:18:04,470 --> 02:18:07,240
 

7037
02:18:04,480 --> 02:18:13,600
 as opposed to what's uninteresting thank

7038
02:18:07,230 --> 02:18:13,600
 

7039
02:18:07,240 --> 02:18:17,350
 you I think wondering is the open-ended

7040
02:18:13,590 --> 02:18:17,350
 

7041
02:18:13,600 --> 02:18:26,440
 concept fucking's do ya know free lunch

7042
02:18:17,340 --> 02:18:26,440
 

7043
02:18:17,350 --> 02:18:31,510
 theorem okay yes so is open endedness a

7044
02:18:26,430 --> 02:18:31,510
 

7045
02:18:26,440 --> 02:18:33,610
 violation of no free lunch and I think

7046
02:18:31,500 --> 02:18:33,610
 

7047
02:18:31,510 --> 02:18:35,950
 open endedness is orthogonal to no free

7048
02:18:33,600 --> 02:18:35,950
 

7049
02:18:33,610 --> 02:18:39,820
 lunch because no free lunch is about the

7050
02:18:35,940 --> 02:18:39,820
 

7051
02:18:35,950 --> 02:18:40,980
 idea that there is no for any if we have

7052
02:18:39,810 --> 02:18:40,980
 

7053
02:18:39,820 --> 02:18:43,210
 look at the space of all possible

7054
02:18:40,970 --> 02:18:43,210
 

7055
02:18:40,980 --> 02:18:45,100
 optimization problems and there is no

7056
02:18:43,200 --> 02:18:45,100
 

7057
02:18:43,210 --> 02:18:47,140
 single algorithm which is the best

7058
02:18:45,090 --> 02:18:47,140
 

7059
02:18:45,100 --> 02:18:48,700
 suited for all of them but what's

7060
02:18:47,130 --> 02:18:48,700
 

7061
02:18:47,140 --> 02:18:51,260
 interesting here is that an open

7062
02:18:48,690 --> 02:18:51,260
 

7063
02:18:48,700 --> 02:18:53,389
 endedness were not actual

7064
02:18:51,250 --> 02:18:53,389
 

7065
02:18:51,260 --> 02:18:55,429
 talking about an optimization problem

7066
02:18:53,379 --> 02:18:55,429
 

7067
02:18:53,389 --> 02:18:56,840
 because there's not a particular problem

7068
02:18:55,419 --> 02:18:56,840
 

7069
02:18:55,429 --> 02:18:58,399
 that we're trying to solve rather we're

7070
02:18:56,830 --> 02:18:58,399
 

7071
02:18:56,840 --> 02:18:59,990
 trying we're inventing problems and

7072
02:18:58,389 --> 02:18:59,990
 

7073
02:18:58,399 --> 02:19:01,550
 solving them at all times

7074
02:18:59,980 --> 02:19:01,550
 

7075
02:18:59,990 --> 02:19:05,660
 and there's not anything specifically

7076
02:19:01,540 --> 02:19:05,660
 

7077
02:19:01,550 --> 02:19:08,689
 that we're trying to solve so to to try

7078
02:19:05,650 --> 02:19:08,689
 

7079
02:19:05,660 --> 02:19:11,420
 to contort no free lunch to actually

7080
02:19:08,679 --> 02:19:11,420
 

7081
02:19:08,689 --> 02:19:13,399
 analyze that kind of a structure it

7082
02:19:11,410 --> 02:19:13,399
 

7083
02:19:11,420 --> 02:19:15,469
 would be like a whole step beyond the

7084
02:19:13,389 --> 02:19:15,469
 

7085
02:19:13,399 --> 02:19:17,330
 current framework for no free lunch like

7086
02:19:15,459 --> 02:19:17,330
 

7087
02:19:15,469 --> 02:19:18,859
 you might say well what is what does it

7088
02:19:17,320 --> 02:19:18,859
 

7089
02:19:17,330 --> 02:19:20,719
 mean to be successful when you're

7090
02:19:18,849 --> 02:19:20,719
 

7091
02:19:18,859 --> 02:19:22,819
 open-ended I mean have to start there

7092
02:19:20,709 --> 02:19:22,819
 

7093
02:19:20,719 --> 02:19:24,229
 and then given this criteria for success

7094
02:19:22,809 --> 02:19:24,229
 

7095
02:19:22,819 --> 02:19:26,029
 is there such a thing as a best

7096
02:19:24,219 --> 02:19:26,029
 

7097
02:19:24,229 --> 02:19:27,410
 open-ended algorithm but that's a

7098
02:19:26,019 --> 02:19:27,410
 

7099
02:19:26,029 --> 02:19:28,700
 different question from what no free

7100
02:19:27,400 --> 02:19:28,700
 

7101
02:19:27,410 --> 02:19:30,649
 lunch is addressing right now which is

7102
02:19:28,690 --> 02:19:30,649
 

7103
02:19:28,700 --> 02:19:33,080
 given a problem what is the best

7104
02:19:30,639 --> 02:19:33,080
 

7105
02:19:30,649 --> 02:19:35,300
 algorithm for finding a solution in fact

7106
02:19:33,070 --> 02:19:35,300
 

7107
02:19:33,080 --> 02:19:37,399
 I think this is anecdotal but it's

7108
02:19:35,290 --> 02:19:37,399
 

7109
02:19:35,300 --> 02:19:38,479
 interesting so this is this I could be

7110
02:19:37,389 --> 02:19:38,479
 

7111
02:19:37,399 --> 02:19:40,580
 distorting the slope because it's my

7112
02:19:38,469 --> 02:19:40,580
 

7113
02:19:38,479 --> 02:19:42,679
 understanding of a story second hand but

7114
02:19:40,570 --> 02:19:42,679
 

7115
02:19:40,580 --> 02:19:44,929
 I think that when when no free lunch

7116
02:19:42,669 --> 02:19:44,929
 

7117
02:19:42,679 --> 02:19:47,260
 first came out and this is I don't know

7118
02:19:44,919 --> 02:19:47,260
 

7119
02:19:44,929 --> 02:19:50,510
 if this is widely known that actually

7120
02:19:47,250 --> 02:19:50,510
 

7121
02:19:47,260 --> 02:19:52,250
 some people who were anti evolution like

7122
02:19:50,500 --> 02:19:52,250
 

7123
02:19:50,510 --> 02:19:54,350
 creation is actually latched on to no

7124
02:19:52,240 --> 02:19:54,350
 

7125
02:19:52,250 --> 02:19:56,270
 free lunch and said it made a similar

7126
02:19:54,340 --> 02:19:56,270
 

7127
02:19:54,350 --> 02:19:57,859
 question like well does doesn't this

7128
02:19:56,260 --> 02:19:57,859
 

7129
02:19:56,270 --> 02:20:00,740
 help us to see that this couldn't have

7130
02:19:57,849 --> 02:20:00,740
 

7131
02:19:57,859 --> 02:20:03,260
 actually happened and the that was

7132
02:20:00,730 --> 02:20:03,260
 

7133
02:20:00,740 --> 02:20:05,330
 interesting because David Wolper who

7134
02:20:03,250 --> 02:20:05,330
 

7135
02:20:03,260 --> 02:20:08,630
 actually was one of the inventors of the

7136
02:20:05,320 --> 02:20:08,630
 

7137
02:20:05,330 --> 02:20:10,760
 know free lunch theorem said actually

7138
02:20:08,620 --> 02:20:10,760
 

7139
02:20:08,630 --> 02:20:12,319
 had to react to this and said that

7140
02:20:10,750 --> 02:20:12,319
 

7141
02:20:10,760 --> 02:20:13,819
 actually there are co-evolutionary

7142
02:20:12,309 --> 02:20:13,819
 

7143
02:20:12,319 --> 02:20:16,430
 exceptions to no free lunch if you

7144
02:20:13,809 --> 02:20:16,430
 

7145
02:20:13,819 --> 02:20:18,560
 understand which can explain why certain

7146
02:20:16,420 --> 02:20:18,560
 

7147
02:20:16,430 --> 02:20:21,109
 types of self self playing systems like

7148
02:20:18,550 --> 02:20:21,109
 

7149
02:20:18,560 --> 02:20:23,330
 evolution basically shouldn't be judged

7150
02:20:21,099 --> 02:20:23,330
 

7151
02:20:21,109 --> 02:20:25,100
 in the context of the lens of the no

7152
02:20:23,320 --> 02:20:25,100
 

7153
02:20:23,330 --> 02:20:26,600
 free lunch algorithm so even though the

7154
02:20:25,090 --> 02:20:26,600
 

7155
02:20:25,100 --> 02:20:28,069
 inventor of no free lunch had to

7156
02:20:26,590 --> 02:20:28,069
 

7157
02:20:26,600 --> 02:20:29,779
 confront the question like this and sort

7158
02:20:28,059 --> 02:20:29,779
 

7159
02:20:28,069 --> 02:20:31,040
 of said no no that's the wrong way of

7160
02:20:29,769 --> 02:20:31,040
 

7161
02:20:29,779 --> 02:20:34,450
 thinking about no free lunch it should

7162
02:20:31,030 --> 02:20:34,450
 

7163
02:20:31,040 --> 02:20:34,450
 not be applied in that context

7164
02:20:38,080 --> 02:20:38,080
 

7165
02:20:38,090 --> 02:20:43,609
 hi my name is Nathan thank you for this

7166
02:20:40,990 --> 02:20:43,609
 

7167
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:45,560
 wonderful talk and while trying to

7168
02:20:43,599 --> 02:20:45,560
 

7169
02:20:43,609 --> 02:20:47,810
 capture certain aspects or different

7170
02:20:45,550 --> 02:20:47,810
 

7171
02:20:45,560 --> 02:20:50,359
 concepts like gold switching or

7172
02:20:47,800 --> 02:20:50,359
 

7173
02:20:47,810 --> 02:20:53,300
 open-endedness a population diversity

7174
02:20:50,349 --> 02:20:53,300
 

7175
02:20:50,359 --> 02:20:55,939
 and the generation of new environments

7176
02:20:53,290 --> 02:20:55,939
 

7177
02:20:53,300 --> 02:20:59,329
 it kind of got me thinking about human

7178
02:20:55,929 --> 02:20:59,329
 

7179
02:20:55,939 --> 02:21:01,550
 migration where the main intrinsic

7180
02:20:59,319 --> 02:21:01,550
 

7181
02:20:59,329 --> 02:21:03,290
 objective of a group of humans was to

7182
02:21:01,540 --> 02:21:03,290
 

7183
02:21:01,550 --> 02:21:06,050
 find sustenance and resources in a

7184
02:21:03,280 --> 02:21:06,050
 

7185
02:21:03,290 --> 02:21:08,449
 certain location and thrive there but as

7186
02:21:06,040 --> 02:21:08,449
 

7187
02:21:06,050 --> 02:21:11,390
 an extrinsic behavior it was also about

7188
02:21:08,439 --> 02:21:11,390
 

7189
02:21:08,449 --> 02:21:13,340
 exploring new areas where they'll have

7190
02:21:11,380 --> 02:21:13,340
 

7191
02:21:11,390 --> 02:21:14,960
 more resources or going to a different

7192
02:21:13,330 --> 02:21:14,960
 

7193
02:21:13,340 --> 02:21:18,739
 location due to constraints like weather

7194
02:21:14,950 --> 02:21:18,739
 

7195
02:21:14,960 --> 02:21:21,890
 so I was wondering if population

7196
02:21:18,729 --> 02:21:21,890
 

7197
02:21:18,739 --> 02:21:24,560
 dynamics can also play in as a factor in

7198
02:21:21,880 --> 02:21:24,560
 

7199
02:21:21,890 --> 02:21:27,729
 the training process instead of just

7200
02:21:24,550 --> 02:21:27,729
 

7201
02:21:24,560 --> 02:21:30,229
 having a comparison between

7202
02:21:27,719 --> 02:21:30,229
 

7203
02:21:27,729 --> 02:21:31,699
 objective based training and novelty

7204
02:21:30,219 --> 02:21:31,699
 

7205
02:21:30,229 --> 02:21:33,350
 based training maybe we can have

7206
02:21:31,689 --> 02:21:33,350
 

7207
02:21:31,699 --> 02:21:35,960
 something like a group of multiple

7208
02:21:33,340 --> 02:21:35,960
 

7209
02:21:33,350 --> 02:21:38,479
 agents where intrinsically they're all

7210
02:21:35,950 --> 02:21:38,479
 

7211
02:21:35,960 --> 02:21:40,819
 objective based but as a group or as a

7212
02:21:38,469 --> 02:21:40,819
 

7213
02:21:38,479 --> 02:21:43,489
 collective you can also have coevolution

7214
02:21:40,809 --> 02:21:43,489
 

7215
02:21:40,819 --> 02:21:46,250
 our adversarial groups that are

7216
02:21:43,479 --> 02:21:46,250
 

7217
02:21:43,489 --> 02:21:49,010
 exploring in the same state space do you

7218
02:21:46,240 --> 02:21:49,010
 

7219
02:21:46,250 --> 02:21:52,069
 think that would have more implications

7220
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:52,069
 

7221
02:21:49,010 --> 02:21:55,790
 towards AGI or would there be some sort

7222
02:21:52,059 --> 02:21:55,790
 

7223
02:21:52,069 --> 02:21:56,989
 of a trade off yeah so I think that is a

7224
02:21:55,780 --> 02:21:56,989
 

7225
02:21:55,790 --> 02:21:58,699
 fascinating question I think that

7226
02:21:56,979 --> 02:21:58,699
 

7227
02:21:56,989 --> 02:22:00,949
 ultimately if we want to produce agents

7228
02:21:58,689 --> 02:22:00,949
 

7229
02:21:58,699 --> 02:22:02,270
 that have general AI they're gonna have

7230
02:22:00,939 --> 02:22:02,270
 

7231
02:22:00,949 --> 02:22:03,680
 to interact with other agents because

7232
02:22:02,260 --> 02:22:03,680
 

7233
02:22:02,270 --> 02:22:06,470
 part of the problem is communicating

7234
02:22:03,670 --> 02:22:06,470
 

7235
02:22:03,680 --> 02:22:08,149
 with other agents and learning how to be

7236
02:22:06,460 --> 02:22:08,149
 

7237
02:22:06,470 --> 02:22:09,829
 cooperative and you know resist

7238
02:22:08,139 --> 02:22:09,829
 

7239
02:22:08,149 --> 02:22:12,489
 adversaries and this and that and that's

7240
02:22:09,819 --> 02:22:12,489
 

7241
02:22:09,829 --> 02:22:14,750
 part of the challenge of course and so

7242
02:22:12,479 --> 02:22:14,750
 

7243
02:22:12,489 --> 02:22:16,520
 inside of these generated environments

7244
02:22:14,740 --> 02:22:16,520
 

7245
02:22:14,750 --> 02:22:17,810
 you need other agents and there's many

7246
02:22:16,510 --> 02:22:17,810
 

7247
02:22:16,520 --> 02:22:19,609
 different ways to do that and I could

7248
02:22:17,800 --> 02:22:19,609
 

7249
02:22:17,810 --> 02:22:21,140
 speculate them and I have I won't go

7250
02:22:19,599 --> 02:22:21,140
 

7251
02:22:19,609 --> 02:22:22,670
 into that here it's suffice it to say

7252
02:22:21,130 --> 02:22:22,670
 

7253
02:22:21,140 --> 02:22:25,279
 that this is a kind of a wide open area

7254
02:22:22,660 --> 02:22:25,279
 

7255
02:22:22,670 --> 02:22:26,989
 for creative opportunity for the people

7256
02:22:25,269 --> 02:22:26,989
 

7257
02:22:25,279 --> 02:22:28,670
 in this room in this community to think

7258
02:22:26,979 --> 02:22:28,670
 

7259
02:22:26,989 --> 02:22:30,680
 about what's the best way to get the

7260
02:22:28,660 --> 02:22:30,680
 

7261
02:22:28,670 --> 02:22:33,710
 dynamics that kind of created these

7262
02:22:30,670 --> 02:22:33,710
 

7263
02:22:30,680 --> 02:22:35,869
 co-evolutionary opportunities in history

7264
02:22:33,700 --> 02:22:35,869
 

7265
02:22:33,710 --> 02:22:37,520
 and in nature to do healthy things for

7266
02:22:35,859 --> 02:22:37,520
 

7267
02:22:35,869 --> 02:22:38,750
 us in our algorithms sometimes you know

7268
02:22:37,510 --> 02:22:38,750
 

7269
02:22:37,520 --> 02:22:41,000
 some people are on to believe that you

7270
02:22:38,740 --> 02:22:41,000
 

7271
02:22:38,750 --> 02:22:42,020
 need some of these effects and some

7272
02:22:40,990 --> 02:22:42,020
 

7273
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,790
 people might think that you could get

7274
02:22:42,010 --> 02:22:43,790
 

7275
02:22:42,020 --> 02:22:44,930
 away without them and I don't even

7276
02:22:43,780 --> 02:22:44,930
 

7277
02:22:43,790 --> 02:22:46,489
 really think I want to take a position

7278
02:22:44,920 --> 02:22:46,489
 

7279
02:22:44,930 --> 02:22:48,229
 because I think we're better off as a

7280
02:22:46,479 --> 02:22:48,229
 

7281
02:22:46,489 --> 02:22:49,939
 community when we all kind of go and

7282
02:22:48,219 --> 02:22:49,939
 

7283
02:22:48,229 --> 02:22:50,840
 pursue our own beliefs for how to

7284
02:22:49,929 --> 02:22:50,840
 

7285
02:22:49,939 --> 02:22:54,830
 accomplish

7286
02:22:50,830 --> 02:22:54,830
 

7287
02:22:50,840 --> 02:22:56,960
 and just one other quick thing to add is

7288
02:22:54,820 --> 02:22:56,960
 

7289
02:22:54,830 --> 02:22:58,850
 some people have said which is sort of

7290
02:22:56,950 --> 02:22:58,850
 

7291
02:22:56,960 --> 02:23:00,920
 interesting to think about that the more

7292
02:22:58,840 --> 02:23:00,920
 

7293
02:22:58,850 --> 02:23:02,660
 objectives you have the less you have an

7294
02:23:00,910 --> 02:23:02,660
 

7295
02:23:00,920 --> 02:23:03,770
 objective so you can kind of think about

7296
02:23:02,650 --> 02:23:03,770
 

7297
02:23:02,660 --> 02:23:05,090
 that like if you have millions and

7298
02:23:03,760 --> 02:23:05,090
 

7299
02:23:03,770 --> 02:23:06,050
 millions of objectives you imagine

7300
02:23:05,080 --> 02:23:06,050
 

7301
02:23:05,090 --> 02:23:08,180
 millions of people with different

7302
02:23:06,040 --> 02:23:08,180
 

7303
02:23:06,050 --> 02:23:13,390
 objectives the whole system in aggregate

7304
02:23:08,170 --> 02:23:13,390
 

7305
02:23:08,180 --> 02:23:15,740
 starts to be less objective okay

7306
02:23:13,380 --> 02:23:15,740
 

7307
02:23:13,390 --> 02:23:17,450
 Riya has asked us to take the rest of

7308
02:23:15,730 --> 02:23:17,450
 

7309
02:23:15,740 --> 02:23:18,710
 the questions offline so we will be up

7310
02:23:17,440 --> 02:23:18,710
 

7311
02:23:17,450 --> 02:23:20,660
 here and I'm happy to answer any

7312
02:23:18,700 --> 02:23:20,660
 

7313
02:23:18,710 --> 02:23:23,450
 questions that you have I in particular

7314
02:23:20,650 --> 02:23:23,450
 

7315
02:23:20,660 --> 02:23:25,189
 want to again think the ICML we're going

7316
02:23:23,440 --> 02:23:25,189
 

7317
02:23:23,450 --> 02:23:26,689
 to including Riya for the one deliver an

7318
02:23:25,179 --> 02:23:26,689
 

7319
02:23:25,189 --> 02:23:27,859
 invitation and for all of you for

7320
02:23:26,679 --> 02:23:27,859
 

7321
02:23:26,689 --> 02:23:29,210
 sticking around and interesting think

7322
02:23:27,849 --> 02:23:29,210
 

7323
02:23:27,859 --> 02:23:31,450
 it's been a lovely and interesting

7324
02:23:29,200 --> 02:23:31,450
 

7325
02:23:29,210 --> 02:23:31,450
 conversation

7326
02:23:36,830 --> 02:23:36,830
 

7327
02:23:36,840 --> 02:23:38,899
