47
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,239
 about um

48
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:56,239
 

49
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,760
 and this is in a nutshell different uh

50
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:57,760
 

51
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,960
 different aspects around

52
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,960
 

53
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,039
 mirror agility um but in essence these

54
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,039
 

55
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,920
 are the five different topics i would

56
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:03,920
 

57
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,439
 like to cover

58
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,439
 

59
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,119
 for this afternoon so we're going to

60
00:01:05,429 --> 00:01:07,119
 

61
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,920
 start with

62
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:09,920
 

63
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:12,000
 um a concept or we're going to be

64
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:12,000
 

65
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,520
 talking about sustaining change we're

66
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,520
 

67
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,040
 going to be talking about learning

68
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,040
 

69
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,560
 organizations

70
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,560
 

71
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,400
 of course you might be curious about

72
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,400
 

73
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,320
 what is this about your agility we're

74
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,320
 

75
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,400
 going to be talking about that

76
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,400
 

77
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,439
 um we're going to be exploring some of

78
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,439
 

79
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,640
 the

80
00:01:23,429 --> 00:01:26,640
 

81
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:29,840
 factors that um agility study just

82
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,840
 

83
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,840
 to talk about learning only

84
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,840
 

85
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,280
 not only for individuals but also for

86
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,280
 

87
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,880
 organizations

88
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,880
 

89
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,439
 and last but not least we're going to

90
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,439
 

91
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:41,840
 have a group activity that hopefully we

92
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:41,840
 

93
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,840
 will be able to run with all of you

94
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:43,910
 

95
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,000
 savita so the word today is rapidly

96
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,000
 

97
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,119
 changing

98
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:51,119
 

99
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,560
 and we know that some of us called it a

100
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:52,560
 

101
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,880
 disruptive word

102
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,880
 

103
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,960
 due to today's market competition many

104
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,960
 

105
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,600
 organizations have been forced

106
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,600
 

107
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,000
 to go through a business transformation

108
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:02,000
 

109
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:06,079
 or technical transformation

110
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:06,079
 

111
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,079
 and we keep on

112
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:06,230
 

113
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,840
 i think i see my

114
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:12,390
 

115
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,280
 is it better now

116
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:18,949
 

117
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,560
 i think time to time we get that echo

118
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,560
 

119
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,560
 i closed my hop-in application so it

120
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,560
 

121
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,879
 should be good

122
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,879
 

123
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,720
 so i was talking about the rapidly

124
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:30,720
 

125
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,680
 changing and disruptive world

126
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,680
 

127
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,480
 um so we know that many organizations

128
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,480
 

129
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,480
 are going through

130
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,480
 

131
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,080
 agile transformation or business

132
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,080
 

133
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,360
 transformation or technical

134
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,360
 

135
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,599
 transformation

136
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,599
 

137
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,720
 and it's too much for the employees to

138
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:42,720
 

139
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,000
 keep up their

140
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:46,000
 

141
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,440
 skills as per the need so increasing the

142
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,440
 

143
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,400
 agile brain power of

144
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,400
 

145
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,959
 every individual leader and team will

146
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:50,959
 

147
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,319
 help us

148
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:54,319
 

149
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:57,920
 reduce the cost of change and enable us

150
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:57,920
 

151
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,920
 to think and learn faster

152
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:01,509
 

153
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,840
 go to the next slide

154
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:07,190
 

155
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,640
 so the challenge of having this

156
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,640
 

157
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,120
 disruptive change

158
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,120
 

159
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,640
 uh is the lack of skills to cope with

160
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,640
 

161
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,720
 information overload

162
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:18,720
 

163
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:21,040
 so the first point we we get the echo

164
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:21,040
 

165
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,040
 again

166
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:22,869
 

167
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,920
 for some reason

168
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:28,070
 

169
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,440
 i'm not getting any echo i haven't the

170
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,440
 

171
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,720
 entire session so far

172
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,720
 

173
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,480
 so it might be localized to certain

174
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,480
 

175
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,200
 listeners okay

176
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:37,200
 

177
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,599
 so maybe you should also log out from

178
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,599
 

179
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,599
 open

180
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:44,830
 

181
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,560
 sure

182
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,560
 

183
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,640
 okay so uh the first point around this

184
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,640
 

185
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,840
 uh challenge of having the disruptive

186
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,840
 

187
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,959
 change is the

188
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:56,959
 

189
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,200
 technology is changing in a fast speed

190
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:59,200
 

191
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,159
 and we are exposed to too much of data

192
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,159
 

193
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,720
 every day

194
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:02,720
 

195
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,360
 as you know that we have so many digital

196
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,360
 

197
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,799

198
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:06,799

 um instagram and from all over these

202
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,159
 

203
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,640
 digital channels we keep on getting a

204
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:14,640
 

205
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:17,280
 lot of data

206

 a single weekly edition of the new york

00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,239
 

209
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,320
 times contains

210
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:20,320
 

211
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,639
 more information than a person would

212
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,639
 

213
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,080
 have been exposed in a lifetime during

214
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:24,080
 

215
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,320
 the 17th century

216
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,320
 

217
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,199
 this is this is the start as per the

218
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,199
 

219
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,199
 research

220
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:29,199
 

221
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,280
 so we are dealing with too much of data

222
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:31,280
 

223
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,880
 these days

224
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:34,880
 

225
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,240
 the next thing is that an estimated 75

226
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,240
 

227
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,880
 to 90 percent of

228
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,880
 

229
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,240
 all illnesses as per the medical

230
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,240
 

231
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,360
 research

232
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:43,360
 

233
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,680
 has its origin in chronic stress so

234
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,680
 

235
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,360
 information overload is quickly become

236
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,360
 

237
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,560
 one of the greatest sources of

238
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:50,560
 

239
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,680
 stress and we also talk about

240
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:53,680
 

241
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,160
 nowadays whatever we learn 90

242
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,160
 

243
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,479
 of that we forget in a week as per

244
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,479
 

245
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,479
 research so we have to reinforce or

246
00:04:58,469 --> 00:05:00,479
 

247
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:03,280
 remember again

248
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:03,280
 

249
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,039
 and the biggest reason particularly why

250
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,039
 

251
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,479
 we are working from home

252
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:08,479
 

253
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:11,759
 is multitasking as well

254
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:11,759
 

255
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,639
 another thing is that um as per the

256
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:12,639
 

257
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,600
 estimate

258
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:15,600
 

259
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,520
 um if people won't upskill because of

260
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,520
 

261
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,479
 all these transformations and market

262
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,479
 

263
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,520
 demand

264
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:21,520
 

265
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,240
 60 to 70 percent of people will lose

266
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,240
 

267
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,199
 their job

268
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:25,199
 

269
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,919
 so you have to keep on adapting as per

270
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:27,919
 

271
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:31,120
 the market need

272
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:31,120
 

273
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:33,919
 the last point is that as per starts 80

274
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:33,919
 

275
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,320
 to 90 percent of serious injuries and

276
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:36,320
 

277
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,360
 accidents have been attributed to human

278
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,360
 

279
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,600
 error

280
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,600
 

281
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,039
 and it's all because people don't have

282
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,039
 

283
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,080
 down time to process

284
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:44,080
 

285
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,000
 information and think efficiently so all

286
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,000
 

287
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,600
 these challenges we are facing in

288
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,600
 

289
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:53,840
 today's world because of

290
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:53,840
 

291
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,840
 the fast disruptive change

292
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:54,550
 

293
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,560
 please go to the next line so um

294
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,560
 

295
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,680
 so we have been looking into some of the

296
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,680
 

297
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,360
 research or

298
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:05,360
 

299
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:08,479
 starts from ongoing um

300
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:08,479

 skills required in

304
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:13,360
 

305

 reference from the fourth

308
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:19,680
 

309
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:22,720
 article as per forbes article there are

310
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,720

313
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,160
 may notice that

314
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:26,160
 

315
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,960
 most of these skills are brain power

316
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,960
 

317
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,759
 skills

318
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:29,759
 

319
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,319
 like creativity problem solving

320
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:32,319
 

321
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,560
 resilience agility

322
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,560
 

323
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,840
 we can all develop all these skills over

324
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,840
 

325
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,120
 the period of time

326
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:39,120
 

327
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,600
 but to do that we need the brain fitness

328
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,600
 

329
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,720
 and that's why nero agility has become

330
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:42,720
 

331
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,080
 so important

332
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:46,080
 

333
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,080
 in today's century

334
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:46,950
 

335
00:06:46,960 --> 00:07:03,840
 go to the next one

336
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:05,830
 

337
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:12,720
 okay so we have been talking about um

338
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:12,720
 

339
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:14,960
 disruptive and transformative change

340
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,960
 

341
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,479
 um we have been talking about all these

342
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,479
 

343
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,560
 different elements that are

344
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,560
 

345
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,759
 being exceeded right now around the

346
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,759
 

347
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,000
 world and

348
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:22,000
 

349
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,120
 some of the challenges in terms of the

350
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,120
 

351
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,440
 skills and

352
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,440
 

353
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,240
 elements that employees are supposed to

354
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,240
 

355
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,280
 achieve

356
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:29,280
 

357
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:32,080
 these days to actually be successful

358
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:32,080
 

359
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,560
 but there is a big question around here

360
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:32,560
 

361
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,080
 how

362
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:36,080
 

363
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:39,599
 do we sustain change so there is

364
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:39,599
 

365
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:43,120
 um an individual um

366
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:43,120
 

367
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,400
 sorry called um ari de gas he is a

368
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,400
 

369
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,919
 former ceo

370
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:47,919
 

371
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,440
 of shell company and he tried to answer

372
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:49,440
 

373
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,919
 the question by saying

374
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,919
 

375
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,680
 that organizations needs to have the

376
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:53,680
 

377
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:57,280
 ability to actually learn

378
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:57,280
 

379
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:00,319
 and not only learn but learn faster that

380
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:00,319
 

381
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,400
 it's competitors to actually go ahead

382
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:02,400
 

383
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,919
 and sustain the change so this is

384
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,919
 

385
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,319
 extremely important

386
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:06,319
 

387
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,879
 so this means that now we're introducing

388
00:08:06,309 --> 00:08:08,879
 

389
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,280
 um a different concept which is the fact

390
00:08:08,869 --> 00:08:11,280
 

391
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:15,199
 that organization as assistants

392
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:15,199
 

393
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:18,000
 they can actually learn as well but

394
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:18,000
 

395
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,639
 maybe you're asking yourself what is a

396
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,639
 

397
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,680
 learning

398
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:21,680
 

399
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,199
 organization so when it comes to

400
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,199
 

401
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,680
 learning organization there are

402
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:23,680
 

403
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,599
 different

404
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,599
 

405
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,440
 experts around the world they have been

406
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:27,440
 

407
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,960
 studying this specific

408
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:30,960
 

409
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,599
 um concept and one of the most popular

410
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:31,599
 

411
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,519
 ones is

412
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:35,519
 

413
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:37,919
 come from uh peter sanch uh what he said

414
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:37,919
 

415
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,919
 and i'm gonna wanna read the the full

416
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:39,919
 

417
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,599
 thing here they're gonna get the dick at

418
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:41,599
 

419
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,279
 the end of the presentation

420
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:43,279
 

421
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,680
 but essentially what he said is a

422
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:45,680
 

423
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,040
 learning organization is an organization

424
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,040
 

425
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,720
 where people

426
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:50,720
 

427
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:53,839
 can actually expand can create can

428
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,839
 

429
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,600
 and no and more than that leaders in

430
00:08:53,829 --> 00:08:55,600
 

431
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,720
 that organization are supposed to

432
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,720
 

433
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,279
 nurture

434
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:59,279
 

435
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,360
 those kind of practices in there so i

436
00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:01,360
 

437
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,800
 want to highlight the fact that he is

438
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,800
 

439
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,360
 talking about the people

440
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,360
 

441
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,760
 inside that organization and as a

442
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,760
 

443
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,000
 collective we know that we learn better

444
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,000
 

445
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,560
 and

446
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,560
 

447
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,120
 that's why he's saying that again

448
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,120
 

449
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,640
 because

450
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,640
 

451
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,519
 people are the ones that make the

452
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,519
 

453
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,760
 organization what we have to do is then

454
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:17,760
 

455
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,519
 nurture those guys to actually get

456
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,519
 

457
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,440
 better at learning

458
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:21,440
 

459
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,040
 there are other experts like for

460
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,040
 

461
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,480
 instance ikojiro

462
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:26,480
 

463
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:29,120
 munaka that also expressed a similar

464
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,120
 

465
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,720
 idea around learning organizations so

466
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,720
 

467
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,839
 basically what he's saying is

468
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:33,839
 

469
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,480
 exactly something very very similar

470
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:36,480
 

471
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,680
 it's a company where you are supposed to

472
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,680
 

473
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,200
 be promoting

474
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:41,200
 

475
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:44,000
 uh this kind of behaviors around

476
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:44,000
 

477
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,440
 workers that are constantly getting new

478
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,440
 

479
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,399
 knowledge and their change those

480
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,399
 

481
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:51,040
 knowledge as a

482
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:51,040
 

483
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:53,600
 whole system

484
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,600
 

485
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,279
 but now it's time to have an activity

486
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,279
 

487
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,600
 that savita is going to be running

488
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:57,600
 

489
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:00,399
 sabita can you please share

490
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:00,399
 

491
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,959
 so um now let's capture from the

492
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:02,959
 

493
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,120
 audience what do you think

494
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:05,120
 

495
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,959
 are the challenges in creating the

496
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,959
 

497
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,440
 learning environments

498
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:09,440
 

499
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,560
 uh based on your own scenarios or

500
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,560
 

501
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,360
 experience

502
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:13,360
 

503
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,680
 so what you need to do go to any device

504
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:13,680
 

505
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,560
 or

506
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:18,560
 

507
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:23,440
 on your phone just type slido.com

508
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:23,440
 

509
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:27,839
 and use this code 84547

510
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:27,839
 

511
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:33,839
 and i'm going to share my screen

512
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:33,839
 

513
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:33,839
 to run the poll live

514
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:40,450
 

515
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:44,369
[Music]

516
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:56,550
 

517
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:03,360
 so go to slido.com enter the code 84547

518
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:04,790
 

519
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,959
 okay so we got

520
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:11,670
 

521
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,120
 so the first question is what is the

522
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:15,120
 

523
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,320
 most significant factor

524
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:18,320
 

525
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:21,680
 that impedes learning in organizations

526
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:21,680
 

527
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,880
 is it and clarity of goals or ignoring

528
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,880
 

529
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:28,160
 individuals learning

530
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:28,160
 

531
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:31,519
 style or something else

532
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:31,519
 

533
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:34,880
 i see most of the people

534
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:34,880
 

535
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:43,839
 voted for unclarity of goals and then

536
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:43,839
 

537
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:43,839
 ignoring individuals learning styles

538
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:47,670
 

539
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:53,200
 okay let's go to the next one

540
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:53,350
 

541
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,480
 what do you think about monetary

542
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,480
 

543
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,959
 compensation

544
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,959
 

545
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,440
 does it encourage new skills acquisition

546
00:11:58,949 --> 00:12:01,440
 

547
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,440
 or not

548
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:08,829
 

549
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,839
 interesting

550
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:16,310
 

551
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,920
 that one is really interesting because

552
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,920
 

553
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,279
 different people have different

554
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:23,279
 

555
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:25,519
 viewpoint around this

556
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:25,519
 

557
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,959
 in the beginning or in some scenarios

558
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:26,959
 

559
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,519
 definitely monitoring

560
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:29,519
 

561
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,880
 compensation can help but over the

562
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:30,880
 

563
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,440
 period of time

564
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:33,440
 

565
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:36,480
 some people think that we also need

566
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:36,480
 

567
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:40,160
 learning opportunities better positions

568
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:40,160
 

569
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,839
 um a collaborative work environment

570
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,839
 

571
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,720
 but i see most of the people going

572
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:44,720
 

573
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:53,760
 towards having good compensation

574
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:53,760
 

575
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:56,880
 yeah this is very very interesting

576
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,880
 

577
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,959
 so the next and the last question is

578
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,959
 

579
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,360
 uh what do you think what does up

580
00:12:58,949 --> 00:13:01,360
 

581
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,839
 obstruct your learning

582
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,839
 

583
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,720
 is it mental stress workforce

584
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:04,720
 

585
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:21,839
 frustration

586
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:21,839
 

587
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:21,839
 lack of sleep or something else

588
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:24,150
 

589
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,440
 work frustration is quite high yeah

590
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:32,470
 

591
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,560
 so this is very interesting because we

592
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,560
 

593
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,600
 can see here that some people

594
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:39,600
 

595
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:42,160
 are saying that that's one of the or the

596
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:42,160
 

597
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,199
 main issue here the word frustration

598
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:45,199
 

599
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:49,680
 but they care more about

600
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:49,680
 

601
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:52,639
 monetary compensation yeah

602
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:52,639
 

603
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,639
 very interesting

604
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:53,430
 

605
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:59,600
 so uh as we are on zoom

606
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:59,600
 

607
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:03,839
 you can unmute yourself and maybe share

608
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:03,839
 

609
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,839
 what do you mean by others here

610
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:05,030
 

611
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,880

 in both couple of those answers i said

618
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:15,040
 

619
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,959
 other for

620
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,959
 

621
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,279
 for me personally i think one of the

622
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:19,279
 

623
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,040
 constraints would be

624
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:21,040
 

625
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,920
 like in an organization where you're

626
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:21,920
 

627
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,800
 trying to make it a learning

628
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:22,800
 

629
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,000
 organization

630
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:26,000
 

631
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,199
 what i often find is is time right how

632
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,199
 

633
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,920
 do you protect that

634
00:14:27,189 --> 00:14:29,920
 

635
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,839
 time in your schedule meetings other

636
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,839
 

637
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,320
 commitments at work so that

638
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,320
 

639
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,000
 time is a priority to foster that

640
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,000
 

641
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,399
 learning and participate in any

642
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:38,399
 

643
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,360
 learning activity whether it's self or

644
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:39,360
 

645
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:44,160
 you know

646
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:44,160
 

647
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:47,120
 supported in a workshop or other

648
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:47,120
 

649
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,839
 yeah really true we also need time what

650
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:47,839
 

651
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,279
 you will do

652
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:51,279
 

653
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:54,639
 if you get the past to attend a training

654
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:54,639
 

655
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:58,240
 but you don't have time to attend it

656
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:58,240
 

657
00:14:54,639 --> 00:15:00,720
 yeah yes

658
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,720
 

659
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,279
 anyone else would like to share anything

660
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,279
 

661
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,000
 any

662
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:04,000
 

663
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:06,639
 kind of challenge you are facing from

664
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:06,639
 

665
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,639
 your learning

666
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:09,220
 

667
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:15,120
[Music]

668
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:15,120
 

669
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,120
 okay maybe we can go back

670
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:16,310
 

671
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,639
 there's a comment or two in the uh chat

672
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,639
 

673
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,920
 window if you want to look

674
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:23,920
 

675
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,440
 or i could read them to you lack of

676
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,440
 

677
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,480
 motivation

678
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:28,480
 

679
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,639
 yeah for some it's a lack of motivation

680
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,639
 

681
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,160
 a lack of direction

682
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:34,160
 

683
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,160
 or a freedom to attend

684
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:39,189
 

685
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,120
 yeah those are very common factors

686
00:15:41,749 --> 00:15:43,120
 

687
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,399
 absolutely and we're going to be

688
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,399
 

689
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,920
 touching

690
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:47,920
 

691
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,880
 some in in a way or another we're going

692
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:48,880
 

693
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,800
 to be talking about

694
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,800
 

695
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,160
 all those difference later in the

696
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,160
 

697
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,839
 presentation

698
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:55,839
 

699
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,839
 um for sure

700
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:58,230
 

701
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,839
 okay so now let's get back to the

702
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,839
 

703
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,839
 presentation

704
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:04,710
 

705
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,800
 do you want to um share any more

706
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,800
 

707
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,399
 comments any comments savita before we

708
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,399
 

709
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,720
 move forward

710
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:12,720
 

711
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,000
 i think we are good uh we can look into

712
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,000
 

713
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,320
 some of the factors

714
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:16,320
 

715
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,560
 which will really touch upon all these

716
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,560
 

717
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,480
 comments which we received right now

718
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:22,480
 

719
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:25,759
 exactly okay very well

720
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:25,759
 

721
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,680
 so the title or some of the

722
00:16:25,749 --> 00:16:27,680
 

723
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,959
 one of the key elements of this session

724
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,959
 

725
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,160
 was around

726
00:16:28,949 --> 00:16:32,160
 

727
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:34,000
 uh near agility um so

728
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,000
 

729
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,279
 for those of you that are not quite

730
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,279
 

731
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,320
 familiar with this

732
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:38,320
 

733
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:41,199
 specific concept your agility is

734
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:41,199
 

735
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:43,759
 about the brain based factors that

736
00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:43,759
 

737
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,279
 basically influence the easy the speed

738
00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:45,279
 

739
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,279
 and the flexibility

740
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:47,279
 

741
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,040
 with which people learn think and

742
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:49,040
 

743
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,720
 process information so basically we're

744
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,720
 

745
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,199
 gonna be talking about

746
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,199
 

747
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,160
 or trying to cover all those elements

748
00:16:53,189 --> 00:16:54,160
 

749
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:58,079
 that

750
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:58,079
 

751
00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:00,079
 maybe you need to monitor and take care

752
00:16:58,069 --> 00:17:00,079
 

753
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,519
 in order for you to become a better

754
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:01,519
 

755
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:04,959
 learning learner

756
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:04,959
 

757
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:08,720
 as an individual okay

758
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:08,720
 

759
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:12,480
 so there is a professional called andre

760
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:12,480
 

761
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,240
 bermuden um he's he specializes in their

762
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,240
 

763
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,079
 agility and he takes

764
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,079
 

765
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,000
 he has been taking a lot of time

766
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:18,000
 

767
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:21,120
 investigating this

768
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:21,120
 

769
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,520
 and according to this individual there

770
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:21,520
 

771
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,319
 are

772
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:24,319
 

773
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,199
 six different factors that we need to

774
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:25,199
 

775
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:29,120
 basically

776
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:29,120
 

777
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,480
 monitor and be aware of to ensure that

778
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,480
 

779
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,840
 you have

780
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:33,840
 

781
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:37,120
 all the tools to become a better learner

782
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:37,120
 

783
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:39,280
 or to ensure learning okay so the

784
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:39,280
 

785
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:43,280
 different elements are

786
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:43,280
 

787
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:46,400
 uh brain fitness stress sleep

788
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,400
 

789
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:49,039
 movement attitude and food

790
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:49,039
 

791
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,880
 okay we're gonna be basically explaining

792
00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:50,880
 

793
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:53,360
 each of these different factors so we

794
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,360
 

795
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,480
 get a better understanding of why

796
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:56,480
 

797
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:59,840
 why they are so important

798
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:59,840
 

799
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:03,200
 so let's get started with brain fitness

800
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:03,200
 

801
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:05,280
 before we uh go deeper into what is this

802
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,280
 

803
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,320
 about it's very important to understand

804
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,320
 

805
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,039
 that

806
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:09,039
 

807
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,039
 we have and maybe some of you the

808
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:11,039
 

809
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:14,240
 majority of you already know this

810
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:14,240
 

811
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:16,480
 but the brain has two hemispheres

812
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:16,480
 

813
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,240
 the ref the right and the left and

814
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,240
 

815
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,480
 hemisphere

816
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,480
 

817
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,520
 when it comes to the two hemispheres

818
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,520
 

819
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,559
 we're gonna uh

820
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:24,559
 

821
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:27,280
 it's important to know as well that

822
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:27,280
 

823
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,000
 the uh the left side is going to be

824
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,000
 

825
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,000
 controlling

826
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,000
 

827
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,840
 all the movements and all the activities

828
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,840
 

829
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 on the opposite side

830
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:34,000
 

831
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,520
 and the same will happen for the right

832
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,520
 

833
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,679
 side

834
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,679
 

835
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,360
 when we talk about brain thickness what

836
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:39,360
 

837
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:43,039
 we're trying to say in here

838
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:43,039
 

839
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:45,520
 is that basically um the individual

840
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:45,520
 

841
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,240
 or when you when your brain is properly

842
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,240
 

843
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,160
 fit

844
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,160
 

845
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,520
 is because you have the ability to

846
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,520
 

847
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,880
 control both

848
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:52,880
 

849
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:56,080
 hemispheres okay and

850
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:56,080
 

851
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:59,280
 they not such a good news

852
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:59,280
 

853
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,000
 is that unfortunately we are not born

854
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,000
 

855
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,960
 with this

856
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:02,960
 

857
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,160
 specific attribute of controlling

858
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,160
 

859
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,520
 balsamic fear

860
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:07,520
 

861
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:10,880
 hemisphere simultaneously okay

862
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:10,880
 

863
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:13,840
 instead we will need to basically

864
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:13,840
 

865
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,080
 exercise and exercise a lot to develop

866
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:16,080
 

867
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,080
 this

868
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:16,470
 

869
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,840
 the idea is that if you manage to

870
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:22,840
 

871
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,240
 utilize both hemisphere do a

872
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,240
 

873
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,960
 simultaneously

874
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,960
 

875
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,039
 then you will become a cutting-edge

876
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:29,039
 

877
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,520
 individual and what we meant to say with

878
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:29,520
 

879
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,559
 this

880
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:32,559
 

881
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:36,320
 is that you will be able to

882
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:36,320
 

883
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:38,640
 basically digest a large volume of data

884
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,640
 

885
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,520
 faster and it will be more natural for

886
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:39,520
 

887
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,120
 you

888
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:43,120
 

889
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:45,679
 okay so there are a few recommendations

890
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:45,679
 

891
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,400
 that we can give around this specific

892
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:46,400
 

893
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,480
 topic

894
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:48,480
 

895
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,559
 just to ensure your brain fitness and

896
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,559
 

897
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,600
 how do you exercise your brain

898
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:53,600
 

899
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,720
 so the first element is of course to

900
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,720
 

901
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,200
 have some mental

902
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,200
 

903
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,799
 exercise so i'm going to show you right

904
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,799
 

905
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,919
 now one of

906
00:19:58,789 --> 00:20:01,919
 

907
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:03,280
 one that is very very easy that you can

908
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,280
 

909
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,799
 practice by yourself

910
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,799
 

911
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,880
 so hopefully you can see me in the

912
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:06,880
 

913
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:09,760
 screen right now all you have to do is

914
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:09,760
 

915
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:12,799
 put your hands together like this

916
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,799
 

917
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:15,520
 and then you're gonna try to touch your

918
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:15,520
 

919
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:18,559
 the the tip of your nose with one hand

920
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:18,559
 

921
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,720
 and when the opposite hand just crossing

922
00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:20,720
 

923
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:24,000
 your arms like this

924
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:24,000
 

925
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:29,280
 you're gonna touch your ear

926
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:29,280
 

927
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,280
 then you will clap and do the opposite

928
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:29,350
 

929
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:35,919
 do the clap and try the same

930
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:35,919
 

931
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,840
 so you will realize that i think it

932
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:37,840
 

933
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:42,240
 looks kind of silly right

934
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:42,240
 

935
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:46,000
 but it takes some time

936
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:46,000
 

937
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:48,720
 for the brain to digest or to understand

938
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:48,720
 

939
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,320
 if you're moving in the right direction

940
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,320
 

941
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,880
 it takes a little bit of

942
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,880
 

943
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,720
 time to digest to understand how to

944
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,720
 

945
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,679
 coordinate that movement

946
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:57,679
 

947
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,360
 so that is an excellent exercise the

948
00:20:57,669 --> 00:20:59,360
 

949
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,600
 other thing that you can do is

950
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:01,600
 

951
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,799
 while you're working now with copy 19

952
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:04,799
 

953
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:07,039
 try to change your activity so is um

954
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:07,039
 

955
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:09,280
 it's proven that for instance if you

956
00:21:07,029 --> 00:21:09,280
 

957
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,159
 work for a particular time a period of

958
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,159
 

959
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,799
 time

960
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:12,799
 

961
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,240
 on an activity and then you change that

962
00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:14,240
 

963
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:17,120
 activity and just switch

964
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:17,120
 

965
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,640
 from activity a to activity b what's

966
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,640
 

967
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,559
 gonna happen is that you're gonna bring

968
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:20,559
 

969
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,360
 some oxygen to your brain and that's

970
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:21,360
 

971
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,480
 gonna

972
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:24,480
 

973
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,880
 um create the right atmosphere to your

974
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,880
 

975
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:30,480
 brain so it doesn't get that

976
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:30,480
 

977
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:33,280
 the body there uh try to read

978
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:33,280
 

979
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,679
 in action like the actual handwriting

980
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:35,679
 

981
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,760
 try to use your hand to write

982
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,760
 

983
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,360
 down because that's gonna stimulate your

984
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,360
 

985
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,320
 brain as well

986
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:42,320
 

987
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,840
 try to learn new things and just to

988
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,840
 

989
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,039
 finalize the lease

990
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:47,039
 

991
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:49,440
 for now try to exercise as well and we

992
00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:49,440
 

993
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:52,559
 all know that exercising is the key

994
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:52,559
 

995
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:57,039
 to keep a healthy body okay

996
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:57,039
 

997
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:59,840
 any questions about this specific uh

998
00:21:57,029 --> 00:21:59,840
 

999
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,840
 factor

1000
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:03,510
 

1001
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,919
 yeah it's really hard to do the exercise

1002
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,919
 

1003
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,320
 so just practice because that's going to

1004
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:08,320
 

1005
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,520
 keep

1006
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:11,520
 

1007
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:14,559
 your brain in shape

1008
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:14,559
 

1009
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,120
 the second uh factor in here will be

1010
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:15,120
 

1011
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:19,200
 around

1012
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:19,200
 

1013
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:20,720
 stress okay so before we jump and start

1014
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,720
 

1015
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,240
 talking about stress

1016
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,240
 

1017
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,919
 uh i would like to share with you a

1018
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,919
 

1019
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,880
 little bit of information in your

1020
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:24,880
 

1021
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,640
 background

1022
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:26,640
 

1023
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,919
 remember when i mentioned that you have

1024
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:27,919
 

1025
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,440
 your left

1026
00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:31,440
 

1027
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:34,480
 hemisphere and your right hemisphere so

1028
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:34,480
 

1029
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,600
 essentially each mf hemisphere is going

1030
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:35,600
 

1031
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,600
 to take care of

1032
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,600
 

1033
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,679
 some of the abilities that you're going

1034
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,679
 

1035
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,440
 to have as a learner

1036
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:41,440
 

1037
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,280
 so if we look at the graph right now

1038
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,280
 

1039
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,880
 we'll have in one side that

1040
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,880
 

1041
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,960
 the right hemisphere is going to be

1042
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:46,960
 

1043
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,520
 taking off all that

1044
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,520
 

1045
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,960
 all those different um i would say

1046
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:50,960
 

1047
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,600
 skills that

1048
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:53,600
 

1049
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,080
 are more into the soft side with the

1050
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,080
 

1051
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,240
 arts

1052
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:56,240
 

1053
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,679
 with the feelings with the intuition

1054
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,679
 

1055
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,240
 imagination

1056
00:22:57,669 --> 00:23:00,240
 

1057
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,600
 um and then the left side is going to

1058
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:01,600
 

1059
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,039
 have analysis

1060
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:05,039
 

1061
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:08,720
 logic idea it will be that numerical

1062
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:08,720
 

1063
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:12,240
 side of your brain so every single of

1064
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:12,240
 

1065
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:16,000
 us uh basically have

1066
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:16,000
 

1067
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:19,440
 a dominant side in a non-dominant side

1068
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:19,440
 

1069
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,240
 or non-dominant hemisphere so what's

1070
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:20,240
 

1071
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,559
 going to happen

1072
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,559
 

1073
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,679
 is that for people that are pretty good

1074
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:23,679
 

1075
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:27,120
 in math

1076
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:27,120
 

1077
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,679
 and are into more like give me the data

1078
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:27,679
 

1079
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,640
 or

1080
00:23:27,669 --> 00:23:30,640
 

1081
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,760
 is very logical that means that your

1082
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:31,760
 

1083
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,919
 dominant side

1084
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,919
 

1085
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,520
 will be the left hemisphere because

1086
00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:35,520
 

1087
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,559
 you're pretty good at that

1088
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:38,559
 

1089
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,600
 it's in that those specific items listed

1090
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:39,600
 

1091
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,240
 there

1092
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:42,240
 

1093
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,760
 if on the other high side sorry you are

1094
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,760
 

1095
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,200
 into arts

1096
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:47,200
 

1097
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,840
 feelings um intuition etc this means

1098
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:47,840
 

1099
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,559
 that

1100
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:50,559
 

1101
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,960
 you the dominant side of your brain will

1102
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:50,960
 

1103
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,000
 be

1104
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:54,000
 

1105
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:56,080
 on the right side okay

1106
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:56,080
 

1107
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,480
 so of course when we talk about

1108
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:58,480
 

1109
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,880
 non-dominant and dominant that doesn't

1110
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:58,880
 

1111
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,120
 mean

1112
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:01,120
 

1113
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,720
 that it's not like journal using your

1114
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,720
 

1115
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,880
 non-dominant side

1116
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,880
 

1117
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,360
 you're using it it's just that it's not

1118
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:07,360
 

1119
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,600
 as powerful it's not the one that is

1120
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,600
 

1121
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,640
 driving the one that is leading the

1122
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,640
 

1123
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,640
 process of

1124
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:14,640
 

1125
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:17,200
 learning so when we talk about a stress

1126
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:17,200
 

1127
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,279
 we can say that a stress can be defined

1128
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:19,279
 

1129
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:23,039
 as a losing control

1130
00:24:19,269 --> 00:24:23,039
 

1131
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:25,360
 over the non-dominant side of your brain

1132
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:25,360
 

1133
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,320
 okay so this means that when you lose

1134
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,320
 

1135
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,080
 that control

1136
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:28,080
 

1137
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,679
 then the entire process of learning

1138
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,679
 

1139
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,720
 becomes slower

1140
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:32,720
 

1141
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:35,039
 harder and longer just to be an example

1142
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:35,039
 

1143
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:38,159
 if i'm pretty good at math

1144
00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:38,159
 

1145
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,480
 logics and things like that and meaning

1146
00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:38,480
 

1147
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,760
 that

1148
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:41,760
 

1149
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:44,880
 my dominant side is the left

1150
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:44,880
 

1151
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:47,600
 while i enter that period of stress

1152
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:47,600
 

1153
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,159
 what's gonna happen is now that i'm and

1154
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,159
 

1155
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,760
 zero

1156
00:24:48,149 --> 00:24:51,760
 

1157
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:54,880
 my creativity goes to zero it means that

1158
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:54,880
 

1159
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,080
 it's gonna be more difficult like way

1160
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,080
 

1161
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,880
 more difficult

1162
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:58,880
 

1163
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,400
 for me to be creative to do a painting

1164
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:00,400
 

1165
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,640
 to express my feelings

1166
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:02,640
 

1167
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,679
 that's exactly what is the stress is

1168
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:03,679
 

1169
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:08,000
 doing for me

1170
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:08,000
 

1171
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:11,120
 and we don't want that so

1172
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:11,120
 

1173
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,640
 now how is this related to learning and

1174
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,640
 

1175
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,279
 how

1176
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:15,279
 

1177
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,640
 and why do we need to cope with stress

1178
00:25:15,269 --> 00:25:16,640
 

1179
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,679
 so i'm gonna share with you

1180
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:19,679
 

1181
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,039
 two um two statements that you need to

1182
00:25:19,669 --> 00:25:21,039
 

1183
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,640
 keep in mind

1184
00:25:21,029 --> 00:25:24,640
 

1185
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:27,840
 um that maybe are going to make you

1186
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:27,840
 

1187
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:29,760
 wonder maybe i should take care of this

1188
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,760
 

1189
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:33,120
 stress and avoid this

1190
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:33,120
 

1191
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:36,559
 so the first one is around health

1192
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:36,559
 

1193
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:39,919
 okay so an estimate 75 to 90

1194
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:39,919
 

1195
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:42,799
 90 percent of all illnesses

1196
00:25:39,909 --> 00:25:42,799
 

1197
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,120
 they have their they are they is origin

1198
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:43,120
 

1199
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:46,559
 in

1200
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:46,559
 

1201
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:49,540
 chronic stress so of course if you're

1202
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:49,540
 

1203
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:51,039
 sick you won't be able to um

1204
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:51,039
 

1205
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:53,120
[Music]

1206
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:53,120
 

1207
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,400
 basically learn because obviously you're

1208
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,400
 

1209
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,679
 not feeling that

1210
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:57,679
 

1211
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:59,840
 well right and you don't want that

1212
00:25:57,669 --> 00:25:59,840
 

1213
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,520
 at all so one of the things that we know

1214
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,520
 

1215
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:05,360
 according to the sources

1216
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:05,360
 

1217
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:07,760
 is that uh one or the most

1218
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:07,760
 

1219
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,480
 critical element that is creating stress

1220
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:08,480
 

1221
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,679
 for us

1222
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:11,679
 

1223
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:15,440
 these days is the fact that we

1224
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:15,440
 

1225
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:18,720
 we are exposed to too much

1226
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:18,720
 

1227
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,880
 data too much information too fast

1228
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,880
 

1229
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,240
 okay and that brings us to the next

1230
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,240
 

1231
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,840
 element in here

1232
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:25,840
 

1233
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:28,240
 which is around performance so obviously

1234
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:28,240
 

1235
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,640
 if you feel that oh my god this is too

1236
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:30,640
 

1237
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:33,840
 much information for me you will feel

1238
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,840
 

1239
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:36,080
 overwhelmed and then you might feel that

1240
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:36,080
 

1241
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:39,120
 you're not good enough

1242
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:39,120
 

1243
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:41,120
 to be effective okay so

1244
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,120
 

1245
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,720
 some of the recommendations that we can

1246
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,720
 

1247
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:46,000
 share with you around this

1248
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:46,000
 

1249
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,640
 specific factor are in the ideal

1250
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:46,640
 

1251
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,159
 environment

1252
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:48,159
 

1253
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,880
 just to give an example if you're a

1254
00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:50,880
 

1255
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,840
 scroll master or in any organization as

1256
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:51,840
 

1257
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,520
 a leader

1258
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:55,520
 

1259
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:56,159
 try to create a site a space that is

1260
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,159
 

1261
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,320
 safe

1262
00:26:56,149 --> 00:26:58,320
 

1263
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:01,039
 where people can share their ideas and

1264
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:01,039
 

1265
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,039
 their feelings

1266
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:01,190
 

1267
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,559
 try to set working agreements between

1268
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:04,559
 

1269
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,799
 you

1270
00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:06,799
 

1271
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,760
 and the team or you and that individual

1272
00:27:06,789 --> 00:27:07,760
 

1273
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:10,080
 that you are

1274
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,080
 

1275
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,840
 working with just to ensure that you are

1276
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,840
 

1277
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:15,039
 very clear about how you're going to be

1278
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:15,039
 

1279
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:18,559
 handling stressful situations

1280
00:27:15,029 --> 00:27:18,559
 

1281
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:20,480
 uh of course exercise yoga if for

1282
00:27:18,549 --> 00:27:20,480
 

1283
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:23,279
 instance you have the opportunity

1284
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:23,279
 

1285
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,320
 to reach out to health specialists in

1286
00:27:23,269 --> 00:27:24,320
 

1287
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:27,360
 your organization

1288
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:27,360
 

1289
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:30,480
 usually they bring a little they can

1290
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:30,480
 

1291
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,159
 they offer support to the employees so

1292
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:32,159
 

1293
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,840
 take advantage of those

1294
00:27:32,149 --> 00:27:35,840
 

1295
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:38,080
 um different things take breaks

1296
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:38,080
 

1297
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,279
 with kobe 19 it seems like we're just

1298
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,279
 

1299
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,600
 stuck

1300
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:41,600
 

1301
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:43,279
 working with our computers and not

1302
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:43,279
 

1303
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:46,559
 moving that much so

1304
00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:46,559
 

1305
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:49,120
 just step up move around

1306
00:27:46,549 --> 00:27:49,120
 

1307
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,159
 uh share with your family share with the

1308
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,159
 

1309
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,200
 people that

1310
00:27:50,149 --> 00:27:53,200
 

1311
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:56,720
 can actually make you feel better

1312
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:56,720
 

1313
00:27:53,200 --> 00:28:00,399
 just to ensure that you that stress just

1314
00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:00,399
 

1315
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,399
 goes away okay

1316
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:01,510
 

1317
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:08,159
 so very good so

1318
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:08,159
 

1319
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:11,200
 the reason um sorry the next

1320
00:28:08,149 --> 00:28:11,200
 

1321
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:14,320
 uh factoring here will be sleep

1322
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:14,320
 

1323
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:17,120
 and when it comes to sleep

1324
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:17,120
 

1325
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,919
 um essentially what we want to or the

1326
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:17,919
 

1327
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:21,200
 message

1328
00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:21,200
 

1329
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:23,600
 we want you to take with you is that

1330
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:23,600
 

1331
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,600
 we need to ensure that we have a good

1332
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,600
 

1333
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,840
 sleep hygiene this means that

1334
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:27,840
 

1335
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,440
 you have the proper space where you can

1336
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,440
 

1337
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,480
 rest and you can

1338
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:32,480
 

1339
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,640
 relax without being interrupted

1340
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,640
 

1341
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,600
 okay the idea that you have enough and

1342
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,600
 

1343
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:40,720
 not enough time to feel relaxed to feel

1344
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:40,720
 

1345
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:43,679
 okay uh interested

1346
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:43,679
 

1347
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,240
 but the big question here is do you

1348
00:28:43,669 --> 00:28:44,240
 

1349
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,120
 actually

1350
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:47,120
 

1351
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,799
 know what happens to your body when you

1352
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,799
 

1353
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,200
 don't sleep enough

1354
00:28:48,789 --> 00:28:51,200
 

1355
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,799
 so let me share with you some fats these

1356
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,799
 

1357
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,679
 are results of

1358
00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:55,679
 

1359
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:57,520
 some investigations as well and as you

1360
00:28:55,669 --> 00:28:57,520
 

1361
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,159
 will see the different sources at the

1362
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,159
 

1363
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,720
 bottom

1364
00:28:58,149 --> 00:29:00,720
 

1365
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:02,960
 of the slides that we are sharing uh

1366
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,960
 

1367
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:06,000
 today

1368
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:06,000
 

1369
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:08,159
 so when you don't sleep this is exactly

1370
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:08,159
 

1371
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,240
 or some of these are some of the things

1372
00:29:08,149 --> 00:29:10,240
 

1373
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:12,799
 that you might experience

1374
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:12,799
 

1375
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,880
 so the number one thing is that

1376
00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:14,880
 

1377
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:19,039
 basically you're preventing your brain

1378
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:19,039
 

1379
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:20,000
 from being able to um basically take new

1380
00:29:19,029 --> 00:29:20,000
 

1381
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,880
 memories

1382
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:22,880
 

1383
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,640
 so just to give an example imagine that

1384
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:24,640
 

1385
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,760
 your brain is like a

1386
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,760
 

1387
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,600
 brand new database or half waveform

1388
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,600
 

1389
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,679
 database with some data

1390
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:31,679
 

1391
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,640
 what is going to happen we just you

1392
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:32,640
 

1393
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,440
 don't sleep

1394
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:35,440
 

1395
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,240
 is that basically you are creating a

1396
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:36,240
 

1397
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,880
 process

1398
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:38,880
 

1399
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,480
 that is going to avoid your brain from

1400
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:40,480
 

1401
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,880
 bringing more

1402
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:42,880
 

1403
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,399
 information inside going back to the

1404
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:44,399
 

1405
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,200
 sample of the database

1406
00:29:44,389 --> 00:29:47,200
 

1407
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,000
 you're placing a process in there that

1408
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:48,000
 

1409
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,960
 basically is

1410
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:50,960
 

1411
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,880
 stopping the data from being recorded

1412
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,880
 

1413
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,679
 inside your database

1414
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:55,679
 

1415
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:57,120
 this means that you always have the same

1416
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:57,120
 

1417
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,000
 source of information

1418
00:29:57,110 --> 00:30:00,000
 

1419
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,799
 and you are not adding anything new in

1420
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:00,799
 

1421
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,600
 there

1422
00:30:00,789 --> 00:30:05,600
 

1423
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:08,080
 so please rest take some time to sleep

1424
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:08,080
 

1425
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,080
 the second element that is gonna happen

1426
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:10,080
 

1427
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,679
 or the the second thing i can share with

1428
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,679
 

1429
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,080
 you about sleep

1430
00:30:11,669 --> 00:30:14,080
 

1431
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,960
 is that if you don't sleep this is

1432
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:14,960
 

1433
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:18,880
 what's happened

1434
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:18,880
 

1435
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:22,000
 when you sleep um basically your brain

1436
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:22,000
 

1437
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:25,279
 um is supposed to get rid of

1438
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:25,279
 

1439
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,679
 some toxins in there they are the ones

1440
00:30:25,269 --> 00:30:25,679
 

1441
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,760
 that

1442
00:30:25,669 --> 00:30:27,760
 

1443
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,520
 basically are associated with

1444
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,520
 

1445
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,720
 alzheimer's disease

1446
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:32,720
 

1447
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:36,480
 which is a terrible terrible disease

1448
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:36,480
 

1449
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,840
 so that specific toxin is called beta

1450
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:37,840
 

1451
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,600
 amiloid

1452
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:41,600
 

1453
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:43,760
 so if you keep accumulating that

1454
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,760
 

1455
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,120
 and you don't allow your brain to

1456
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,120
 

1457
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,840
 basically

1458
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:47,840
 

1459
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,679
 wash all that toxin what happens is that

1460
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,679
 

1461
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:53,200
 it gets accumulated

1462
00:30:49,669 --> 00:30:53,200
 

1463
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:56,559
 and then your chances to get

1464
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:56,559
 

1465
00:30:53,200 --> 00:31:00,000
 that specific disease increases

1466
00:30:56,549 --> 00:31:00,000
 

1467
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:02,880
 okay so again allow your body to

1468
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:02,880
 

1469
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,320
 take enough time to sleep and to rest so

1470
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:04,320
 

1471
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:09,039
 they have time to

1472
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:09,039
 

1473
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:09,039
 wash all the dirt okay

1474
00:31:10,389 --> 00:31:10,389
 

1475
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:15,679
 we there's the next one you already know

1476
00:31:13,269 --> 00:31:15,679
 

1477
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:17,440
 affects the reproductive system you

1478
00:31:15,669 --> 00:31:17,440
 

1479
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:20,399
 might already know about

1480
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:20,399
 

1481
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,360
 what happened when a rebel reproductive

1482
00:31:20,389 --> 00:31:21,360
 

1483
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:24,480
 system is

1484
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:24,480
 

1485
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,279
 is not working as expected uh that can

1486
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:25,279
 

1487
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,559
 get

1488
00:31:25,269 --> 00:31:28,559
 

1489
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:32,159
 pro produce a lot of stressing people

1490
00:31:28,549 --> 00:31:32,159
 

1491
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:34,640
 basically and last but not least

1492
00:31:32,149 --> 00:31:34,640
 

1493
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,679
 is going to impact your immune system

1494
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:35,679
 

1495
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,200
 and you're not

1496
00:31:35,669 --> 00:31:37,200
 

1497
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:39,600
 if you're because you're not getting

1498
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:39,600
 

1499
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,480
 that reboot of your cardiovascular

1500
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:40,480
 

1501
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,279
 system

1502
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:43,279
 

1503
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,799
 so your blood pressure rises essentially

1504
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:44,799
 

1505
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:47,279
 i don't know if you have noticed this

1506
00:31:44,789 --> 00:31:47,279
 

1507
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:50,480
 but people that were doing the night

1508
00:31:47,269 --> 00:31:50,480
 

1509
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:51,760
 and they have to do some different

1510
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,760
 

1511
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,480
 activities during the day

1512
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:54,480
 

1513
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,279
 so the aim is sleeping just a couple of

1514
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:55,279
 

1515
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,279
 hours or

1516
00:31:55,269 --> 00:31:57,279
 

1517
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:59,360
 not enough time what happens is that

1518
00:31:57,269 --> 00:31:59,360
 

1519
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,640
 they eventually get sick they need to go

1520
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,640
 

1521
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:04,559
 to the doctor

1522
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:04,559
 

1523
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:07,039
 because their blood pressure is too high

1524
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:07,039
 

1525
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,840
 so again you don't want to get to that

1526
00:32:07,029 --> 00:32:07,840
 

1527
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:10,240
 point

1528
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:10,240
 

1529
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,240
 okay

1530
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:10,950
 

1531
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,399
 so i'm gonna give you some

1532
00:32:11,909 --> 00:32:14,399
 

1533
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:16,480
 recommendations about

1534
00:32:14,389 --> 00:32:16,480
 

1535
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,600
 sleeping times and what to do about

1536
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:17,600
 

1537
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,080
 sleep

1538
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:20,080
 

1539
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:22,240
 um for the picture that i have here in

1540
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:22,240
 

1541
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,240
 the middle i love it because

1542
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:24,240
 

1543
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,440
 it basically illustrates exactly what is

1544
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,440
 

1545
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,919
 happening at night

1546
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:27,919
 

1547
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:30,080
 or when you are sleeping and it's the

1548
00:32:27,909 --> 00:32:30,080
 

1549
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:32,480
 fact that you're giving the chance

1550
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:32,480
 

1551
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,760
 to your brain to get clean and to be

1552
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,760
 

1553
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,960
 ready to receive

1554
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:36,960
 

1555
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:40,000
 more information and to learn more

1556
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:40,000
 

1557
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:43,120
 okay so

1558
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:43,120
 

1559
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,440
 if you look at this table over here

1560
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:45,440
 

1561
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:48,000
 this one is provided by organization in

1562
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:48,000
 

1563
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:51,200
 the u.s called the slid foundation

1564
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:51,200
 

1565
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:54,080
 these are the recommended times

1566
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:54,080
 

1567
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,039
 check out your age and look at the

1568
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,039
 

1569
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,000
 different range

1570
00:32:55,029 --> 00:32:58,000
 

1571
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:59,120
 and the recommended hours so you ensure

1572
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:59,120
 

1573
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,559
 that you don't have

1574
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:02,559
 

1575
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:07,120
 those toxins in your brain okay

1576
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:07,120
 

1577
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:08,720
 so very good now we're gonna move on to

1578
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,720
 

1579
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:13,120
 the next factor

1580
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:13,120
 

1581
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,919
 uh so i see that we are getting a lot of

1582
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:13,919
 

1583
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:17,120
 questions

1584
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:17,120
 

1585
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:21,679
 uh maybe we'll take towards the end

1586
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:21,679
 

1587
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:23,360
 yep okay so uh

1588
00:33:21,669 --> 00:33:23,360
 

1589
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,440
 as marriott mentioned that in the

1590
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:25,440
 

1591
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:28,320
 beginning we have six vectors

1592
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:28,320
 

1593
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:31,120
 and she explained three of those uh the

1594
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:31,120
 

1595
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:33,519
 next one is about movement

1596
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:33,519
 

1597
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,799
 so movement is very much related to your

1598
00:33:33,509 --> 00:33:34,799
 

1599
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:37,360
 exercise

1600
00:33:34,789 --> 00:33:37,360
 

1601
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:38,799
 and it's not only exercise going to gm

1602
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,799
 

1603
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,440
 it's exercise

1604
00:33:38,789 --> 00:33:41,440
 

1605
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:43,760
 and the activity throughout the day

1606
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:43,760
 

1607
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,960
 because when we do the exercise

1608
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:46,960
 

1609
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:49,440
 uh then the oxygen flows into the brain

1610
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:49,440
 

1611
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,679
 and that helps us in our brain health

1612
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:51,679
 

1613
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,799
 and fitness

1614
00:33:51,669 --> 00:33:54,799
 

1615
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:57,760
 so uh and it's uh

1616
00:33:54,789 --> 00:33:57,760
 

1617
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:58,159
 so the neuroscientists say that uh doing

1618
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:58,159
 

1619
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,799
 some

1620
00:33:58,149 --> 00:34:00,799
 

1621
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:03,600
 stretching also promotes uh increased

1622
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:03,600
 

1623
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:06,720
 focus and concentration

1624
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:06,720
 

1625
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:11,119
 so what we can do is start when we are

1626
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:11,119
 

1627
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:13,520
 um at in the workplace what you can do

1628
00:34:11,109 --> 00:34:13,520
 

1629
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,320
 for the movement so we see that when we

1630
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,320
 

1631
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,720
 go to work

1632
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:16,720
 

1633
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,520
 most of the people they just sit on

1634
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,520
 

1635
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,679
 their desk

1636
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:19,679
 

1637
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,679
 for the whole day that means you are

1638
00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:21,679
 

1639
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,359
 losing the activity if you are losing

1640
00:34:21,669 --> 00:34:23,359
 

1641
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,599
 the activity that means you are

1642
00:34:23,349 --> 00:34:25,599
 

1643
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:28,240
 impairing your brain health

1644
00:34:25,589 --> 00:34:28,240
 

1645
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:30,480
 and now we are working from home so it's

1646
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,480
 

1647
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:32,399
 the same situation

1648
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:32,399
 

1649
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,159
 and maybe i feel like we are having more

1650
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:34,159
 

1651
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:36,159
 meetings back to back

1652
00:34:34,149 --> 00:34:36,159
 

1653
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,919
 so we don't need to move from one room

1654
00:34:36,149 --> 00:34:37,919
 

1655
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,119
 through another room or one floor to

1656
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,119
 

1657
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:41,919
 another four

1658
00:34:39,109 --> 00:34:41,919
 

1659
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:44,960
 so we are reducing our activity so what

1660
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:44,960
 

1661
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:48,399
 we can do is start some of the

1662
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:48,399
 

1663
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:51,520
 basic tips is um just

1664
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:51,520
 

1665
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:51,919
 stand while doing your work or you can

1666
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:51,919
 

1667
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,119
 take

1668
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:55,119
 

1669
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:57,440
 some of your meetings on your phone

1670
00:34:55,109 --> 00:34:57,440
 

1671
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,400
 and you can just walk around in your

1672
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,400
 

1673
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,240
 backyard

1674
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:02,240
 

1675
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,240
 and while having the conversation

1676
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:02,630
 

1677
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:07,520
 you might know that uh this standing

1678
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:07,520
 

1679
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:11,680
 decks are becoming very popular

1680
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:11,680
 

1681
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:14,640
 and if you use the standing desk means

1682
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:14,640
 

1683
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,359
 you are a bit more active than while you

1684
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:15,359
 

1685
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,480
 are sitting

1686
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:18,480
 

1687
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:20,880
 so it helps in the oxygen flow

1688
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:20,880
 

1689
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,119
 into your brain which will impact your

1690
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:23,119
 

1691
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:26,320
 brain health

1692
00:35:23,109 --> 00:35:26,320
 

1693
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:29,359
 so um all these small tips

1694
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:29,359
 

1695
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,880
 uh help you in um

1696
00:35:29,349 --> 00:35:30,880
 

1697
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:33,040
 maintaining the brain health and

1698
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:33,040
 

1699
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:36,400
 performance

1700
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:36,400
 

1701
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:39,040
 so the next factor is about the attitude

1702
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:39,040
 

1703
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,640
 attitude is how we think or perceive the

1704
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,640
 

1705
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,880
 events around us

1706
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,880
 

1707
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:45,440
 so we know that we have positive

1708
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:45,440
 

1709
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,599
 emotions and negative emotions

1710
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:47,599
 

1711
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,280
 um or having the positive attitude or

1712
00:35:47,589 --> 00:35:49,280
 

1713
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:52,240
 negative attitude

1714
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:52,240
 

1715
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:54,240
 positive attitude is more about seeing

1716
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:54,240
 

1717
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:57,280
 everything positive around us

1718
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:57,280
 

1719
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,880
 so we are all in um similar situations

1720
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:58,880
 

1721
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:02,000
 in our workplace

1722
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:02,000
 

1723
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,119
 but some people try to learn from every

1724
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:03,119
 

1725
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,240
 situation

1726
00:36:03,109 --> 00:36:06,240
 

1727
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:09,359
 you always think about the learning and

1728
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:09,359
 

1729
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,800
 positive emotions also widen over a span

1730
00:36:09,349 --> 00:36:10,800
 

1731
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:14,079
 of attention

1732
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:14,079
 

1733
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:17,359
 but if we are having a negative attitude

1734
00:36:14,069 --> 00:36:17,359
 

1735
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:20,640
 we criticize the situation uh which will

1736
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:20,640
 

1737
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:23,359
 uh block our learning ability

1738
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:23,359
 

1739
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:25,839
 the alternative to that would be having

1740
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:25,839
 

1741
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:28,560
 the growth mindset and in agile world we

1742
00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:28,560
 

1743
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:31,599
 talk about growth mindset a lot

1744
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:31,599
 

1745
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:35,280
 growth mindset is all about having an

1746
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:35,280
 

1747
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:38,960
 open mind open-mindedness towards

1748
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:38,960
 

1749
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,320
 learning new things um be open for the

1750
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:40,320
 

1751
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,400
 change

1752
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:42,400
 

1753
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,320
 look for the possibilities where we

1754
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:44,320
 

1755
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,920
 learn from challenges and negative

1756
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:45,920
 

1757
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:49,040
 experiences

1758
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:49,040
 

1759
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:52,240
 so many organizations um help

1760
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:52,240
 

1761
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,880
 by having the internal coaches or life

1762
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:52,880

 who actually look into helping people

1766

 maintaining their attitude or their

1768

 emotions

1770
00:37:00,069 --> 00:37:03,280

 organizations are also spending

1899
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:35,040
 which looked into people's brain who eat

1907
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,880
 brain plasticity is better in the people

1908
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,880

1929
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,800
 absorb the learning so even if you get

1930
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:10,800
 

1931
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,359
 um

1932
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:13,359

1937
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,800
 stressed you won't be able to learn

1938
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:18,800
 

1939
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,319
 anything if you try to learn you won't

 why we are talking about all this

1950
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:30,560
 

1951
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:33,920
 because um

1952
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:33,920
 

1953
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:36,960
 uh in organizations all the

1954
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:36,960
 

1955
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:39,440
 hr's or leaders they just look into

1956

1957
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,800
 what kind of uh training programs to

1958

00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:46,240
 um how we can actually do some

1962
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:46,240
 

1963
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,319
 communities of practice but at the same

1964
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:48,319
 

1965
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:50,240
 time we need to look into what kind of

1966
00:40:48,309 --> 00:40:50,240
 

1967
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:51,680
 culture and environment we should

1968
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,680
 

1969
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:54,720
 provide to people

 so that they can learn

1972
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:58,000

 food all the time now

1976
00:40:59,349 --> 00:41:02,079

 yeah those studies they have applied to

1982
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:08,000
 

1983
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,000

00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:14,319
 

1989
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:16,079
 if you're vegetarian or you eat meat

1990
00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:16,079

 these factors

2006
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:35,359
 

2007
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,800
 what you think you can use in your

2008
00:41:35,349 --> 00:41:36,800
 

2009
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:40,560
 organization

2010
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:40,560
 

2011
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:41,119
 um so we will go into uh some breakout

2012
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:41,119
 

2013
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,680
 rooms

2014
00:41:41,109 --> 00:41:43,680
 

2015
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:45,119
 for 10 minutes i will let maria to

2016
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,119
 

2017
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:48,400
 explain the activity

2018
00:41:45,109 --> 00:41:48,400
 

2019
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:49,599
 and i will share the links for each team

2020
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:49,599
 

2021
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,839

00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,280
 because one of the things is

2222
00:46:03,109 --> 00:46:05,280
 

2223
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:07,280

2231
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,520
 afternoon and then we got into a

2232
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:15,520
 

2233
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,200
 discussion about what would be the best

2234
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:17,200
 

2235
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,800
 time to pick you know just after lunch

 at a time when there's not a lot a lot

2240
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:22,400
 

2241
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:26,839
 of stress that distracts you or

2242
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:26,839
 

2243
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:28,319

2251
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:35,200
 strongly believe it should come from

2252
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:35,200
 

2253
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:38,240
 above

2254
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:38,240
 

2255
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:41,599
 us and it should be driven from top down

2256
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:41,599
 

2257
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:45,040
 um otherwise we're always going

2258
00:46:41,589 --> 00:46:45,040
 

2259
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:49,200
 to have other fires to fight and this

2260
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:49,200
 

2261
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:51,119
 always falls by the wayside always

2262
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:51,119
 

2263
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:53,760
 yeah we need the support to build the

2264
00:46:51,109 --> 00:46:53,760
 

2265
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:55,680
 right culture and get the flexibility

2266
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:55,680
 

2267
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:58,319
 uh but we can always go to the

2268
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:58,319
 

2269
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:01,520
 management and share the ideas

2270
00:46:58,309 --> 00:47:01,520
 

2271
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:03,440
 exactly we have yeah yeah and then

2272
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:03,440
 

2273
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:05,359
 and and that takes us back to the

2274
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:05,359
 

2275
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,119
 definition of learning organizations

2276
00:47:05,349 --> 00:47:07,119
 

2277
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:09,200
 right when we were saying that it's not

2278
00:47:07,109 --> 00:47:09,200
 

2279
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:12,240
 only about that single individual

2280
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:12,240
 

2281
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:14,079
 is about leadership to ensure that they

2282
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:14,079
 

2283
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,960
 have the right environment for that to

2284
00:47:14,069 --> 00:47:14,960
 

2285
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:18,640
 happen

2286
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:18,640
 

2287
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:22,240
 okay okay um

2288
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:22,240
 

2289
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:25,839
 can we move to team two does anyone want

2290
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:25,839
 

2291
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:25,839
 to share

2292
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:33,670
 

2293
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:39,839

2294
00:47:40,069 --> 00:47:40,069
 

2295
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:44,319
 uh so yeah team two we uh we actually

2296
00:47:42,309 --> 00:47:44,319
 

2297
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:47,280
 were discussing and we ran out of time

2298
00:47:44,309 --> 00:47:47,280
 

2299
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:48,000
 but we did uh discuss some scenarios on

2300
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:48,000
 

2301
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:51,040
 uh

2302
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:51,040
 

2303
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,280
 the problems we uh come across uh one

2304
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:53,280
 

2305
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:55,839
 was the not enough time

2306
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:55,839
 

2307
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,800
 to uh invest in learning the the project

2308
00:47:55,829 --> 00:47:56,800
 

2309
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:58,880
 deadlines

2310
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:58,880
 

2311
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,400
 and the release timelines that everyone

2312
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:00,400
 

2313
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:04,160
 struggles with

2314
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:04,160
 

2315
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:06,400
 uh one area of improvement was uh

2316
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:06,400
 

2317
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,760
 maybe investing and getting more lead

2318
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:07,760
 

2319
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,559
 time with the teams while doing the

2320
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:08,559
 

2321
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,960
 planning

2322
00:48:08,549 --> 00:48:10,960
 

2323
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:11,760
 in executing the agile environment could

2324
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:11,760
 

2325
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:15,119
 help

2326
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:15,119
 

2327
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:16,800
 um how we could get better is um

2328
00:48:15,109 --> 00:48:16,800
 

2329
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:18,720
 it's more about transforming the whole

2330
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:18,720
 

2331
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,960
 uh organization culture

2332
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:20,960
 

2333
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:22,400
 that could promote and thrive learning

2334
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:22,400
 

2335
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:25,200
 uh through allocating time

2336
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:25,200
 

2337
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,160
 for learning and sharing another aspect

2338
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:26,160
 

2339
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,559
 could be including

2340
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:28,559
 

2341
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:30,319
 learning as part of the performance uh

2342
00:48:28,549 --> 00:48:30,319
 

2343
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:31,760
 for example some companies like google

2344
00:48:30,309 --> 00:48:31,760
 

2345
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:35,040
 and some of the r d companies here in

2346
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:35,040
 

2347
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:37,520
 toronto also what they do is they invest

2348
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:37,520
 

2349
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:39,200
 let's say 20 of the time 25 of the time

2350
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:39,200
 

2351
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,559
 for each resource into their own

2352
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:40,559
 

2353
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,920
 personal learning they can do their own

2354
00:48:40,549 --> 00:48:41,920
 

2355
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:44,240
 personal projects

2356
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:44,240
 

2357
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,640
 and then they could come up with the

2358
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:46,640
 

2359
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:47,920
 presentation or some some demos and then

2360
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:47,920
 

2361
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,920
 share with the team

2362
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:49,920
 

2363
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,359
 so it's uh not only about personal

2364
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:51,359
 

2365
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,280
 learning but when they shared

2366
00:48:51,349 --> 00:48:53,280
 

2367
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:54,800
 it's about sharing that knowledge with

2368
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:54,800
 

2369
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,880
 the whole organization

2370
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:56,880
 

2371
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,880
 what the it results with is that it

2372
00:48:56,870 --> 00:48:58,880
 

2373
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:02,559
 motivates everyone else as well for

2374
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:02,559

00:50:12,549 --> 00:50:14,880
 

2429
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:15,839
 spatial distance and from being able to

2430
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:15,839
 

2431
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:19,200

2435
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,559
 some ideas shared were about um feeling

2436
00:50:21,829 --> 00:50:22,559
 

2437
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:26,079
 like you're

2439
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:27,839
 uh kind of within a six block radius and

2440
00:50:26,069 --> 00:50:27,839
 

2441
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:29,359
 not having the opportunity to share

2442
00:50:27,829 --> 00:50:29,359
 

2443
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:33,359
 learning opportunities

00:50:29,349 --> 00:50:33,359
 

2445
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:36,880
 and also within a workday because

2446
00:50:33,349 --> 00:50:36,880
 

2447
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:40,480
 you're not typically

2451
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:46,559
 that's having the organization provide

2452
00:50:43,589 --> 00:50:46,559
 

2453
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:47,920
 times where you can have a break to put

2454
00:50:46,549 --> 00:50:47,920
 

2455
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:50,559
 toward work and

2456
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:50,559

2461
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,359
 in the past that was something that an

2462
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:55,359
 

2463
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:58,880
 organization offered so

2466
00:50:58,870 --> 00:51:02,319
 

2467
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:04,880
 scheduling and enablement of time is

2468
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,880
 

2469
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:05,920
 something that is can be leveraged and

2470
00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:05,920

2481
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:23,839
 team four which is our last team

2482
00:51:25,829 --> 00:51:25,829
 

2483
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:29,760

2487
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:39,760
 pretty much it's the same theme going

2488
00:51:37,109 --> 00:51:39,760
 

2489
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:42,000
 around from team one to team four

2490
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:42,000
 

2491
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,520
 it's consistent pretty much that it's

2492
00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:43,520
 

2493
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:47,119
 lack of time

2494
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:47,119
 

2495
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:49,200
 um for not just for learning but

2496
00:51:47,109 --> 00:51:49,200
 

2497
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:50,319
 overall lack of time that we are

2498
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:50,319
 

2499
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:53,440
 experiencing

2500
00:51:50,309 --> 00:51:53,440
 

2501
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:56,319
 especially with um

2502
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:56,319

00:51:56,319 --> 00:52:00,640
 there's there have been times

2506
00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:00,640
 

2507
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:03,119
 or most of the time if i may say that

2508
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:03,119
 

2509
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:06,240
 way that we've been experiencing

2510
00:52:03,109 --> 00:52:06,240
 

2511
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:08,400

2512
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:08,400
 

2513
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,680
 just just enough time to grab your lunch

2514
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:09,680
 

2515
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:12,480
 from from you know

2516
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:12,480
 

2517
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:13,200
 from your kitchen or warming it up and

2518
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:13,200
 

2519
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,680
 uh

2520
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:15,680
 

2521
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,880
 that you know that just doesn't leave

2522
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:16,880
 

2523
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:19,920
 enough time for

2524
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:19,920
 

2525
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:23,359
 everything else including learning so

2526
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:23,359
 

2527
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:26,240
 uh apart from um other

2528
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:26,240
 

2529
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:27,200
 suggestions that um teams have already

2530
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:27,200
 

2531
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:30,960
 given

2532
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:30,960
 

2533
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:32,160
 um you know blocking time is already

2534
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:32,160
 

2535
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:35,359
 covered i think everything

2536
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:35,359
 

2537
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:36,319
 pretty much was covered uh however one

2538
00:52:35,349 --> 00:52:36,319
 

2539
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:39,760
 of the main thing

2540
00:52:36,309 --> 00:52:39,760
 

2541
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:42,400
 is that uh especially

2542
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:42,400
 

2543
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,880
 your direct people manager should be

2544
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:42,880
 

2545
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:47,359
 made

2546
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:47,359
 

2547
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:50,720
 more responsible uh for considering

2548
00:52:47,349 --> 00:52:50,720
 

2549
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:53,359
 um you know considering uh

2550
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:53,359
 

2551
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:54,160
 and providing you opportunities for for

2552
00:52:53,349 --> 00:52:54,160
 

2553
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:57,040
 learning

2554
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:57,040
 

2555
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,440
 and it could be support in any any shape

2556
00:52:57,030 --> 00:52:57,440
 

2557
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,240
 or

2558
00:52:57,430 --> 00:53:00,240
 

2559
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:01,359
 form depending on the individual and

2560
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:01,359
 

2561
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:03,119
 they should be

2562
00:53:01,349 --> 00:53:03,119
 

2563
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:04,559
 made more responsible rather than oh

2564
00:53:03,109 --> 00:53:04,559
 

2565
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:06,480
 yeah you should be learning

2566
00:53:04,549 --> 00:53:06,480
 

2567
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:07,680
 so and so get the certificate that

2568
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:07,680
 

2569
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,440
 certificate

2570
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:09,440
 

2571
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:11,440
 and we are good to go it should not be

2572
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:11,440
 

2573
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:13,680
 just very vague

2574
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:13,680
 

2575
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,800
 at that at that level and that would

2576
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:14,800
 

2577
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:18,319
 help not just in

2578
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:18,319
 

2579
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:19,760
 overall enrichment of all the employees

2580
00:53:18,309 --> 00:53:19,760
 

2581
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:21,359
 uh it would actually help the

2582
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:21,359
 

2583
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:25,040
 organization by

2584
00:53:21,349 --> 00:53:25,040
 

2585
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:28,559
 retention of the talent um

2586
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:28,559
 

2587
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:31,839
 and and because people will feel

2588
00:53:28,549 --> 00:53:31,839
 

2589
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:35,280

2591
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:37,040
 um and that

2592
00:53:35,270 --> 00:53:37,040
 

2593
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:40,000
 that they are important they me they'll

2594
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:40,000
 

2595
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:40,000
 be felt

2596
00:53:40,829 --> 00:53:40,829
 

2597
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:44,400
 valued

2598
00:53:42,069 --> 00:53:44,400
 

2599
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:46,000
 is an excellent idea and you're

2600
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:46,000
 

2601
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,559
 absolutely right time to time the

2602
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:48,559
 

2603
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:51,680
 managers they just go and say

2604
00:53:48,549 --> 00:53:51,680

 maybe is i think the

2608
00:53:55,109 --> 00:53:58,160
 

2609
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:59,760

00:53:58,150 --> 00:53:59,760
 

2611
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:03,280

00:54:06,549 --> 00:54:08,160
 

2619
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:10,240
 by taking this training why are you

2620
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:10,240
 

2621
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:14,079
 pursuing with this and

2622
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:14,079
 

2623
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:15,359
 in why how that can benefit the

2624
00:54:14,069 --> 00:54:15,359
 

2625
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:19,040
 organization as well

2626
00:54:15,349 --> 00:54:19,040
 

2627
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:20,640
 if the plan is for this employee to stay

2628
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:20,640
 

2629
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:22,800
 in there so

2630
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:22,800
 

2631
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:24,240
 there are different factors and these

2632
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:24,240
 

2633
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:27,359
 are very unique to the

2634
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:27,359
 

2635
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:30,480
 individual so i don't see

2636
00:54:27,349 --> 00:54:30,480
 

2637
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:30,960
 in in this is a very common issue is

2638
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:30,960
 

2639
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,559
 that

2640
00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:32,559
 

2641
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,000
 people just send the entire group the

2642
00:54:32,549 --> 00:54:34,000
 

2643
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:36,079
 manager sends the entire group to a

2644
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:36,079
 

2645
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,359
 specific training but maybe someone in

2646
00:54:36,069 --> 00:54:37,359
 

2647
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:39,280
