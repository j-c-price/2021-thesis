8
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:31,750
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Now, this
is how we left on Tuesday.

9
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:36,820
We got to this point where we
had put a particle in a box.

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,860
We put a quantum mechanical
particle in a box.

11
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,400
And it was an
infinite square well.

12
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,404
And what's this called?

13
00:00:44,404 --> 00:00:45,568
AUDIENCE: Energy levels.

14
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:47,360
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Energy
levels, and what's

15
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,262
really weird about them?

16
00:00:49,262 --> 00:00:50,720
AUDIENCE: They're discrete.

17
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,680
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah, meaning
if you have this one here

18
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,540
and then you have
another energy here,

19
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,670
can it have energy in between?

20
00:00:58,670 --> 00:00:59,493
No.

21
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:01,160
Can that quantum
particle be in between?

22
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,880
No, in energy.

23
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,970
And so the question
was, can we connect that

24
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,550
to things like what we
see in the universe,

25
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,140
like the spectral lines?

26
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,795
So what I want to do--

27
00:01:10,795 --> 00:01:12,170
there's a little
bit more we need

28
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,240
to do to do that connection.

29
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,440
And so I want to spend some time
today just going through that

30
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,650
and going to the hydrogen
atom, because this is not

31
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:22,400
the hydrogen atom.

32
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,990
It's not an infinite well.

33
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:28,160
And then from the
hydrogen atom, we'll

34
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,820
talk about how just
from that, just

35
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,800
by solving for
the hydrogen atom,

36
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,430
we literally have this
incredibly deep understanding

37
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,870
of the entire periodic
table and all of chemistry.

38
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,930
So it's a pretty
powerful thing to do.

39
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,530
So we're going to start
with a little bit of review,

40
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:49,032
and then this
real-world example.

41
00:01:49,032 --> 00:01:50,990
And then I've got to tell
you a few things that

42
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:54,230
are really important, like you
have this thing called "spin."

43
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,520
So we'll talk about that.

44
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,290
We'll end with that, and talk
about how from this solution,

45
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,490
you get this--

46
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,870
pretty awesome, pretty amazing.

47
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:09,340
So some review-- so we went
through this on Tuesday.

48
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:14,320
So why did people even
need quantum mechanics?

49
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,530
Well, because things were
failing, and crumbling,

50
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,070
and catastrophing
all around them.

51
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,110
And so how long--

52
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:28,850
so classical atom, oh, no,
there's a classical atom.

53
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,620
Photoelectric effect
was one of them.

54
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:35,050
Who can explain
what happened here?

55
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,450
These are some of the
reasons why we needed

56
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:41,913
a new theory after 400 years.

57
00:02:41,913 --> 00:02:43,830
What's going on with the
photoelectric effect?

58
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,780
Anyone remember?

59
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,490
Yeah.

60
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:59,013
AUDIENCE: A description of the
phenomenon or why it happened?

61
00:02:59,013 --> 00:02:59,930
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yes.

62
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,680
AUDIENCE: OK, so basically,
you take some light.

63
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,320
You shine it at a metal, and
a bunch of electrons come off.

64
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,560
And if you increase the
intensity of the light,

65
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,090
the number of
electrons coming off

66
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,710
increases, but not
the energy, which

67
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,490
was sort of counterintuitive.

68
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,490
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Why was
that counterintuitive?

69
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,670
AUDIENCE: Because if
light's not a particle,

70
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:21,670
it's just like a
wave, then you expect

71
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:24,260
if you're shooting more light
at it, that's more energy.

72
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,920
So if an electron gets
hit by a bunch of light,

73
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,230
you'd think it would
get a bunch of energy,

74
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,750
and you'd also get a higher
energy, but it doesn't.

75
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,840
And the solution
was that the photons

76
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,970
are produced by electrons
changing energy levels

77
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,330
or something like that.

78
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:41,445
And so they come in
discrete packets of energy.

79
00:03:41,445 --> 00:03:42,820
And so when they
hit an electron,

80
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,800
they shoot it off at
some particular energy.

81
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,470
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
And what's that?

82
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,210
AUDIENCE: It's
frequency dependent.

83
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,950
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: It's just
dependent on the frequency,

84
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:48,545
exactly.

85
00:03:48,545 --> 00:03:49,420
That's exactly right.

86
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,920
So does everybody see that?

87
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,440
So this was called the
"photoelectric effect."

88
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,750
And it was the reason Einstein
was given the Nobel Prize.

89
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,840
It's a very
important explanation

90
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,832
of this very confusing
effect, which

91
00:04:03,832 --> 00:04:05,290
is that you increase
the intensity,

92
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,075
but the energy of
those electrons--

93
00:04:07,075 --> 00:04:07,950
see what's happening?

94
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,575
You're shining light on a piece
of metal and electrons fly off.

95
00:04:10,575 --> 00:04:13,840
And you can measure how much
energy those electrons have.

96
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,520
And you increase the
intensity of light,

97
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,130
and they don't have any more
energy, which was really

98
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,410
bizarre if light is a wave.

99
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:24,130
What Einstein said
is, no, actually, oh,

100
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,990
but it does depend on the
frequency of the light.

101
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:30,590
So that makes sense if
light can be considered

102
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:34,500
as particles of zero mass--

103
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,490
that's weird-- that have
an energy associated

104
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,960
with their frequency.

105
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,240
So that was really important.

106
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,160
The energy of
something you thought

107
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,850
was a wave, light,
actually can be considered

108
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,220
as a particle associated
with the frequency,

109
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,310
have the energy of a particle
associated with that frequency.

110
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,320
And then what was
the classical atom?

111
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,010
What's wrong with this one?

112
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:02,800
How long do we live
in a classical world?

113
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,086
What's the most we could
live in a classical world?

114
00:05:05,086 --> 00:05:06,790
AUDIENCE: 10 to the
minus 12 seconds.

115
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:09,460
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: 10 to the
minus 12 seconds, it's game

116
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,000
over.

117
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,750
Why?

118
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,735
What's happening?

119
00:05:13,735 --> 00:05:16,433
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

120
00:05:16,433 --> 00:05:17,350
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Why?

121
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,058
What's happening?

122
00:05:18,058 --> 00:05:19,940
So it's accelerating,
and we know

123
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,250
that an accelerating charge--

124
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,248
radiation, and it loses energy.

125
00:05:25,248 --> 00:05:27,290
And if it loses energy,
it should just spiral in,

126
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:30,570
and that takes about 10
to the minus 12 seconds.

127
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,720
So we know that's
not true, either.

128
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,910
Actually, I wanted to
put this out there.

129
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:40,590
This is from Wikipedia, and it's
a sort of explanation of that.

130
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,770
And so if you want to
understand more and read more

131
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:45,380
about the classical
atom, get a book

132
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,245
on Lienard-Wiechert potentials.

133
00:05:48,245 --> 00:05:50,120
I'm sure just the name
alone is inspiring you

134
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,870
guys to want to dig deep.

135
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,160
And those are the ones.

136
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,310
That's what you can do to
get the time-varying EM

137
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:01,100
field for a point charge
in arbitrary motion.

138
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,840
But look at that--
they're not corrected

139
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,132
for quantum mechanical effects.

140
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,710
So that's what was
such a problem.

141
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:12,310
This was right around 1900.

142
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:15,670
So they had it, but then they
tried to apply it to an atom,

143
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,300
and here's what happens.

144
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,457
It's accurate, but breaks
down at the quantum level.

145
00:06:21,457 --> 00:06:23,290
Quantum mechanics sets
important constraints

146
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:26,800
on the ability of a particle
to emit radiation, i.e.,

147
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,040
it doesn't in an atom.

148
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,850
Sometimes, I think this is
kind of interesting to look at.

149
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:37,060
Basically, we have this
problem that an atom will

150
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,888
sort of self-destruct, and the
electrons just spiral down.

151
00:06:39,888 --> 00:06:41,680
The solution really,
if you think about it,

152
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,920
is it doesn't do that anymore.

153
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,030
But now why?

154
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:51,320
Well, because of the fact that
particles are waves and waves

155
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,070
are particles.

156
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,900
And it comes from
the quantization.

157
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:59,930
So I want to make sure
that we're all on that page

158
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,120
by the end of today, that
we all kind of see that.

159
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,900
So that's the reason,
is because particles can

160
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:10,130
be both waves and particles.

161
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,440
Waves can be waves
and particles.

162
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,610
Everything is one happy family.

163
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,350
Can't we all just get along?

164
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,750
Here are some particles
going through slits.

165
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,860
Now what's happening here?

166
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,590
Actually, you can think
of this as a particle

167
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:31,540
or it kind of looks like
a water wave, doesn't it?

168
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,160
But see, that's the whole point.

169
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,630
That's what particles are.

170
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,360
So what's happening here?

171
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,090
Can somebody explain
why it's showing this?

172
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:44,810
What's going on?

173
00:07:47,612 --> 00:07:51,876
We've got on the
left, how many slits?

174
00:07:51,876 --> 00:07:52,630
AUDIENCE: One.

175
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:52,990
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
And on the right?

176
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:53,770
AUDIENCE: Two.

177
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:56,170
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
What's the difference?

178
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:57,280
AUDIENCE: Interference.

179
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,480
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yes.

180
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,300
What's interference?

181
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,008
AUDIENCE: Two different
waves, and you've

182
00:08:03,008 --> 00:08:03,925
got peaks and troughs.

183
00:08:03,925 --> 00:08:06,730
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah, so that
you get two waves coming out

184
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:12,190
of-- but look, the same particle
creates no interference here

185
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,030
because it just bubbles through.

186
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:19,210
But if you have two slits, it
can create two little waves.

187
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:22,430
And those interfere and
they cause complex behavior.

188
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:25,658
And that is what
blew people away.

189
00:08:25,658 --> 00:08:27,700
And oh, by the way, you
can see that there's also

190
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,283
some really cool
interference going on

191
00:08:29,283 --> 00:08:31,282
in the backscattering
from the edges,

192
00:08:31,282 --> 00:08:32,740
because you get a
little scattering

193
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,880
off the edges on both cases.

194
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,669
But what we're looking at is
what's happening over here.

195
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:40,169
And so it's just really weird
that you could throw particles

196
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:42,600
through slits, and they
were like water waves,

197
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,890
not like particles.

198
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:49,680
That was another really
bizarre experiment.

199
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,660
And again, one of the big,
important stepping stones

200
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,290
was the fact that you
could describe the energy

201
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,940
of a particle by its frequency.

202
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:06,180
And then de Broglie came and
said, actually, not just light.

203
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,300
No, everything-- all matter--

204
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,550
can be considered as both
a particle and a wave.

205
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,760
This is stuff we
talked about Tuesday.

206
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,330
And so what that means is
that I have a wavelength.

207
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:21,560
What's my wavelength?

208
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,290
35, 10 to the minus 35.

209
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:25,940
But I'm OK with that.

210
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:30,560
I feel that quantum
is right here.

211
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,030
I feel it somewhere within.

212
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:39,710
But see, when things are really
small like an electron, which

213
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:42,320
is this part of the class--
we care about those electrons.

214
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,040
And I motivated that on Tuesday,
and we'll come back to that

215
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,120
as we go through examples.

216
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,570
So if I want to know
about an electron,

217
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,190
that's a really small thing.

218
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:56,450
And so its wavelength-- and
we talked about this Tuesday--

219
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:59,570
the wavelength associated
with the particle

220
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:03,500
is about the same
size as the distances

221
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,480
the particle sort of
goes out for a walk

222
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:10,010
on, on a daily basis, otherwise
known as its "chemical bond."

223
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,960
If you're an electron,
you kind of walk

224
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,090
along this chemical bond.

225
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:20,390
That's sort of what you do, if
you're in a bonding situation.

226
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:24,170
And that distance of that
walk is roughly the same

227
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:27,800
as your wavelength,
as your wave nature.

228
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:33,370
Your wave nature-ness
is important then.

229
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,770
And so because of that,
we can't describe it

230
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,060
without quantum mechanics.

231
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,590
You have to have a
way of describing it.

232
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:44,060
And it has to be something
that is based on a wave.

233
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,980
So that's the breakthrough.

234
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,620
And I'll go through
that again just quickly.

235
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:58,550
But what we came out with is the
fact that particles are waves.

236
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,800
So they have wave functions.

237
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,740
And this wave function is
what we'll be solving for.

238
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,050
This is what we want in
this part of the class.

239
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:06,920
We want that.

240
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,560
And so it'll have some form.

241
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,170
And we showed a few forms,
and I'll show you more today.

242
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:17,480
But we showed a few for
a particle in a box.

243
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:24,350
That had a cosine, and then
it had one node in the middle.

244
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,730
But what's amazing about this
is that this has no meaning

245
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,060
we know of.

246
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,340
We do not understand
what this means.

247
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:38,000
So you have this
intimate function

248
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,800
that describes the
particle, and we

249
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,940
don't know how to interpret it.

250
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:48,710
The big breakthrough came
in making the connection

251
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:54,080
that the square of that
function is meaningful.

252
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,310
But that's pretty cool.

253
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:58,100
So think about if
I had a position.

254
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,430
Wait, you had this--

255
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:02,000
you did classical
molecular dynamics,

256
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,100
so you have the position
of the particle.

257
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,740
That's a function of time.

258
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,560
Imagine saying that
that has no meaning,

259
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,100
or you don't know what it
means, only the square of it.

260
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,110
So something as
fundamental as the wave

261
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:18,810
itself that is the solution
to the equation to our f

262
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:22,290
equals ma, which is Schrodinger,
something as fundamental

263
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,720
as that, we don't
know what it means.

264
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,400
But we do know what
its square means.

265
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,760
And what does the square mean?

266
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,960
AUDIENCE: Probability.

267
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,210
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Probability.

268
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:34,416
So tell me a little
more about that.

269
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,840
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

270
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,870
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah, so tell
me-- this is a particle right

271
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:40,370
here.

272
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:42,920
You're starting to
see it, I can tell.

273
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,540
I can see that you're
starting to see it.

274
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:49,220
I can feel the excitement
about this, too, in the room.

275
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,570
It's tangible.

276
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,220
This is a particle.

277
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,640
You see this now not as a
wave, not as a particle.

278
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,350
You see it as both.

279
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,942
Now, if this is a
particle and that's

280
00:12:58,942 --> 00:13:01,400
why I'm going to show you a
little video on it in a second.

281
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,400
But if this is a
particle, where is it?

282
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,697
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
by chance [INAUDIBLE]..

283
00:13:07,697 --> 00:13:09,530
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: But
I mean, I know that it

284
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:11,860
can be a particle again.

285
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,222
We it can go back and forth.

286
00:13:13,222 --> 00:13:15,680
That's what it did when you
sent it through the two slits--

287
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,050
it became wave, then
it became a particle.

288
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:23,400
So can I say that
it's spread out?

289
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,210
Is it spread out?

290
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,540
How do I interpret that?

291
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,378
AUDIENCE: The probability
of finding a particle is

292
00:13:35,378 --> 00:13:37,112
2 to the negative 3.

293
00:13:37,112 --> 00:13:38,070
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Good.

294
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:43,880
That's sort of the way
that I like to look at it.

295
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,500
I mean, the particle is--

296
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,830
in a way, you can think
about it is spread out

297
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,750
until you measure it.

298
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:55,160
It's sort of everywhere in here,
because there's no here here.

299
00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:00,430
There's only a certain amount
of chance to be here here.

300
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:03,520
So I have a kind of big chance,
if I measure where it is,

301
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,930
of finding it here.

302
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:08,230
And then I have no chance
of finding it here.

303
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,660
And then it's sort of medium
chance here, and a big chance

304
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:13,370
there, if I measure it.

305
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:16,720
So that's really what
these functions mean.

306
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,750
And those functions
are the ones that we

307
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:23,060
solve for to find out
where electrons are.

308
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,180
And where those
electrons are is what

309
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:29,750
is absolutely critical to
doing a whole lot of material

310
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,270
science, as I
mentioned on Tuesday,

311
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:38,570
and as we'll talk about when
we apply this to problems.

312
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,070
And that's what you get.

313
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:45,560
You get bizarre distributions
of probabilities.

314
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:49,760
Here's an electron thrown
into a wall that is infinite,

315
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,110
and here is an electron thrown
into a wall that's finite.

316
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:56,240
So that's my quantum
mechanical ball.

317
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,620
Did I show this Tuesday?

318
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,870
I don't think I did.

319
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,550
So if it's thrown
into an infinite wall,

320
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,900
it actually can't go through.

321
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,610
The probability--
we worked this out.

322
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,920
If you have an infinite
boundary here--

323
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,110
we talked about that Tuesday--

324
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,300
you can't have any function.

325
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,860
The only solution is 0.

326
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,117
So it can't penetrate at all.

327
00:15:14,117 --> 00:15:15,950
So it completely bounces
back, although look

328
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:18,950
at the weird things it
does when it bounces back.

329
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:22,910
That's the wave function of
a ball thrown into a wall,

330
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:30,110
or if you want, an electron
thrown into a material.

331
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:32,660
But over here, you
see it's not infinite,

332
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,540
and all kinds of
interesting things happen.

333
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,420
It does bounce back in a
similar way, but some of it

334
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,218
goes through.

335
00:15:39,218 --> 00:15:40,010
What's that called?

336
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,500
AUDIENCE: Tunneling.

337
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,672
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Tunneling, right.

338
00:15:45,672 --> 00:15:47,130
And you better
believe that this is

339
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:52,180
as effect we use in
technology all the time--

340
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:57,660
tunneling of charges,
very important.

341
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:01,050
If I take my macroscopic
ball and I throw it,

342
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:06,340
or if I just run myself with
a helmet on into the wall,

343
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,770
how much of me is
going to tunnel?

344
00:16:11,662 --> 00:16:13,808
AUDIENCE: Not enough.

345
00:16:13,808 --> 00:16:15,850
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: What is
enough in that example?

346
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,840
So why aren't I tunneling
if I run into that wall?

347
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

348
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:26,262
AUDIENCE: You're not
running fast enough.

349
00:16:26,262 --> 00:16:27,720
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
I'm not running--

350
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,310
so actually, that's true.

351
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,570
I'm pretty slow.

352
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:40,210
But the thing is that
there's another reason.

353
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:44,890
What is it about me that
is really different here?

354
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:45,870
AUDIENCE: You're big.

355
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:48,710
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: I'm big,
and so what does that mean?

356
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:49,490
What's small?

357
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,020
AUDIENCE: Your wavelength.

358
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,790
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
My wave function--

359
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,920
my wavelength, not
my wave function.

360
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,430
My wave function is everywhere,
but it just doesn't really

361
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:59,900
spread out that much.

362
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:05,690
Because the wavelength of
me is 10 to minus 35 meters,

363
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:08,869
and remember, when
quantum matters

364
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:12,920
is when your wavelength is sort
of on the same scale roughly

365
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,920
as the stuff you're
involved with.

366
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,109
And I'm involved with a thing
that's a meter over there.

367
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:22,579
So if I'm 35 orders of magnitude
smaller in my wavelength,

368
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:25,280
there's not going to
be any quantum effects.

369
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,430
You won't tunnel very often, not
enough to make it worth trying.

370
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:37,800
Now, here's the goofy
video, which is kind of fun.

371
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,311
So I'll just play it,
and then we'll move on.

372
00:17:40,311 --> 00:17:40,936
[VIDEO PLAYING]

373
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:41,561
[MUSIC PLAYING]

374
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:42,320
I love the music.

375
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,045
- A true giant of
quantum revolution

376
00:17:44,045 --> 00:17:48,070
was Werner Heisenberg.

377
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,935
And from the vagueness of
positions of electrons and de

378
00:17:50,935 --> 00:17:54,460
Beuys standing wave orbits,
he drew a tremendous insight,

379
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:58,260
which he stated like this--

380
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,890
"The more precisely the
position is determined,

381
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:08,100
the less precisely the momentum
is known, and vice versa."

382
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,740
And while it may seem like
a bunch of gobbledygook,

383
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:14,310
it was the insight necessary
to understand how an object can

384
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,350
be both a particle and a wave.

385
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,840
This single statement
led to the understanding

386
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,320
that subatomic particles
can disappear and reappear

387
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,028
in another place.

388
00:18:27,028 --> 00:18:28,612
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
That's really weird.

389
00:18:28,612 --> 00:18:30,400
- And they can do
this without existing

390
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,960
in the intervening space.

391
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,760
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
That's really weird.

392
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,650
- When an electron is
trapped inside an atom,

393
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,080
the places it can
disappear and reappear

394
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,465
include specific locations
around the nucleus.

395
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,000
And that makes it
look like a shell.

396
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,990
Basic particles can also be in
more than one place at a time,

397
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,310
if the time is brief enough.

398
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,740
An electron can travel
from here to there

399
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,930
along all possible
paths simultaneously.

400
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:12,800
And even more astounding,
these particles

401
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,510
can appear out of the
nothingness of space,

402
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:21,640
exist for an extremely brief
instant, and then disappear.

403
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,150
Scientists call them
"virtual particles."

404
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:31,240
They may be virtual, but they
can have very real effects.

405
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,640
All this jumping around
makes particle descriptions

406
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,210
so inexact.

407
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:41,870
But then existence itself is
inexact at these tiny scales.

408
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:48,560
The question is
often asked, what

409
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,570
is it that is wave
when a particle is

410
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:51,620
described as a wave?

411
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:57,430
And after a lot of
hem-hawing around the issue,

412
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:02,810
the right answer is,
existence is waving.

413
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,260
The particles are
jumping around,

414
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:08,840
coming into and
out of existence.

415
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,750
And those places where the
wave crests are maximum,

416
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,570
are the places where the
particle materializes

417
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:18,160
most of the time,
while the places where

418
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:24,090
the crests are minimum are the
places the particle avoids.

419
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:28,250
The wave is a map of the
particles' existence.

420
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:31,450
And as the wave changes, the
particle changes as well.

421

[END PLAYBACK]

422
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,482
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: There you go.

423
00:20:36,482 --> 00:20:38,880
I love these kinds of
videos, and not just

424
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,730
for the soundtracks, because
those are pretty cool.

425
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:46,260
But I think that he
got a little bit ahead

426
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:50,520
of where I want to be, but does
everybody see that weirdness?

427
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,760
Is everybody getting
a feel for it?

428
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:57,410
OK, he said something
that's mind blowing.

429
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:00,710
What did he say that I
said was really deep.

430
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,078
Anybody remember?

431
00:21:02,078 --> 00:21:03,757
AUDIENCE: Existence is waving.

432
00:21:03,757 --> 00:21:05,090
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Existence is--

433
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:05,720
well, yeah.

434
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,450
Oh, actually, there
were so many things.

435
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:10,820
You're going to have
to see this again.

436
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,520
And again, this is one of those
things-- you take this with Dr.

437
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,620
Quantum, was it Dr. Quantum?

438
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,420
You take this video
with you, too--

439
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:21,620
to the bars, to the dorms,
wherever you're going

440
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,540
to do your next social thing.

441
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:26,820
And you just see
what the response is.

442
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:31,580
You ask what their opinion
is, and it's a great way

443
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,630
to engage with people.

444
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:34,130
Yeah.

445
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:37,050
AUDIENCE: Does the wave
function exist all the time?

446
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:38,050
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Sorry?

447
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:41,600
AUDIENCE: Does the wave function
exist all the time, too?

448
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,010
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: That
is a good question.

449
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,240
And yes.

450
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,420
I mean, it's changing
all the time,

451
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,857
but it exists all the time.

452
00:21:49,857 --> 00:21:51,440
Here's the thing,
though-- did anybody

453
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,313
catch the other thing
that's going on here?

454
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:55,230
I'm going to talk about
this at the end today.

455
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:55,872
But--

456
00:21:55,872 --> 00:21:57,290
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

457
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:59,870
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: OK, yeah,
I can't even go there,

458
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,280
that's so crazy.

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,620

00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,930
Yeah.

JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Vertical
particles, vacuum fluctuations,

463
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,610
but we're not going
there either--

464
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:12,930
mind blowing.

465
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:15,680
I mean, in quantum mechanics,
stuff actually appears out

466
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,060
of nowhere.

467
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,190
Out of nothing
you get something,

468
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,660
and then it disappears.

469
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,610
Those are called
"vacuum fluctuations."

470
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:23,300
What else?

471
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,920
But it's all related to this.

472
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,220
Basically what he
said is that particles

473
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:31,830
can disappear and then
reappear somewhere else.

474
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:35,520
And actually, if you
take field theory,

475
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,110
which I really don't
recommend for most people--

476
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:41,810
I still remember my final
exam in field theory.

477
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:43,950
It was 90 pages long.

478
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,470
It was a 24-hour,
take-home exam.

479
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,110
Anyway, I still remember
asking my field theory teacher

480
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:57,580
in graduate school,
how can that be?

481
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,590
How can a particle disappear?

482
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,840
Because basically when
you get down to it,

483
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,300
that's pretty much
how things move

484
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,340
at the very smallest scales.

485
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,320
They disappear and
then they reappear.

486
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,570
That's what the math
tells us, at least.

487
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:12,537
How can that be?

488
00:23:12,537 --> 00:23:13,495
I didn't get an answer.

489
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:18,072
This gets deep.

490
00:23:18,072 --> 00:23:19,780
It's really cool and
really mind blowing.

491
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,100
And we just don't really know.

492
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,910
We don't connect it so much
anymore in the classrooms

493
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:28,670
to the mind-blowing
awesomeness of it all.

494
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:30,400
But I love it.

495
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,650
Now, I'll get to
that towards the end.

496
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,230
I'll come back to that.

497
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:39,970
Now, what we need-- so
we have these waves.

498
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:42,495
We know that particles are
waves and waves are particles.

499
00:23:42,495 --> 00:23:43,870
And we know that
the particles we

500
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:45,400
care about in this
part of the class

501
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,950
are going to have to
be described by a wave.

502
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:51,640
How do we talk-- what's the
F equals ma of that wave?

503
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,640
It's dictated by-- it's
the Schrodinger equation.

504
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,990
That's it.

505
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:57,610
That's our f equals ma.

506
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:00,100
It's telling us how
this wave is going

507
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:03,770
to change in time and space.

508
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:04,990
And so we talked about that.

509
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:08,860
And we basically
just wrote this down

510
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,280
and said this is the equation.

511
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,510
We're not going to go into the
details of where it comes from,

512
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:17,710
but there's so many places where
you can read more about that.

513
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:20,627
But this is our
governing equation.

514
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:22,210
And basically, what
you have is a kind

515
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,820
of kinetic energy of the wave.

516
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:28,000
That's this del squared thing,
kinetic energy operator,

517
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,260
and a potential.

518
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:33,220
And that together, we call
h, we call the Hamiltonian.

519
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,340
That's got its own
special name because just

520
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:40,450
like T plus V in classical
physics is the energy,

521
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:45,940
we consider this thing, h
squared over 2m del squared

522
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,770
plus V to be the energy.

523
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,810
That's h.

524
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:51,940
But it has to act
on the wave function

525
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,320
in order to get that energy.

526
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,780
And that's basically what
the Schrodinger equation is.

527
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,370
Because we said,
we're going to say

528
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:00,040
that h doesn't depend
on time usually,

529
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,555
for the things we care about.

530
00:25:01,555 --> 00:25:02,930
And if it doesn't
depend on time,

531
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:06,010
then we can get
rid of the t here,

532
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:08,350
and we could separate
the time dependence out,

533
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:10,090
which is what we do.

534
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:13,750
And we're left
with H psi equals E

535
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:16,660
psi, which is the
equation we need to solve.

536
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,440
And I'll come back
to it in a second.

537
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,440
Here's the bit on
Schrodinger I mentioned

538
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,980
that I think is amazing.

539
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,970
This is, again, from Wikipedia.

540
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:28,600
You see, he found
the standing waves.

541
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,360
See, there it is.

542
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,530
He found the standing waves
of this relativistic equation,

543
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,390
but the relativistic
corrections disagreed

544
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:35,590
with Sommerfeld's formula.

545
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:38,230
Discouraged, he put
away his calculations

546
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:40,960
and secluded himself
in an isolated mountain

547
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,930
cabin with a lover.

548
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:45,220
I find it amazing--

549
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:50,770
not that part, but I find it
amazing that seriously, he

550
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:52,300
had to be convinced.

551
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,670
See, he came back
from the cabin and he

552
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:57,790
decided that his earlier
calculations were novel enough

553
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,140
to publish.

554
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,900
It's a good thing,
because it's pretty much

555
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:06,070
one of the most important
equations of the last century.

556
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:10,360
And it's the equation
we will be solving.

557
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,720
That's why I think this
history is interesting.

558
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,660
OK, so there it is.

559
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:18,100
So we talked about how
you can take the f out,

560
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,430
because if H doesn't
depend on time, then

561
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:24,780
you can just set them
equal to a constant.

562
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:27,630
You can set each side
having its own function

563
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:30,870
dependent on its own variable,
r and t in this case,

564
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,070
and they equal a constant.

565
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,918
And then you get the Schrodinger
equation we care about,

566
00:26:34,918 --> 00:26:36,960
which is the one we'll be
solving, which is H psi

567
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,800
equals E psi.

568
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,520
And then we did this,
and we said, well,

569
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,250
how do you solve it?

570
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:48,740
What if you have a very
simple particle in a box.

571
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:52,720
And the box's walls
go up to infinity.

572
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,040
Then you can solve it.

573
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,810
And it's because
you have basically

574
00:26:55,810 --> 00:27:00,030
the particle is either
between 0 and L, in which case

575
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:05,740
here, then v is 0, and
so you get this equation,

576
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:11,290
or it's out here in this
region, in which case

577
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:14,110
V is infinity, which
means psi has to be 0.

578
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:16,550
That's the only solution.

579
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,970
And then this is the
interesting part.

580
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,470
And when you look at this, you
see that the general solution

581
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:23,630
is sines and cosines.

582
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:26,540
So we did that, but then there
was the very important thing

583
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,210
that happened.

584
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:29,110
What is it?

585
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:34,095
And you get a solution
for E. Once you

586
00:27:34,095 --> 00:27:36,220
say the general solution,
you get a solution for E.

587
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,320
So this is just a
standing wave, and you

588
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,470
get a solution for E,
which depends on k squared.

589
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:43,916
But what's really
important that we did next?

590
00:27:43,916 --> 00:27:45,245
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

591
00:27:45,245 --> 00:27:46,620
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
And that does--

592
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,360
yes, and what did that do?

593
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,320
AUDIENCE: It quantizes.

594
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,780
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Quantizes.

595
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:54,690
Once you have the
boundary conditions,

596
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:58,330
it limits what this can be.

597
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:01,000
We didn't limit it until
we applied the boundary

598
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,500
conditions.

599
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,170
Then we applied the boundary
conditions and boom,

600
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:07,020
this thing is quantized,
and out from that

601
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,690
drops such a relief
for the world,

602
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:13,670
which can exist for more than
10 to the minus 12 seconds.

603
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:18,140
Because that quantization
is, in fact, the answer.

604
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:21,905
It's that those electrons can
only be at certain energies.

605
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:29,480
They cannot radiate energy
off of the atom and spiral

606
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:33,080
to the middle because they can't
be at another energy except

607
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,820
the one it's in, and
then the next one.

608
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:38,780
And it's real.

609
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:41,360
I think I may have
shown this on Tuesday--

610
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,680
that you can actually
visualize the spatial extent

611
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,440
of the orbitals.

612
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,380
And I put some more--

613
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,120
this is actually
cutting-edge research.

614
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:53,370
Visualizing the shape of
electrons is not easy,

615
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:54,450
but it can be done.

616
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:58,160
There's been some really
phenomenal breakthrough

617
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:58,700
experiments.

618
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:02,900
This was in Scientific
American a decade ago.

619
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:09,010
Now I want to move from
particle in a box to real stuff.

620
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:11,770
And the first real
stuff that's relevant

621
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:15,490
is hydrogen. And it's
only one element,

622
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:19,570
and I mentioned last time
that it's not necessarily

623
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:24,190
useful enough to do, say,
materials engineering.

624
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:26,110
And so you'd like to
have a little bit more

625
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,520
of the periodic table.

626
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,630
That's true, but you'll see
that with hydrogen alone,

627
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,788
we get our answers
to so many questions

628
00:29:33,788 --> 00:29:35,080
about the whole periodic table.

629
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,503
And it is a real
useful material.

630
00:29:39,503 --> 00:29:42,170
How much of the universe is made
of hydrogen, does anybody know?

631
00:29:44,876 --> 00:29:47,425
AUDIENCE: 70?

632
00:29:47,425 --> 00:29:49,300
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: That's
a really good guess.

633
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,580
It's about 75%.

634
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:54,030
That's a lot of hydrogen.
Now, how much of that

635
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:58,613
is in usable form on Earth
for the hydrogen economy?

636
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:11,920
How much hydrogen is usable
for hydrogen-powered cars

637
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,550
on this planet right now,
in an immediate form?

638
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,140
Zero.

639
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,920
That's part one of the
hydrogen economy problem.

640
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,900
You've got to make the hydrogen.

641
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,070
There isn't any more.

642
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,090
It's too light.

643
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:32,370
This planet's gravity
couldn't hold it.

644
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:36,590
So anything that was free, left
or bonded to something else.

645
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:39,500
You've got to make
the hydrogen. What's

646
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,510
part two of the hydrogen
economy problem?

647
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,410
Storing it.

648
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:48,470
So you've got two big problems
with the hydrogen economy.

649
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:51,290
I'm not saying it's
not worth looking at.

650
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:56,780
We will not be driving
around this way,

651
00:30:56,780 --> 00:31:00,800
but I'll talk a little bit
more about hydrogen. I just

652
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,160
love motivating the topic
we're about to go into.

653
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:07,460
And since I want to talk
about the hydrogen atom,

654
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:10,625
I will talk a little more about
hydrogen storage materials.

655
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:12,500
And we will calculate
some properties of them

656
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,410
using quantum mechanics.

657
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:16,430
But I love this.

658
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:18,660
The history of hydrogen
is a very interesting one,

659
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,930
but I love going
back to Jules Verne.

660
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:25,130
In 1874, Jules Verne
said, "I believe

661
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:27,170
that one day hydrogen and
oxygen, which together

662
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:28,760
form water, will be
used either alone

663
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:32,750
or together as an inexhaustible
source of heat and light."

664
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,010
I love that.

665
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:37,590
Anyway, we're not
there, not even close.

666
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:41,560
I think a hydrogen
economy is a possibility.

667
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,700
And I think there's some
great research going on.

668
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:49,240
And it should stay as research
for at least another 30,

669
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:49,860
40 years.

670
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,910
I'll come back to--

671
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,040
it's going to need
about that much research

672
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:58,390
to really make an impact
in the energy scene.

673
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:01,520
I'll come back to that later.

674
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:06,890
So that's a little motivation
for hydrogen. Now here it is.

675
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:10,270
Hydrogen has a
proton, an electron,

676
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:14,830
and it's got some distance
that that electron sits away

677
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:17,070
from the proton.

678
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,690
What do I need to know?

679
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:25,300
Well, I need to
know the potential.

680
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:28,420
So what's the potential here
between these two charges?

681
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,920
One's negative, one's positive.

682
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,880
They feel an attraction.

683
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,600
How does it go with r?

684
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,770
Yeah.

685
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:39,960
It goes as 1 over r.

686
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:46,140
So now that-- I got my
V. It's the potential

687
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,550
that charges feel.

688
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:50,940
And that's got to go now into
the Schrodinger equation, which

689
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:51,990
I then need to solve.

690
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:57,870
And that'll tell me what the
possible wave functions are.

691
00:32:57,870 --> 00:32:59,550
And so here's what
it looks like, see?

692
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:01,410
We had H psi equals E psi.

693
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:03,570
That's our master equation.

694
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:06,690
Then we said, that's the
kinetic plus potential.

695
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:09,900
And then we said, that's
the momentum term, remember,

696
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:13,630
we talked about Tuesday, which
is just a second derivative.

697
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,100
It's a second
partial derivative.

698
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,390
It's a del squared, and plus
this potential term, which

699
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:23,970
I now put in here explicitly
for the hydrogen atom, E

700
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:26,780
squared over 4 pi epsilon 0 r.

701
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:30,090
And that's the question
I need to solve.

702
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:35,260
And it turns out that you
can solve this exactly.

703
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,170
You can solve this
exactly, just like you

704
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:41,170
could the particle in the box
with the infinite boundaries.

705
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:43,620
And that's really cool.

706
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,520
So you've got an electron.

707
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:49,370
You've got one particle,
just one electron.

708
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:51,410
These are its
spatial coordinates.

709
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:53,510
And you can solve for
it in this potential,

710
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:56,810
in this 1 over r
potential exactly.

711
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:59,690
And the easy way to do that
is to switch it to spherical

712
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:00,700
coordinates.

713
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,620
So I won't go through
the math in detail.

714
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:07,790
There's literally like 100
sites and 50 Wolfram Alpha apps

715
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:11,090
you can look at that
go through this,

716
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:14,960
and really, really
wonderful material on this.

717
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,800
But basically, the key point
is that when you write it

718
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:23,239
in spherical coordinates,
you switch from XYZ Cartesian

719
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:27,080
to spherical coordinates, you
can actually separate this

720
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:35,929
into essentially three quantized
problems-- theta, r, and phi.

721
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:40,130
And so you can write psi
now as a function of the r

722
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:42,830
and a function of the theta
and a function of the phi.

723
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:46,175
And what ends up happening--
and then so you put that in.

724
00:34:46,175 --> 00:34:47,550
And there's a
little bit of math.

725
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:48,949
It's actually not that much.

726
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:51,031
I'm not going to go through it.

727
00:34:51,031 --> 00:34:52,489
But you put that
in, and basically,

728
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:55,850
just like that
particle in the box,

729
00:34:55,850 --> 00:35:01,420
just like that, each one of
these variables gets quantized.

730
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:05,620
It gets its own
sort of E-type term,

731
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:09,160
and it gets a quantization.

732
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:12,190
So these are the
equations that it

733
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:15,350
leads to when you do the
separation of variables.

734
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:20,740
And I think I have-- yes,
and the quantization is--

735
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:23,590
I think maybe on the next page
I have the actual energies.

736
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:26,140
But the solution--
remember, just

737
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:28,720
like the quantization of a
particle in a box, the same

738
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,410
here.

739
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:32,710
It only can happen, you
can only have a solution,

740
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,420
if in this case,
we're going to have

741
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:39,070
a quantum number called n is 1,
2, 3, or something else going

742
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:39,670
up.

743
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:42,370
Or in this case, we'll have
a quantum number called l.

744
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:44,800
That's also, by the way,
the main quantum number,

745
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,850
the orbital quantum number, and
then we have this little m sub

746
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:49,960
l, which is the magnetic one.

747
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,790
How many of you
have not seen these?

748
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:55,020
So you've all seen these?

749
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,050
How many of you have seen this?

750
00:35:57,050 --> 00:36:00,050
OK, so I'm glad to see
all the hands go up.

751
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:04,850
And so that's what you have.

752
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:07,130
And it's a very special case.

753
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:09,660
And how many of you remember
that s stands for "sharp?"

754
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,180
See, I forget that.

755
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:15,510
Seriously, did you all
remember this sharp principle

756
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,740
and diffuse?

757
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:20,440
And I love f, which
is "fundamental."

758
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:27,540
So I want to know what's not
fundamental about silicon,

759
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:31,030
which has no f electrons?

760
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:34,180
Anyway, I thought that
was an interesting label.

761
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:39,160
So this is how we designate,
from these quantum numbers,

762
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,950
which come from just solving
the Schrodinger equation for one

763
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:44,830
electron in a 1 over
r potential-- that's

764
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:46,720
how we get all of
these designations

765
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,140
that you're used to--
s orbitals, p orbitals.

766
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:53,770
And you see, you get
different wave functions.

767
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:59,630
You get these functions,
these same wiggly functions

768
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,720
that I've been showing you.

769
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,155
You get four different values
of these quantum numbers.

770
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:11,930
And those functions can
be plotted in space.

771
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:16,580
This is just given those
spherical coordinates

772
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:19,490
and the functions of
those, you can plot them.

773
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:23,180
And you see that they
make really funny shapes.

774
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:31,740
Why is this so important?

775
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,810
I said it on Tuesday.

776
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:36,925
Why is the funniness of
those shapes important?

777
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:43,110
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

778
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:45,732
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah,
because what am I looking at?

779
00:37:45,732 --> 00:37:47,190
Actually, let's go
to the next one.

780
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,510
That's kind of fun.

781
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:50,250
What am I looking at here?

782
00:37:50,250 --> 00:38:00,920
This is the 1s orbital of
hydrogen, 2s orbital, 3s, 4s.

783
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,020
Look at how they're all spheres.

784
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:05,430
They're all
spherically symmetric.

785
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:10,560
And then you go 2p
orbital and you see

786
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,580
that it has a different shape.

787
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:17,760
So its function, these
are wave functions.

788
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,830
Remember, the wave function
is-- what's the wave function?

789
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,050
Who knows?

790
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:33,835
Does any of you know?

791
00:38:33,835 --> 00:38:38,170
If anybody has some ideas,
this is like an open problem,

792
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:41,010
an open discussion.

793
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:42,510
But what is interesting
about these?

794
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:44,190
So these are the wave functions.

795
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:46,176
From that, what can I get?

796
00:38:46,176 --> 00:38:47,490
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

797
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:49,260
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Yeah, if I do what?

798
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,093
AUDIENCE: Square it.

799
00:38:50,093 --> 00:38:51,810
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Square it.

800
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:57,410
So these landscapes
squared tell me what?

801
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,370
Where the electron is.

802
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:08,170
And that is
incredibly important.

803
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:11,680
That's it-- where
is that electron?

804
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:17,160
Well, if you are fundamental
as opposed to diffuse,

805
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:21,330
you have some really bizarre
places you can be and not be.

806
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,460
You can't be anywhere
where this isn't.

807
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,200
That's the point.

808
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,290
It's a probability distribution.

809
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:36,200
It dictates-- basically, all
the behavior of materials

810
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,590
comes from these,
these distributions.

811
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:44,330
They dictate what
materials do and become.

812
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:47,000
Now in the hydrogen atom--

813
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,750
so what happens?

814
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:53,220
So you get these
shapes of the size,

815
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,710
and then you also get those E's.

816
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:58,500
And remember, we solved
for the E's and then

817
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:03,340
we put the boundary conditions
on, and then it was quantized.

818
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:15,710
And the quantization in hydrogen
can be calculated exactly.

819
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:18,170
So the quantization of the
energy levels in hydrogen

820
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:21,513
is exactly minus
13.6 over n squared,

821
00:40:21,513 --> 00:40:23,180
where n is the principle
quantum number.

822
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,850
How many of you have seen this?

823
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:28,900
Sort of half.

824
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:32,140
So 13.6 eV over n squared
is the quantization.

825
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:38,960
That means the energy of an
electron in this first orbital,

826
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,590
that one up there, if I put
an electron in that orbital,

827
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:50,342
its energy is bound to
the atom by 13.6 eV.

828
00:40:50,342 --> 00:40:51,300
So what does that mean?

829
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,640
Yeah.

830
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:59,112
AUDIENCE: If you give it 13.6 eV
or greater, it'll become free.

831
00:40:59,112 --> 00:41:00,070
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah.

832
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:03,850
That's the ionization
energy of that electron.

833
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:07,630
But hydrogen has all
of these other orbitals

834
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,830
accessible to it.

835
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:13,000
Maybe I could put an
electron up to another level,

836
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,060
like the 2s level.

837
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:20,560
And if I do that, it's
all the way up to 3.4.

838
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,260
So now it's only bound
by 3.4 eV in the atom.

839
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,960
And what does that make it?

840
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:35,410
Is it sort of less
stable, more stable?

841
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:36,327
AUDIENCE: Less stable.

842
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,577
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Less stable.

843
00:41:37,577 --> 00:41:39,408
So it'd be much more
easy to pull it off.

844
00:41:39,408 --> 00:41:41,950
Now, do you think that that has
something to do with bonding?

845
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:47,950
You better believe it.

846
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:55,060
Where electrons sit in energy
relative to other electrons

847
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:57,760
in other atoms, or
in their own atom,

848
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,850
has everything to do with
how things bond together.

849
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:04,800
And that bonding is
the one that you've

850
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:09,140
been just fitting to like
a Lennard-Jones potential.

851
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,400
You've just been fitting it.

852
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,400
All that bonding is what you
just-- in classical physics,

853
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:18,650
in classical modeling, you have
to have some potential form.

854
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:20,930
And all of the
intricacies of the bonding

855
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:22,370
get swept up into that.

856
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:24,410
But you can see why
that's so much more

857
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:29,090
complicated than that,
just by looking at these.

858
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:32,840
OK, but now, that
series that we just

859
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:37,340
got from a simple particle
in 1 over r potential

860
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:43,550
explains all of these
levels that are observed.

861
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:45,950
So does everybody remember this?

862
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:50,570
And poor number six
who didn't get named?

863
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:51,540
What are these?

864
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:58,630
When you see these, what
does it make you think?

865
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:06,110
Spectral-- now explain what's
happening in the Lymann series.

866
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:07,140
What's happening?

867
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:09,765
AUDIENCE: You're moving from one
orbital down to the ground one

868
00:43:09,765 --> 00:43:12,075
and it's emitting photons
at those wavelengths.

869
00:43:12,075 --> 00:43:13,950
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: And
why are they different?

870
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:17,270
Why do I have all these
different ones in one series?

871
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:19,974
AUDIENCE: The amount of energy
it gives off as it goes from n

872
00:43:19,974 --> 00:43:22,980
equals 7 to n equals 1 is
different from n equals 2 to n

873
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:23,480
equals 1.

874
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,020
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah, exactly.

875
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:27,590
And if you go up to
2 and you stop at 2,

876
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:29,720
then you have other energies.

877
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:33,620
Because it all comes down to,
then, what the differences are.

878
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:36,680
To get an electron to
go from here to here,

879
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,870
you need the difference
in these energies.

880
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:41,270
And to go from here to here,
you need that difference.

881
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:44,520
No more and no less will do.

882
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:48,420
Now, when the electron comes
back down, what happens?

883
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:55,438
Anybody know what happens?

884
00:43:55,438 --> 00:43:56,480
AUDIENCE: It emits light.

885
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,855
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
It emits light.

886
00:43:57,855 --> 00:43:59,870
It gives that energy
back out as light.

887
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:01,940
And that's what you
see when you look out

888
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,500
at these spectral lines.

889
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:07,360
So it emits light at
exactly this energy.

890
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,460
Can it emit light
at something else,

891
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:12,430
at a different amount of energy,
or a different frequency?

892
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:15,640
Because we know for
light, the energy

893
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:20,350
is equal to the frequency
times a constant.

894
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:23,435
Can it emit light
at this frequency,

895
00:44:23,435 --> 00:44:24,310
something in between?

896
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:24,810
Why not?

897
00:44:28,224 --> 00:44:29,210
AUDIENCE: Quantized.

898
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:32,660
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Yeah, it just can't

899
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:38,600
because it's a wave
problem that has

900
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:42,540
as its solution quantization.

901
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:46,320
And now, I come to the question
of, well then how does--

902
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,730
so that's what's happening.

903
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:50,425
That's the picture of these
electrons coming back down,

904
00:44:50,425 --> 00:44:52,050
and emitting different
colors of light.

905
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:55,620
It explains what
people saw and couldn't

906
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:57,660
understand for so long.

907
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:00,900
This simple solution,
mathematical solution,

908
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:01,800
does it all.

909
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:06,660
It really crystallized
what was going on,

910
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,760
and it really confirmed
that this is the right way

911
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,920
to picture things--

912
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:14,790
the wave equation and
the Schrodinger equation.

913
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:17,160
Now, what's happening when
an electron goes from here

914
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,750
to here?

915
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:21,980
How does it do that?

916
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:28,400
It cannot go in between, but
we know it does do this all

917
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,310
the time.

918
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:31,935
We just look out in space and we
see it happening all the time,

919
00:45:31,935 --> 00:45:33,240
but we can do it here.

920
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:37,910
We can build materials
that do this for a living.

921
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:43,760
Where are those electrons
going when they go from the 2p

922
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,690
to the 1s?

923
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:47,940
Where are they going?

924
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,640
Who can tell me?

925
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,722
Yeah.

926
00:45:55,722 --> 00:45:58,180
AUDIENCE: They're all sort of
described by a wave function,

927
00:45:58,180 --> 00:45:58,680
right?

928
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,700
So it has some
non-zero probability

929
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:03,432
to be in one place and
a non-zero probability

930
00:46:03,432 --> 00:46:04,390
to be in another place.

931
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:06,700
And if you hit it with
a photon or something,

932
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:09,223
or have some perturbation
to your hydrogen atom,

933
00:46:09,223 --> 00:46:11,140
then it's going to have
a non-zero probability

934
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:13,700
to be in one electron
energy level than another.

935
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:17,087
And so it just sort of ends
up falling into one of them.

936
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,670
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
That actually works.

937
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:23,142
That is a great interpretation
of what's happening.

938
00:46:23,142 --> 00:46:25,600
And that actually works, and
it even works all the way down

939
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,260
to the nucleus.

940
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:30,250
By the way, decay to
the nucleus is possible

941
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:33,400
because those s orbitals--

942
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:36,670
I was just showing you a
slice of them, an isosurface.

943
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:40,420
But they have a non-zero
magnitude all the way down

944
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:41,290
to the nucleus.

945
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:46,450
It just won't happen very often,
because the probability is

946
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:52,840
so low that it's why
we have a universe.

947
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:57,190
If that overlap was more,
if the wave function

948
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:58,390
going into the middle--

949
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:08,270
if this is the nucleus
and this is the electron,

950
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:13,340
and the wave function of the
s orbital looks like this,

951
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:21,830
and it's almost 0, that's
why we are alive today.

952
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:28,090
But if this looks more like
this, no, we wouldn't make it.

953
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:30,610
There's just too much
probability for the electron

954
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:35,140
to decay into the nucleus, and
give off that amount of energy,

955
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:37,150
and the atom collapses.

956
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:44,375
So we should be very thankful
to quantum mechanics.

957
00:47:44,375 --> 00:47:47,660
Now, there are
situations, though,

958
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:52,300
when you actually
have nodes in between.

959
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:54,340
And that's a tougher one.

960
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:56,550
The node means the wave
function goes exactly to 0.

961
00:47:56,550 --> 00:48:00,240
Now what's happening?

962
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,820
And here, we go
back to this world

963
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:06,480
of particles, this field
theory world, basically, of how

964
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:10,260
particles move, by essentially
annihilating themselves

965
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:12,590
and reappearing.

966
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:15,910
That's how electrons
really move.

967
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:19,030
Now any questions
about any of that?

968
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,970
No questions at all?

969
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:31,920
OK, we're going to
start taking this

970
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,280
to the next level,
which is obviously going

971
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,713
to have to be more complexity.

972
00:48:38,713 --> 00:48:40,880
There are some constants
that I'm just putting here.

973
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,470
I'm not going to
spend any time on it,

974
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:44,120
but these are the
constants you'll

975
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:46,580
be using in the quantum world.

976
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:49,310
We have an electron
volt. We have a Rydberg,

977
00:48:49,310 --> 00:48:51,620
which is 13.6 electron volts.

978
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:53,370
And just to make it
interesting, there's

979
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:57,200
a Hartree, which
is a half of that.

980
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:01,090
And then the same with
angstroms and Bohr.

981
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:02,680
These are the kinds of unit--

982
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,110
do you say angstrom,
do you say Bohr--

983
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:09,190
to-may-to, to-mah-to--
you can choose, but just

984
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:11,700
keep track of it all.

985
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:13,720
Now, as we go to more complex--

986
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:17,670
so I've given you a
particle in a box,

987
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:20,490
and then I gave you a
particle, actually, on Tuesday,

988
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:22,140
in an oscillator.

989
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:25,270
And then I give you a
particle in 1 over r.

990
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:26,800
And that got us a long way.

991
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,060
We explained spectral lines.

992
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:30,520
We got hydrogen right.

993
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,770
But if I just add a little
bit more complexity,

994
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:36,060
you see things get really messy.

995
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:38,280
Now, this was a problem.

996
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:41,550
I wanted to show
how messy things get

997
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:47,340
with analytic solutions as a
kind of motivational exercise.

998
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:48,870
So I gave this on
a homework problem

999
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:51,610
in this class two years ago.

1000
00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:57,600
And I'll admit that
was probably a mistake.

1001
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:04,260
I had a lot of people at
office hours, because you see,

1002
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:05,220
this is the same thing.

1003
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,050
I'm throwing my
quantum mechanical ball

1004
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:09,090
into a wall that has
another wall behind it.

1005
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,840
So can't you just set it up?

1006
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,370
Well, sure, you can.

1007
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:17,860
And this is what you get.

1008
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:21,130
And you put that
into Mathematica,

1009
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:24,370
which every single student
did, and it chokes--

1010
00:50:24,370 --> 00:50:25,960
can't do it.

1011
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,190
Too many for Matlab.

1012
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,440
I guess too many boundary
conditions, or too many

1013
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:34,540
variables, or
something, but nobody

1014
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:37,000
could get Mathematica
to do this without

1015
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,340
some intelligent substitution
of variables first,

1016
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:40,660
which was sort of the trick.

1017
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:44,380
But my point in this was
not to make students suffer.

1018
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:46,510
I don't like to do
that, but it was just

1019
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:48,430
to convey how hard
this equation gets

1020
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:53,050
to solve with just a little
bit more complexity than one

1021
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:57,400
particle in a well or in 1
over r, or something like that.

1022
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:03,510
It gets really hard, and
that's why we need computers.

1023
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:06,690
And that's what computation
in the last 50 years has done.

1024
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:09,780
It has made this, together
with some algorithms,

1025
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:13,080
some simplifications
that you'll hear about--

1026
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:17,250
it has made this
equation solvable

1027
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:20,970
for much more complex systems.

1028
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:23,760
So I can also say,
well, let's not

1029
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,050
make the potential
more complicated.

1030
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:31,800
Let's just add another electron.

1031
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:35,880
So now, I'm still with
a 1 over r potential,

1032
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:38,740
but I've got two of them.

1033
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:41,950
So now, all of a sudden,
my potential term

1034
00:51:41,950 --> 00:51:45,970
is these electrons
interacting with the proton,

1035
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:50,050
but also those electrons
interacting with each other.

1036
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:54,600
That's r12, the distance
between the two electrons.

1037
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,760
And boy, does that
make this equation

1038
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:00,090
hard to solve analytically.

1039
00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:05,650
You cannot use
separation of variables.

1040
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:12,450
So even just one more electron,
it's a deal breaker, basically.

1041
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:15,960
And now you think we
want to do big molecules.

1042
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:17,160
We want to do fullerenes.

1043
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,530
We want to do silicon.

1044
00:52:19,530 --> 00:52:22,450
We want to do
thousands of electrons.

1045
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:24,270
Analytic approaches won't work.

1046
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,380
So what can you do?

1047
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:32,990
Well, there are two
different ways to go.

1048
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:34,760
You've got to do something.

1049
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:39,470
You've got to make it easier,
because as you'll see,

1050
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:43,880
an exact solution, even with
the most powerful computers

1051
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:48,950
in the world times squared
are not going to do it.

1052
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:52,010
You need to make approximations
to the actual equation.

1053
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:55,530
And you'll hear about
those next week.

1054
00:52:55,530 --> 00:52:58,980
And one thing you can do is
you can use perturbation theory

1055
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:03,360
to say that this Hamiltonian
is actually some simpler

1056
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:05,430
Hamiltonian.

1057
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:08,190
That Hamiltonian is
some simpler Hamiltonian

1058
00:53:08,190 --> 00:53:12,300
that you can solve easily
plus some perturbation to it.

1059
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:14,640
We're not going
to really do that.

1060
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:18,070
Has anybody used
perturbation theory?

1061
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:20,280
So we're not going
to do it much but,

1062
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,360
I'm just using it for reference.

1063
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:25,530
And then, so you do
something for something.

1064
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:28,710
Perturbation theory, what you do
is you say, well, that's hard,

1065
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:30,130
so I'm not going to do that.

1066
00:53:30,130 --> 00:53:32,490
But this is actually kind
of related, and it's easy,

1067
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:33,960
and I know how to do this.

1068
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:37,500
So I'll do this and then
add something to it.

1069
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:40,710
That's basically
perturbation theory.

1070
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:43,470
But what we're
going to do is we're

1071
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:48,630
going to try to solve it using
more of a matrix eigenvalue

1072
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:49,330
approach.

1073
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:51,960
And again, we are not going
to go deep into the math here.

1074
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:55,830
And you will not be
tested on the math.

1075
00:53:55,830 --> 00:53:59,250
As I said, my goal here
is to have you guys

1076
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:04,410
applying these equations
to real materials problems.

1077
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:08,160
But I do think that it's useful
to know what's under the hood,

1078
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,440
to know what equations
are being solved

1079
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:12,900
when you press "Simulate."

1080
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:16,440
So you'll hear more
about this, and how

1081
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,740
you go about actually
making these approximations,

1082
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:21,210
making the
approximations you need

1083
00:54:21,210 --> 00:54:27,690
to make in order to get
an eigenvalue problem that

1084
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:29,870
can be solved on a computer.

1085
00:54:29,870 --> 00:54:31,870
There are a couple of
different ways to do that.

1086
00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:33,995
The way that we're going
to settle on in this class

1087
00:54:33,995 --> 00:54:35,827
is density functional theory.

1088
00:54:35,827 --> 00:54:37,410
So we'll talk a
little bit about that.

1089
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:40,050
And again, the only Nobel
Prize in computation

1090
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:42,720
was given for that, the
development of that theory.

1091
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:48,070
Now, there's one more
thing I need to talk about

1092
00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:52,030
before I move to just
a couple of examples

1093
00:54:52,030 --> 00:54:54,850
online that I'd
like to show you.

1094
00:54:54,850 --> 00:54:58,340
And that is that there's
something still missing here.

1095
00:54:58,340 --> 00:55:12,690
So we've got-- let's
see, we've got this 1s.

1096
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:15,270
So now we know where
these things come from.

1097
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,370
We really know where they
come from, the solution

1098
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:18,720
to the hydrogen atom--

1099
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:27,890
2p, 3s, and so on.

1100
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:30,290
And then hydrogen would be what?

1101
00:55:30,290 --> 00:55:31,730
How would I show hydrogen here?

1102
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:36,310
Put an arrow there.

1103
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:39,160
What would helium be?

1104
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,240
One more.

1105
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,190
OK, tell me carbon--

1106
00:55:42,190 --> 00:55:43,590
I like carbon.

1107
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:44,590
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1108
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:46,215
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Carbon is right here.

1109
00:55:46,215 --> 00:55:47,740
It hits me in the
heart every time.

1110
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:49,804
How many more?

1111
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:51,707
AUDIENCE: Four.

1112
00:55:51,707 --> 00:55:53,040
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: And then what?

1113
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:53,767
AUDIENCE: Two up.

1114
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:54,850
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Two up--

1115
00:55:54,850 --> 00:55:57,550
oh, why not like this?

1116
00:55:57,550 --> 00:55:58,050
No?

1117
00:55:58,050 --> 00:56:01,640
It just feels wrong-- exclusion.

1118
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:03,120
Now we're talking.

1119
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:05,760
You guys already kind of
have a feeling for this.

1120
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,660
But actually, you
can have materials

1121
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:10,400
that violate someone's rule.

1122
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,662
Anyone know what
that rule is called?

1123
00:56:12,662 --> 00:56:13,787
AUDIENCE: Pauli exclusions.

1124
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:15,370
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Well, actually, this

1125
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:16,760
doesn't violate
Pauli exclusions.

1126
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:17,570
AUDIENCE: Hund's rule.

1127
00:56:17,570 --> 00:56:19,320
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Hund's rule-- very good,

1128
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:21,800
whoever pulled that one out.

1129
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,150
That was good.

1130
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:26,870
But this is how
carbon usually looks.

1131
00:56:26,870 --> 00:56:28,490
Now, something that
we've done here

1132
00:56:28,490 --> 00:56:31,370
is we've already done what
I'm about to tell you, which

1133
00:56:31,370 --> 00:56:33,290
is we've put spin in there.

1134
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:36,510
We've put those electrons
pointing up or down.

1135
00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:38,390
But we also have
those quantum numbers.

1136
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:40,960
This is n.

1137
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,910
N equals 1.

1138
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:48,970
This is n equals 2, and this
is l equals 0, l equals 0.

1139
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:50,710
And this is p.

1140
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:55,720
So this is n equals
2, l equals 1.

1141
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:59,860
And each one of these is an m.

1142
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:04,710
m equals plus or minus 1 and 0.

1143
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:07,103
So that's why I have three p's.

1144
00:57:07,103 --> 00:57:08,520
So those are those
quantum numbers

1145
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,920
you get from quantizing the
solution to the Schrodinger

1146
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:14,280
equation for an electron
in the 1 over r potential.

1147
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:17,340
But there's this one more thing,
which was also very surprising

1148
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:19,710
at the time, which
is that if you

1149
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:22,230
put a particle, in
this case silver atoms,

1150
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:25,440
if you think about electrons
as charges spinning,

1151
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,987
you should have a reaction
to a magnetic field.

1152
00:57:27,987 --> 00:57:29,445
They should have
a magnetic moment.

1153
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:35,220
But classically, you see, if
you have charged spinning,

1154
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:36,780
you get a magnetic field.

1155
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:41,040
Classically, if you shoot this
through a really large magnet,

1156
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,250
you should just get a whole
range of lines of fields.

1157
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:48,450
But just like the double slit,
it didn't turn out that way.

1158
00:57:48,450 --> 00:57:53,360
You got two dots
instead, only two dots.

1159
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:54,460
And these are very famous.

1160
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:56,290
These are the
Stern-Gerlach experiments,

1161
00:57:56,290 --> 00:57:58,810
which were done all
around the same time they

1162
00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:00,190
were figuring all this out.

1163
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:04,000
And what it showed is that the
spin can only be up or down.

1164
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,850
It can only be two things.

1165
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:12,040
There's only two values for the
spin of an electron, the spin

1166
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:14,200
being the thing that's
causing this thing

1167
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:17,830
to have a magnetic moment
that's causing it to react

1168
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:20,825
to the external magnetic field.

1169
00:58:20,825 --> 00:58:23,260
You should get a line.

1170
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:25,090
You should get all this--

1171
00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:28,900
classically, electrons should
have any spin they want.

1172
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:31,510
I don't know what that
was, but it should be

1173
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:33,400
able to point in any direction.

1174
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:36,040
But no, it can only point
this way or this way.

1175
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:39,170
Now, is an electron
really spinning?

1176
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:43,810
If a charge is spinning,
it has a magnetic moment,

1177
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:45,445
but is an electron
really spinning?

1178
00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:52,320
How does it have
a magnetic moment?

1179
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,420
Let's talk.

1180
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:58,200
That's a really good
one, too, but it does.

1181
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,270
And you think about
it as spinning

1182
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:06,060
because that is our classical
Maxwell sort of ENN framework.

1183
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:07,680
We think about charged spinning.

1184
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:08,310
You've done it.

1185
00:59:08,310 --> 00:59:12,930
You make current go through
a wire, and you get a field.

1186
00:59:16,087 --> 00:59:17,670
And that's why we
use the word "spin."

1187
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:19,530
It's sort of like "orbital."

1188
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:21,810
Should we really be
using the word "orbital?"

1189
00:59:21,810 --> 00:59:25,110
Is this electron orbiting?

1190
00:59:25,110 --> 00:59:27,000
No.

1191
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,950
And that's another
ice-breaking question.

1192
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:32,430
You go to your friend,
and you just say,

1193
00:59:32,430 --> 00:59:36,150
do you think electrons
are really orbiting?

1194
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:37,440
Just like that.

1195
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,290
And see how many people say yes.

1196
00:59:40,290 --> 00:59:43,180
They kind of are
spinning in our minds.

1197
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:48,040
But the spin is up or down
because of those experiments.

1198
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:50,740
Now then, the sort
of end of the story--

1199
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:58,440
so they have a magnetic moment,
and it gives them up and down.

1200
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:01,770
And they can only
be up and down,

1201
01:00:01,770 --> 01:00:04,690
only up and down, two values.

1202
01:00:04,690 --> 01:00:09,850
And so what you have is sort
of a new quantum number.

1203
01:00:09,850 --> 01:00:15,040
You have spin, which is
equal to plus or minus 1.

1204
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:17,890
That's that and that.

1205
01:00:17,890 --> 01:00:19,360
So now each of
these-- and that's

1206
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:21,490
why with these collections
of quantum numbers,

1207
01:00:21,490 --> 01:00:25,900
you can get that many
electrons into those shells.

1208
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:26,790
And I love this.

1209
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:29,998
So somebody said
"Pauli exclusion."

1210
01:00:29,998 --> 01:00:32,290
Somebody tell me what the
Pauli exclusion principle is.

1211
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:35,597
Yes.

1212
01:00:35,597 --> 01:00:37,680
AUDIENCE: Two fermions
can't be in the same state.

1213
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:41,400
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: OK, so two
electrons, we'll just say,

1214
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:44,470
which are fermions, cannot
be in the same state.

1215
01:00:44,470 --> 01:00:47,370
And what do you mean
by the "same state?"

1216
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:53,970
AUDIENCE: That they can be in
sort of the same energy shell

1217
01:00:53,970 --> 01:00:56,880
with the same spin
at the same time.

1218
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,290
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: OK, very good.

1219
01:00:58,290 --> 01:01:00,840
Basically what it means is
they cannot have the exact same

1220
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:01,530
quantum numbers.

1221
01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:09,290
Pauli exclusion says
you cannot do this.

1222
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:12,290
Now, I mentioned you
can violate Hund's rule.

1223
01:01:12,290 --> 01:01:15,410
And you can violate
Hund's rule by having

1224
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:18,230
degenerate orbitals
with the same energy,

1225
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:20,570
and doing it there.

1226
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:21,920
But usually, you don't.

1227
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:25,640
Pauli exclusion is an
incredibly important aspect

1228
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:26,720
of quantum mechanics.

1229
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:30,500
It says that no two
electrons, fermions,

1230
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:32,720
can occupy the same
set of quantum numbers

1231
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:33,830
when you include spin.

1232
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:40,560
That is what gives us literally
the periodic table and all

1233
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:43,920
of chemistry when you add
that to quantum mechanics.

1234
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:49,370
That is what gives us the rest,
that plus the hydrogen atom.

1235
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:51,560
You don't need much
more, except you do.

1236
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:58,880
But I love this letter from
Thomas to Goudsmit in 1926.

1237
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,850
"I think you and
Uhlenbeck"-- because they're

1238
01:02:01,850 --> 01:02:07,580
the ones that discovered
this stuff in working out

1239
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:08,600
the theory--

1240
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:11,030
"have been very lucky to
get your spinning electron

1241
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:14,360
published and talked about
before Pauli heard of it.

1242
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:17,240
It appears that more
than a year ago, Kronig

1243
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,820
believed in the
spinning electron

1244
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:21,320
and worked out something.

1245
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:23,352
The first person he
showed it to was Pauli.

1246
01:02:23,352 --> 01:02:26,450
Pauli ridiculed the
whole thing so much

1247
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:30,110
that the first person became
also the last, and no one else

1248
01:02:30,110 --> 01:02:32,600
heard anything of
it, which all goes

1249
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:35,900
to show that the
infallibility of the deity

1250
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:39,770
does not extend to his
self-styled vicar on Earth."

1251
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:46,140
So Pauli had an
interesting reputation.

1252
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:50,340
But that is amazing to
me, because this is it.

1253
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:53,640
This is one of the foundations
of the Pauli exclusion

1254
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:57,690
principle, so Pauli built
his whole reputation

1255
01:02:57,690 --> 01:03:00,300
and really made an
important contribution

1256
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:02,790
because of what apparently
he didn't really

1257
01:03:02,790 --> 01:03:03,870
believe in at first.

1258
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:06,060
So it goes to show--
keep an open mind.

1259
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:12,660
So that's what we just said,
can't have the same quantum

1260
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:13,620
numbers.

1261
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:16,710
Got to mix up the quantum
numbers, and that's it.

1262
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:18,090
And that is it.

1263
01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:22,290
You see, because now, we had all
these levels from the hydrogen

1264
01:03:22,290 --> 01:03:24,180
atom solution--

1265
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:30,240
an electron a one electron in
a simple 1 over r potential,

1266
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,740
and we got all those levels.

1267
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:35,560
And now all we need
to do is fill them up.

1268
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:39,960
And with the Pauli exclusion
principle, we know the rules.

1269
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:41,760
We know the rules.

1270
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,140
We know we can only
put two electrons here.

1271
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:48,100
We know we can only
put two electrons in s

1272
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:51,130
and six electrons
in p, so eight here.

1273
01:03:51,130 --> 01:03:54,480
We know we can only put
two, six, and how many in d?

1274
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:06,790
10, because n goes from
minus 2 to plus 2, so 5.

1275
01:04:06,790 --> 01:04:08,380
I mean, d has that.

1276
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:13,150
So that's starting to sound
a whole lot like this.

1277
01:04:13,150 --> 01:04:14,190
That's it.

1278
01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:19,320
Essentially, with those
fundamental principles

1279
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:22,350
that were worked out in
the '20s, and the solution

1280
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:24,750
of the hydrogen atom,
you get essentially all

1281
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:26,900
of the periodic table.

1282
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:28,870
It's really powerful.

1283
01:04:28,870 --> 01:04:31,310
It's pretty darn cool.

1284
01:04:31,310 --> 01:04:35,570
And you can connect, as I said,
back to the spectral lines

1285
01:04:35,570 --> 01:04:36,990
and all of that.

1286
01:04:36,990 --> 01:04:41,990
Now, what I want to spend
the last couple of minutes on

1287
01:04:41,990 --> 01:04:48,660
is I wanted to show you-- has
anybody looked at the quantum

1288
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:49,160
part?

1289
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:50,830
You guys are still doing
homework from the last part,

1290
01:04:50,830 --> 01:04:51,330
right?

1291
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:58,590
So on the NanoHUB, there is--

1292
01:04:58,590 --> 01:05:02,848
so you go to the
NanoHUB, and you go to--

1293
01:05:02,848 --> 01:05:04,140
sorry, I should check this out.

1294
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:06,330
There I am.

1295
01:05:06,330 --> 01:05:07,560
That's amazing.

1296
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:12,600
That's a picture from, like,
I won't say how long ago.

1297
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:16,140
That's embarrassing.

1298
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:16,830
So you go.

1299
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:18,790
This is my personal thing.

1300
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:21,120
But anyway, the tool
you want is this one,

1301
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:22,900
and it has a little
star next to it.

1302
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:23,850
That's so exciting.

1303
01:05:23,850 --> 01:05:28,210
It's called the "MIT Atomic
Scale Modeling Toolkit,"

1304
01:05:28,210 --> 01:05:31,910
formerly known as the Berkeley
Atomic Scale Modeling Toolkit,

1305
01:05:31,910 --> 01:05:35,290
because I developed
it at Berkeley.

1306
01:05:35,290 --> 01:05:39,440
So much for that,
but it's now at MIT.

1307
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:42,170
And if you click that,
these are actually

1308
01:05:42,170 --> 01:05:46,750
tools I developed for a class I
made up when I was at Berkeley,

1309
01:05:46,750 --> 01:05:49,480
when I valued
sunshine over science.

1310
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,860
It doesn't say that.

1311
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:55,030
And you can launch it,
and you'll see that--

1312
01:05:55,030 --> 01:05:56,810
and you can rate it a 10.

1313
01:05:56,810 --> 01:05:58,640
Don't rate it anything else.

1314
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:03,260
But please rate it,
or don't rate it.

1315
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:07,800
Everybody is so star driven
these days, number of stars.

1316
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:10,270
What was that?

1317
01:06:10,270 --> 01:06:12,020
There was an NPR piece
the other day about

1318
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:15,500
how there's this whole business,
opportunity sprouting up,

1319
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:18,980
of people who have
companies, where all they do

1320
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:22,100
is they get your number of
stars for your products high.

1321
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:23,827
So they have people
around the world,

1322
01:06:23,827 --> 01:06:25,910
because you've got to do
it from different places,

1323
01:06:25,910 --> 01:06:29,570
and you've got to write
fake reviews of products,

1324
01:06:29,570 --> 01:06:34,070
and have different fake
Google email addresses--

1325
01:06:34,070 --> 01:06:38,870
blowing me away, the
so-called internet.

1326
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:44,620
Now, you look here, and you
see that actually in this MIT

1327
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:47,410
Atomic Scale Modeling Toolkit,
there are many things.

1328
01:06:47,410 --> 01:06:48,340
There are many things.

1329
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:52,660
We will be using
two tools from this,

1330
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:55,130
and both are quantum
mechanical tools.

1331
01:06:55,130 --> 01:06:59,350
One is going to be GAMESS, which
is a quantum chemistry package.

1332
01:06:59,350 --> 01:06:59,870
It's free.

1333
01:06:59,870 --> 01:07:03,790
You can download it and run
it on your laptop, actually.

1334
01:07:03,790 --> 01:07:05,710
And it's for
molecules and atoms.

1335
01:07:05,710 --> 01:07:09,750
And another is going
to be called SIESTA.

1336
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:12,810
So you play games,
you take a siesta.

1337
01:07:12,810 --> 01:07:17,040
And this one, we're going
to use when we do solids.

1338
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:19,733
Both of them are going to
use an approximation called

1339
01:07:19,733 --> 01:07:21,900
"density functional theory"
to solve the Schrodinger

1340
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:24,010
equation for real materials.

1341
01:07:24,010 --> 01:07:26,640
So let's just take, in the
last few minutes of class,

1342
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,200
let's take a look at GAMESS.

1343
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:31,030
And you can see--

1344
01:07:31,030 --> 01:07:34,440
why isn't it letting me-- it's
not letting me scroll down.

1345
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:35,070
Seriously?

1346
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:41,250
Oh, there's my scrollbar there.

1347
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:45,158
OK, so the input is actually
pretty straightforward.

1348
01:07:45,158 --> 01:07:47,450
So you can calculate the
energy or you can optimize it.

1349
01:07:47,450 --> 01:07:50,840
The method is going to be DFT,
Density Functional Theory.

1350
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:53,540
The basis set is something
you'll learn about on Tuesday,

1351
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:57,930
what that is, but pick Medium.

1352
01:07:57,930 --> 01:08:00,450
And then I want to
not have a solvent,

1353
01:08:00,450 --> 01:08:03,650
but I want to plot
these orbitals.

1354
01:08:03,650 --> 01:08:09,830
And then, I think it
disappeared again.

1355
01:08:09,830 --> 01:08:12,840
Don't you guys love the NanoHUB?

1356
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:16,220
It's so bug free.

1357
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:19,310
And now it's not dragging.

1358
01:08:19,310 --> 01:08:19,939
It's great.

1359
01:08:19,939 --> 01:08:22,430
So what you can do
is you can do New,

1360
01:08:22,430 --> 01:08:26,520
and let's do the carbon
atom, my favorite one.

1361
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:27,569
And I'm going to--

1362
01:08:27,569 --> 01:08:30,850
do you guys know
about XYZ coordinates?

1363
01:08:30,850 --> 01:08:33,229
So you put the number of
atoms in the top line.

1364
01:08:33,229 --> 01:08:37,540
You leave the next line blank
or you write whatever you want.

1365
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:40,720
And, well, don't let me see some
of the things you might write.

1366
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:41,529
I don't know.

1367
01:08:41,529 --> 01:08:44,795
And then you put the atoms
with their XYZ positions.

1368
01:08:44,795 --> 01:08:46,420
So carbon is going
to be at the origin,

1369
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:47,830
and we click "Simulate."

1370
01:08:47,830 --> 01:08:48,880
And it's doing it.

1371
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:49,600
That's it.

1372
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:53,620
It just solved the Schrodinger
equation for carbon, something

1373
01:08:53,620 --> 01:08:55,670
you couldn't do for
a million years--

1374
01:08:55,670 --> 01:08:57,010
no, for 50 years--

1375
01:08:57,010 --> 01:08:58,540
analytically.

1376
01:08:58,540 --> 01:09:00,670
And it just did it.

1377
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:07,819
And now it's still
executing a script,

1378
01:09:07,819 --> 01:09:11,529
which is very frustrating.

1379
01:09:11,529 --> 01:09:14,370
Is it this slow for you guys?

1380
01:09:14,370 --> 01:09:17,170
This is one atom.

1381
01:09:17,170 --> 01:09:17,670
Man.

1382
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:24,529
Well, so we go back to here.

1383
01:09:24,529 --> 01:09:26,540
One thing you got
right there is you

1384
01:09:26,540 --> 01:09:30,800
got those energy levels, which
I can't scroll down to look at.

1385
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:40,220
This is so amazingly
frustrating.

1386
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:45,350
So now, what I'm going to
do, since it's not working,

1387
01:09:45,350 --> 01:09:48,420
is I'm going to try it again.

1388
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:53,560
And I'll pick a
different basis, low.

1389
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:54,860
See if that works.

1390
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:59,110
And I just did the Schrodinger
equation for carbon.

1391
01:09:59,110 --> 01:10:02,350
You've got to be kidding me.

1392
01:10:02,350 --> 01:10:05,860
You've got to be kidding me.

1393
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:07,760
Really?

1394
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,080
Seriously?

1395
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:11,130
Let's try a different atom.

1396
01:10:11,130 --> 01:10:12,743
Let's try-- somebody
give me an atom.

1397
01:10:12,743 --> 01:10:13,410
AUDIENCE: Boron.

1398
01:10:13,410 --> 01:10:15,702
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: All right,
this is going to be lucky.

1399
01:10:19,142 --> 01:10:20,100
This is going to do it.

1400
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:25,270
Oh, yeah, It's not
able to do it--

1401
01:10:28,890 --> 01:10:31,690
unbelievable.

1402
01:10:31,690 --> 01:10:34,530
Let me just try one more thing.

1403
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:40,580
I'm going to try
putting two atoms in.

1404
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:41,740
Let's see if that helps.

1405
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:47,810
And we'll optimize it.

1406
01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:50,120
Yeah, now it is a party.

1407
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:58,590
Oh, OK, but did it
give me the orbitals?

1408
01:10:58,590 --> 01:10:59,090
No.

1409
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:03,870
Hang on.

1410
01:11:03,870 --> 01:11:05,890
Sorry, guys.

1411
01:11:05,890 --> 01:11:07,620
Oh, it's still here.

1412
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:19,200
Let's just see if it
gave me the orbitals.

1413
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:20,970
OK, there they are.

1414
01:11:20,970 --> 01:11:24,660
OK, this is it.

1415
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:28,470
It was Firefox, which I never
use, but it came to the rescue

1416
01:11:28,470 --> 01:11:29,220
for this one.

1417
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:31,200
So look at this,
just really quickly,

1418
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:32,330
because if you want
to play with this,

1419
01:11:32,330 --> 01:11:33,955
this will just take
one minute to show.

1420
01:11:33,955 --> 01:11:37,890
OK, there, I did
the carbon dimer.

1421
01:11:37,890 --> 01:11:40,890
That's a lot of electrons,
and it just solved it.

1422
01:11:40,890 --> 01:11:43,650
Because of what you're
going to learn on Tuesday,

1423
01:11:43,650 --> 01:11:45,780
the approximations,
it just solved it.

1424
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:49,470
And look-- if you right
click on top of the image,

1425
01:11:49,470 --> 01:11:51,690
you get surfaces, and
then you get orbitals.

1426
01:11:51,690 --> 01:11:53,040
And look at that--

1427
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:56,976
that is actually-- what do
you think those two are?

1428
01:11:56,976 --> 01:12:00,150
There are two
carbon atoms here--

1429
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:01,230
the s's.

1430
01:12:01,230 --> 01:12:05,040
Those are those 1s's
together in the dimer.

1431
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:09,300
And these are now the 2s and
p's, all bonding together.

1432
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:11,100
And you want to
know how they look?

1433
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:16,350
Well, here's one of those s's.

1434
01:12:16,350 --> 01:12:17,500
There it is.

1435
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,750
It's an S orbital in
the dimer, though.

1436
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:22,930
And it looks very much
like the atomic s orbital,

1437
01:12:22,930 --> 01:12:24,020
which it should.

1438
01:12:24,020 --> 01:12:24,520
Why?

1439
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:31,490
Remember, those are the
ones we don't care about.

1440
01:12:31,490 --> 01:12:34,370
They don't really do
anything when you bond.

1441
01:12:34,370 --> 01:12:39,130
It's all about the other
ones, like for example,

1442
01:12:39,130 --> 01:12:42,120
one of these p's.

1443
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:43,260
That's it.

1444
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:45,000
That's the solution
to the Schrodinger

1445
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,620
equation for the carbon dimer.

1446
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:50,160
And that's where
that p-type orbital--

1447
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:53,070
that's where the electron
in that level sits.

1448
01:12:53,070 --> 01:12:54,330
And this is no longer an atom.

1449
01:12:54,330 --> 01:12:55,830
You can do it for
the carbon atom,

1450
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:58,320
and see the p orbitals
and the s orbitals,

1451
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,780
but now when you
make a molecule,

1452
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:04,830
things get more complicated,
and more and more complicated.

1453
01:13:04,830 --> 01:13:07,440
So that'll be the tool we
use for our molecule things,

1454
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:10,000
assuming it actually works.

1455
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,370
And if anyone has any
questions, email me.

1456
01:13:14,370 --> 01:13:18,830
And remember, class next
Tuesday, but not next Thursday.
