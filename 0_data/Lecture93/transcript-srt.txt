1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,179
 a growing community of people on topics

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:03,179
 

3
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,859
 like fairness transparency

4
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:04,859
 

5
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:06,720
 accountability and the like and machine

6
00:00:04,849 --> 00:00:06,720
 

7
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:08,730
 learning that's really really exciting

8
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,730
 

9
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,150
 for many of us but we're gonna hear

10
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,150
 

11
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,889
 today about common pitfalls for studying

12
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,889
 

13
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,410
 the human side of machine learning and

14
00:00:13,879 --> 00:00:16,410
 

15
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:18,449
 we're excited to hear what what our

16
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,449
 

17
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,369
 speakers are going to talk about we have

18
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:20,369
 

19
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:23,070
 three people who contributed towards

20
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:23,070
 

21
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:24,810
 this tutorial Deirdre Mulligan professor

22
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,810
 

23
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,880
 at Berkeley unfortunately is not able to

24
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,880
 

25
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:31,109
 be here for reasons which are in fact

26
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:31,109
 

27
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,989
 directly linked to putting out fires but

28
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:33,989
 

29
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:36,510
 we're delighted that we have Josh Crowe

30
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:36,510
 

31
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:39,840
 a friend a leading member of the fat ml

32
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,840
 

33
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,829
 community postdoc scholar at Berkeley he

34
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:40,829
 

35
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,739
 studies the relationship between

36
00:00:40,819 --> 00:00:43,739
 

37
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:46,250
 technology and government and Nitin

38
00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:46,250
 

39
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:48,420
 Kohli who is a PhD student at Berkeley

40
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,420
 

41
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:51,930
 researching topics across privacy

42
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,930
 

43
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,910
 security and fairness a format is going

44
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,910
 

45
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,620
 to be similar to other tutorials so our

46
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,620
 

47
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,629
 speakers will speak for about half the

48
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,629
 

49
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,730
 time so up until around twelve o'clock

50
00:00:57,619 --> 00:00:59,730
 

51
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:01,829
 there abouts then we'll take a break for

52
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,829
 

53
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,439
 10-15 minutes and then we'll have the

54
00:01:01,819 --> 00:01:04,439
 

55
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:06,510
 second part of the tutorial overall

56
00:01:04,429 --> 00:01:06,510
 

57
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:08,159
 we're hoping to keep questions towards

58
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,159
 

59
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,750
 the end but if you do have any pressing

60
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:09,750
 

61
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,060
 questions then our speakers are happy to

62
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,060
 

63
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:15,160
 answer them during their talks please

64
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,160
 

65
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:22,660
 join me in welcoming our two speakers

66
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:22,660
 

67
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:25,930
[Applause]

68
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,930
 

69
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:29,020
 Thank You Adrian and welcome everyone to

70
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,020
 

71
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:30,760
 our tutorial on pitfalls in studying the

72
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,760
 

73
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:34,120
 relationship between machine learning in

74
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,120
 

75
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:37,720
 humans I'm Joshua Crowell I'm a computer

76
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,720
 

77
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:39,850
 scientist by training and I want to kick

78
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,850
 

79
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,730
 off the discussion today by talking

80
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,730
 

81
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:45,130
 about a tutorial that happened at this

82
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,130
 

83
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:47,470
 conference last year that was given by

84
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,470
 

85
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:49,000
 Solon brokest and more it's heart in

86
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,000
 

87
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:51,880
 which they noted that there's been an

88
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,880
 

89
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,420
 absolute explosion an exponential growth

90
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,420
 

91
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:58,750
 true exponential growth in the study of

92
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:58,750
 

93
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:00,610
 machine learning fairness and a question

94
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,610
 

95
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:02,110
 that I have working in an

96
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,110
 

97
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,640
 interdisciplinary context is I do

98
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,640
 

99
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:06,190
 working with a lot of social scientists

100
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,190
 

101
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:09,640
 and lawyers is to what end

102
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,640
 

103
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:10,960
 are we pursuing this research so we

104
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,960
 

105
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,940
 think it's a good idea to pursue

106
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,940
 

107
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,460
 research on machine learning fairness

108
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,460
 

109
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:17,710
 but we're not really sure where to go

110
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,710
 

111
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:22,030
 from there and so I want to take you

112
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,030
 

113
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:23,950
 with me on the sort of culmination of

114
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,950
 

115
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,860
 about a year and a half long Odyssey

116
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,860
 

117
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:32,550
 that Nitin and I have been on to

118
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:32,550
 

119
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:34,390
 consider the ways in which different

120
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,390
 

121
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,980
 communities different scholarly

122
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,980
 

123
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:39,250
 communities and different communities of

124
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,250
 

125
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:41,680
 practice think about the kinds of

126
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,680
 

127
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:45,540
 concepts that we talk about when we talk

128
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,540
 

129
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:48,070
 about human centered machine learning I

130
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,070
 

131
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:50,739
 can't tell if it's this echoey because

132
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,739
 

133
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:54,790
 the room is this equity or because the

134
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:54,790
 

135
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:59,290
 podium mic is also on it's just the room

136
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,290
 

137
00:02:54,790 --> 00:03:03,340
 okay so I want to mention that when we

138
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,340
 

139
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:05,380
 talk about machine learning fairness or

140
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,380
 

141
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,540
 accountability or transparency or

142
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,540
 

143
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,370
 interpretability and explanation these

144
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,370
 

145
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,920
 are rich concepts they have long

146
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,920
 

147
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:17,190
 histories of study in many disciplines

148
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:17,190
 

149
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:19,170
 and those are concepts which

150
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,170
 

151
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:20,550
 when we study them in a machine learning

152
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,550
 

153
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:23,040
 context we should be aware of that

154
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,040
 

155
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:25,650
 history we should connect our work to

156
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,650
 

157
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:29,130
 that history and we should understand

158
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,130
 

159
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:31,890
 what results people have come up with in

160
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,890
 

161
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:35,240
 those other areas that might help us do

162
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,240
 

163
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:37,830
 our jobs better unfortunately when we

164
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,830
 

165
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:41,330
 work in an environment like this where

166
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,330
 

167
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:44,940
 people from different backgrounds all

168
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,940
 

169
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:46,740
 communicate we run into problems that

170
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,740
 

171
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:49,110
 are purely logistical like vocabulary

172
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:49,110
 

173
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:53,010
 problems the terms that we talk about

174
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:53,010
 

175
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:55,650
 get reused to mean different things the

176
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,650
 

177
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:57,750
 same words and that causes a lot of

178
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,750
 

179
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:02,150
 unnecessary misunderstanding and

180
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:02,150
 

181
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:04,680
 argument between people who are

182
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,680
 

183
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:06,900
 considering the problems at hand

184
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,900
 

185
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,030
 here and so in this talk we're going to

186
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,030
 

187
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:12,540
 examine the different ways that some of

188
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,540
 

189
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:14,880
 these words are reused and how that

190
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,880
 

191
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,470
 leads to confusion and then we'll do

192
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,470
 

193
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,900
 some concrete case studies where we

194
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,900
 

195
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:21,750
 apply those learnings to actual machine

196
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:21,750
 

197
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:24,570
 learning problems that have come up in

198
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,570
 

199
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:33,630
 real-world contexts I'm going to hand it

200
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:33,630
 

201
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:35,550
 off to Nitin now to keep going these

202
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,550
 

203
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:38,070
 common pitfalls I want to first start by

204
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,070
 

205
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,480
 just explaining that today's talk is

206
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,480
 

207
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,560
 going to be separate from ethics and

208
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,560
 

209
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,680
 it's kind of important to make that

210
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,680
 

211
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,720
 delineation upfront so that's not to say

212
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,720
 

213
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,150
 that ethics isn't important because it

214
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,150
 

215
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,710
 most definitely is it's just that people

216
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,710
 

217
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,419
 at this point in time we're raising a

218
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,419
 

219
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:53,669
 lot of ethical objections of machine

220
00:04:51,409 --> 00:04:53,669
 

221
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:56,940
 learning in different contexts and there

222
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:56,940
 

223
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:58,440
 is a lot of value to this but one thing

224
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,440
 

225
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,880
 we want to note is that because of this

226
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,880
 

227
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,220
 folks are using ethics as like a

228
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,220
 

229
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,230
 grab-bag rhetorical solution concept and

230
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,230
 

231
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,510
 because of this grab-bag rhetorical

232
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,510
 

233
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:07,770
 solution concept idea it kind of gives

234
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,770
 

235
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:10,200
 us notion that there is an agreement

236
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,200
 

237
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:11,820
 over what ethics kind of is but that's

238
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,820
 

239
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,380
 not the case at all we know this from

240
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,380
 

241
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,390
 before from human rights civil rights

242
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,390
 

243
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:17,400
 civil liberties these are things that we

244
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,400
 

245
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:18,720
 already have made commitments about so

246
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,720
 

247
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,980
 when we focus about these common

248
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:19,980
 

249
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,830
 pitfalls we want to kind of examine

250
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,830
 

251
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:25,229
 these separately and let's try to make

252
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,229
 

253
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:27,000
 this more specific because machine

254
00:05:25,219 --> 00:05:27,000
 

255
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:29,350
 learning is fundamentally a tool that's

256
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,350
 

257
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,300
 used to solve very specific problems

258
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,300
 

259
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:32,650
 and because of that if we want the

260
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,650
 

261
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,140
 future to look different than the past

262
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,140
 

263
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,660
 we kind of have to realize that we can't

264
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,660
 

265
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,770
 blame the use machine learning for that

266
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,770
 

267
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:40,030
 notice I said blindly use machine

268
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,030
 

269
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,130
 learning right because machine learning

270
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,130
 

271
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:43,870
 is a fantastic diagnostic tool but if

272
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,870
 

273
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:45,820
 you want to use it in social context as

274
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,820
 

275
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,200
 where there is historical prejudices you

276
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,200
 

277
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:52,300
 don't want the future to look like the

278
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:52,300
 

279
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:54,340
 past anymore as such this kind of lets

280
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,340
 

281
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,600
 us know that when we use this tool for

282
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:55,600
 

283
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:58,270
 things that it wasn't designed for it

284
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:58,270
 

285
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,130
 can do very dangerous things and lastly

286
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,130
 

287
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:02,230
 just why this is an ethics as well as

288
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,230
 

289
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:04,060
 discussions of ethics tend to put the

290
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,060
 

291
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:06,430
 individual of the focus on individuals

292
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,430
 

293
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:08,200
 but when it places the burden on the

294
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,200
 

295
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,840
 individual it skirts around the issue

296
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,840
 

297
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,010
 that there are social political

298
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,010
 

299
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,950
 organizational incentive and dynamics

300
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,950
 

301
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:16,120
 involved as well so by doing this it

302
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,120
 

303
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,920
 actually ignores the broader

304
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,920
 

305
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,050
 infrastructure and environment around us

306
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,050
 

307
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,430
 so like I said we're not saying that

308
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,430
 

309
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:23,200
 where you don't care about ethics we're

310
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,200
 

311
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:30,730
 just going to hold that ass off aside to

312
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:30,730
 

313
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:35,710
 examine these common pitfalls here so in

314
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,710
 

315
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:39,540
 as in that vein we often as computer

316
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,540
 

317
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:41,530
 scientists seek precise definitions of

318
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,530
 

319
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:44,680
 what we're talking about we try to

320
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,680
 

321
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:46,240
 mathematize the problem and build a

322
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,240
 

323
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,800
 specification of the problem so that we

324
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,800
 

325
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,090
 can implement it and that's important we

326
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,090
 

327
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,390
 have to implement something at the end

328
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,390
 

329
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:55,450
 of the day but how would we know that

330
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,450
 

331
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:57,610
 such a mathematize ation such a

332
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,610
 

333
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:59,170
 specification is is correct what would

334
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,170
 

335
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:02,770
 it mean for for such a thing to be

336
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,770
 

337
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:07,810
 correct I put to you that these

338
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:07,810
 

339
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:10,330
 definitions of complex human values are

340
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,330
 

341
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:12,040
 unhelpful but you actually still need to

342
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,040
 

343
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:14,970
 do them you need to do them both because

344
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,970
 

345
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:18,520
 you still have to implement and because

346
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,520
 

347
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:20,050
 by specifying what you mean either by

348
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,050
 

349
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:23,470
 some concept that you're trying to

350
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,470
 

351
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:24,820
 capture in a tool in a product just in a

352
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,820
 

353
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:29,830
 word that you're using and you're

354
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:29,830
 

355
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:32,380
 writing you have specified enough that

356
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,380
 

357
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:34,810
 you and other people can figure out what

358
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,810
 

359
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:36,310
 the limitations of what you're doing are

360
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,310
 

361
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:37,370
 and there are a couple of reasons

362
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,370
 

363
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:41,030
 that

364
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,030
 

365
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:43,550
 the definitions even once you've put

366
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,550
 

367
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:47,810
 them down still aren't solving your

368
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:47,810
 

369
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:49,580
 problem one idea or one key reason for

370
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,580
 

371
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:52,190
 that is that human values are

372
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,190
 

373
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:54,440
 complicated they're rich they resist

374
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,440
 

375
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:55,910
 definition and there is this definition

376
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,910
 

377
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:59,830
 in a really interesting way there's a

378
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,830
 

379
00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:02,660
 concept from the social sciences of

380
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,660
 

381
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:05,240
 what's referred to as essentially

382
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,240
 

383
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:10,250
 contested concepts these are ideas where

384
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:10,250
 

385
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:12,860
 we agree on the notion that there is a

386
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,860
 

387
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:14,720
 concept out there for us to find that

388
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,720
 

389
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:17,360
 fairness is out there we should go and

390
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:17,360
 

391
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,490
 get it but we don't maybe all agree on

392
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,490
 

393
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:25,600
 how to instantiate that concept in the

394
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:25,600
 

395
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:27,980
 world so that means that when we try to

396
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,980
 

397
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,390
 look at a concrete instantiation we're

398
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,390
 

399
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:31,160
 going to disagree about it that

400
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,160
 

401
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:34,520
 disagreement is inherent

402
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:34,520
 

403
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:37,280
 similarly definitions don't hold for

404
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:37,280
 

405
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:39,050
 everyone so what's say fair for you

406
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:39,050
 

407
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,540
 might not be fair for me

408
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,540
 

409
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:44,480
 and that might be true even if we agree

410
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:44,480
 

411
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:49,520
 abstractly on what fairness should mean

412
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:49,520
 

413
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:51,770
 in a particular context so you have this

414
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,770
 

415
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,440
 problem in lots of concrete cases a

416
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,440
 

417
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:58,960
 really well studied one is recidivism

418
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:58,960
 

419
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:01,490
 risk rating which is the problem of if

420
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,490
 

421
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:06,260
 someone is arrested we give them a score

422
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,260
 

423
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:08,150
 and that score tells us whether we think

424
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,150
 

425
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,740
 they are or what we think the risk is

426
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,740
 

427
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:11,420
 that they will be arrested again in a

428
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,420
 

429
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:17,000
 certain amount of time now if we

430
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:17,000
 

431
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:20,480
 calibrate that risk to the the actual

432
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:20,480
 

433
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,210
 level of risk that people encounter what

434
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:23,210
 

435
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,370
 we find is that we give a higher level

436
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,370
 

437
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:27,140
 of risk to people of color and

438
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,140
 

439
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:29,210
 minorities in most jurisdictions because

440
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,210
 

441
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:32,660
 those people actually do have a higher

442
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,660
 

443
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:34,550
 risk of arrest absent anything else

444
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,550
 

445
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:37,160
 including by the way whether that person

446
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,160
 

447
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:39,220
 has in fact committed a crime or or done

448
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:39,220
 

449
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:42,710
 anything that should be arrest of all

450
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:42,710
 

451
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:45,710
 and so that offends our sense of

452
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,710
 

453
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:47,450
 fairness there's a famous article or

454
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,450
 

455
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:49,769
 series of articles in the media about

456
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,769
 

457
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:52,470
 how this offends our sense of fairness

458
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:52,470
 

459
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:56,189
 it means that people of color get scores

460
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:56,189
 

461
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:58,470
 that are erroneously high more often

462
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:58,470
 

463
00:09:56,189 --> 00:10:02,670
 than white people

464
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:02,670
 

465
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:04,170
 and that seems like a bug in the system

466
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,170
 

467
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:06,449
 it seems like something we shouldn't

468
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,449
 

469
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:08,819
 have it seems like it's unfair and yet

470
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,819
 

471
00:10:06,449 --> 00:10:11,429
 if we tried to solve this problem by

472
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:11,429
 

473
00:10:08,819 --> 00:10:13,410
 breaking the calibration we would end up

474
00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:13,410
 

475
00:10:11,429 --> 00:10:14,819
 in a scenario where the scores mean

476
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,819
 

477
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:17,730
 different things for different people

478
00:10:14,809 --> 00:10:17,730
 

479
00:10:14,819 --> 00:10:20,579
 and that also offends a different

480
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,579
 

481
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:23,040
 intuitive sense of fairness that we have

482
00:10:20,569 --> 00:10:23,040
 

483
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:25,679
 and that leads us to the conclusion that

484
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,679
 

485
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,709
 if we want to capture human values in a

486
00:10:25,669 --> 00:10:28,709
 

487
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:30,749
 system it's not enough to look to

488
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:30,749
 

489
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:32,369
 mathematical correctness we often think

490
00:10:30,739 --> 00:10:32,369
 

491
00:10:30,749 --> 00:10:35,309
 as computer scientists and machine

492
00:10:32,359 --> 00:10:35,309
 

493
00:10:32,369 --> 00:10:37,259
 learning researchers that if the models

494
00:10:35,299 --> 00:10:37,259
 

495
00:10:35,309 --> 00:10:39,029
 we build represent the data that we have

496
00:10:37,249 --> 00:10:39,029
 

497
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:41,730
 and the data that we have represent the

498
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:41,730
 

499
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:43,410
 world then we're done we've done our job

500
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,410
 

501
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:46,379
 we've done the technical part of the job

502
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,379
 

503
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:47,910
 and these messy social problems these

504
00:10:46,369 --> 00:10:47,910
 

505
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:50,549
 human values problems they belong to

506
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,549
 

507
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:54,299
 someone else they they can be outsourced

508
00:10:50,539 --> 00:10:54,299
 

509
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:57,649
 to the lawyers to the policy people to

510
00:10:54,289 --> 00:10:57,649
 

511
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:59,519
 the product managers to the customers

512
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:59,519
 

513
00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:03,379
 but they you know they're not our

514
00:10:59,509 --> 00:11:03,379
 

515
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:06,449
 problems as as machine learning people

516
00:11:03,369 --> 00:11:06,449
 

517
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:09,240
 but I put to you that that is that is

518
00:11:06,439 --> 00:11:09,240
 

519
00:11:06,449 --> 00:11:11,249
 incorrect these are not technical

520
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,249
 

521
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,809
 problems they're socio technical

522
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:12,809
 

523
00:11:11,249 --> 00:11:16,970
 problems problems in which we have

524
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:16,970
 

525
00:11:12,809 --> 00:11:22,619
 coupled together people and machines and

526
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:22,619
 

527
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:24,240
 models and the whole of our society and

528
00:11:22,609 --> 00:11:24,240
 

529
00:11:22,619 --> 00:11:26,699
 the technologies don't live in a vacuum

530
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,699
 

531
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,549
 and if we pretend that they do we've

532
00:11:26,689 --> 00:11:29,549
 

533
00:11:26,699 --> 00:11:32,040
 kind of put our blinders on and decided

534
00:11:29,539 --> 00:11:32,040
 

535
00:11:29,549 --> 00:11:34,369
 that we're just going to ignore any any

536
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,369
 

537
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:37,110
 human values problems and if we say that

538
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:37,110
 

539
00:11:34,369 --> 00:11:38,999
 something is not my problem then we've

540
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,999
 

541
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:41,069
 kind of disclaimed the responsibility

542
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:41,069
 

543
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:42,929
 that comes with what we want which is

544
00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:42,929
 

545
00:11:41,069 --> 00:11:44,790
 the ability to use these technologies to

546
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,790
 

547
00:11:42,929 --> 00:11:50,160
 do good in the world

548
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:50,160
 

549
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:51,989
 and to how to allow technology to take

550
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,989
 

551
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,139
 an important place and to really affect

552
00:11:51,979 --> 00:11:55,139
 

553
00:11:51,989 --> 00:11:57,769
 people's lives I'll hand it back off to

554
00:11:55,129 --> 00:11:57,769
 

555
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:57,769
 Nitin now

556
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:58,700
 

557
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:02,980
 great so now that we know we're

558
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,980
 

559
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,080
 considering associate technical problems

560
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:05,080
 

561
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:07,150
 let's look at how current approaches to

562
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:07,150
 

563
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,010
 fairness are discussed in the literature

564
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,010
 

565
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:10,270
 a bit not only looking at the CS point

566
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,270
 

567
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:12,130
 of view but also looking from legal

568
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,130
 

569
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:13,840
 scholars from sociologists and other

570
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,840
 

571
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,860
 folks as well to kind of get a lay of

572
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:14,860
 

573
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,130
 the land and how these different

574
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:17,130
 

575
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:19,390
 communities are attacking this problem

576
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,390
 

577
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:20,860
 but before I get there I kind of want to

578
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,860
 

579
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:22,630
 just make a note that last year at Kate

580
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,630
 

581
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:24,490
 Crawford I gave a keynote at this very

582
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,490
 

583
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:27,010
 conference in which he gave a taxonomy

584
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,010
 

585
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:28,750
 of harms I can occur she noted that

586
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,750
 

587
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:31,180
 there were allocated harms I can occur

588
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,180
 

589
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:32,500
 from unfairness there representational

590
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:32,500
 

591
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,510
 harms like occur from unfairness

592
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,510
 

593
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,580
 so these allocate of harms are the ones

594
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,580
 

595
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:38,800
 where like an individual or a group of

596
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,800
 

597
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:40,870
 individuals have an opportunity or some

598
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,870
 

599
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,730
 object that is withheld from them

600
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,730
 

601
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:44,650
 whereas representational harms are ones

602
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,650
 

603
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:47,950
 in which groups or individuals are

604
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,950
 

605
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:50,170
 subject to inordinate subordination due

606
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,170
 

607
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:51,760
 to certain things but there's also even

608
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,760
 

609
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:53,590
 a third type that we can think of as

610
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,590
 

611
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,390
 dignitary harms I come from fairness as

612
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,390
 

613
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:58,330
 well and for lack of imagination

614
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,330
 

615
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:59,700
 dignitary harms are just well a loss of

616
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,700
 

617
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:03,190
 dignity

618
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:03,190
 

619
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:05,470
 so let's actually start off with what is

620
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,470
 

621
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:07,060
 fairness from thinking not as computer

622
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,060
 

623
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:08,830
 scientists or statisticians like I am

624
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,830
 

625
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:10,420
 but just actually thinking about it how

626
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,420
 

627
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:13,510
 it works in the world so like in law for

628
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:13,510
 

629
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:15,460
 example if we think about fairness as a

630
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,460
 

631
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:16,600
 process in the law we have notions of

632
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,600
 

633
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,250
 due process of law

634
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,250
 

635
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,910
 these are things that usually require

636
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,910
 

637
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:24,340
 notice hearing usually some type of

638
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,340
 

639
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:26,470
 trial or commitment by an impartial

640
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,470
 

641
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,850
 adjudicator the notion of the fairness

642
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,850
 

643
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:29,830
 that occurs in these is because of the

644
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,830
 

645
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:32,110
 process itself not the outcome that

646
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,110
 

647
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:33,580
 occurs afterwards it's this nice idea

648
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,580
 

649
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:35,680
 that hey we have the ability to

650
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,680
 

651
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:37,510
 represent ourselves and we also have the

652
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,510
 

653
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,960
 ability to contest outputs at every set

654
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,960
 

655
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:42,510
 of the way in terms of this adversarial

656
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:42,510
 

657
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:44,950
 setting that set up with the judges

658
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,950
 

659
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:46,810
 another case in which fairness can be

660
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,810
 

661
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:48,280
 thought of as a process is actually in

662
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,280
 

663
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,810
 voting in some way

664
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,810
 

665
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:52,930
 and this might seem a little funny but

666
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,930
 

667
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:54,910
 when we take part in a boating scheme we

668
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,910
 

669
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:56,140
 have an interest that were related than

670
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,140
 

671
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,610
 the sheep to the voting machine

672
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,610
 

673
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:59,950
 so usually voting right at the most

674
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,950
 

675
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:01,450
 abstract level I have a preference for

676
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,450
 

677
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:03,700
 candidates and I want to submit that

678
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,700
 

679
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:05,470
 preference to a voting scheme that can

680
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,470
 

681
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:08,470
 somehow compute a societal preference

682
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,470
 

683
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:10,870
 and then output an answer to who won the

684
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,870
 

685
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:11,139
 election now we might say that even

686
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,139
 

687
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,939
 though

688
00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:12,939
 

689
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:15,369
 outcome of the vote if the election

690
00:14:12,929 --> 00:14:15,369
 

691
00:14:12,939 --> 00:14:17,019
 wasn't what I wanted to vote for we know

692
00:14:15,359 --> 00:14:17,019
 

693
00:14:15,369 --> 00:14:19,149
 that there's a notion of this procedural

694
00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:19,149
 

695
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:20,529
 notion of fairness simply because of the

696
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:20,529
 

697
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:22,959
 fact I was allowed to take part in the

698
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:22,959
 

699
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:24,999
 process I was involved along the way I'm

700
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:24,999
 

701
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,769
 much like in due process I'm involved in

702
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,769
 

703
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:30,730
 the impartial adjudication along the way

704
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:30,730
 

705
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:33,879
 a third case actually comes from gdpr

706
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,879
 

707
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:34,959
 from our favorite article 22 for those

708
00:14:33,869 --> 00:14:34,959
 

709
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:37,779
 of us who are keeping up with all the

710
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:37,779
 

711
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,970
 articles but this tells us that humans

712
00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:39,970
 

713
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:42,160
 should be able to evaluate humans and

714
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,160
 

715
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:45,009
 this actually gets at the notion of

716
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:45,009
 

717
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:47,259
 dignitary harms so even if a model can

718
00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:47,259
 

719
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:48,790
 do better on a task than a human it's

720
00:14:47,249 --> 00:14:48,790
 

721
00:14:47,259 --> 00:14:50,679
 the idea that the decision needs to be

722
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,679
 

723
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:53,169
 made by a human because evaluations of

724
00:14:50,669 --> 00:14:53,169
 

725
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:55,419
 this can lead to loss of dignity so

726
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:55,419
 

727
00:14:53,169 --> 00:14:56,889
 outside of the technical literature we

728
00:14:55,409 --> 00:14:56,889
 

729
00:14:55,419 --> 00:14:58,439
 notice that fairness as part of a

730
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:58,439
 

731
00:14:56,889 --> 00:15:00,999
 process actually

732
00:14:58,429 --> 00:15:00,999
 

733
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:02,499
 but as technical folks like I'm a

734
00:15:00,989 --> 00:15:02,499
 

735
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:04,029
 statistician josh is a computer

736
00:15:02,489 --> 00:15:04,029
 

737
00:15:02,499 --> 00:15:06,189
 scientist if we want to do math we need

738
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:06,189
 

739
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:07,689
 mathematical objects which means we need

740
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:07,689
 

741
00:15:06,189 --> 00:15:10,989
 to define fairness in some mathematize

742
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:10,989
 

743
00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:12,819
 way and when we get to that it turns out

744
00:15:10,979 --> 00:15:12,819
 

745
00:15:10,989 --> 00:15:14,559
 that our definitions of fairness tend to

746
00:15:12,809 --> 00:15:14,559
 

747
00:15:12,819 --> 00:15:16,839
 be more outcome based as opposed to more

748
00:15:14,549 --> 00:15:16,839
 

749
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:19,029
 process based so this might be things

750
00:15:16,829 --> 00:15:19,029
 

751
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:20,949
 like saying the false positive rate

752
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:20,949
 

753
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:22,449
 amongst sensitive groups is equalized

754
00:15:20,939 --> 00:15:22,449
 

755
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:26,649
 things that are very easy for us to

756
00:15:22,439 --> 00:15:26,649
 

757
00:15:22,449 --> 00:15:28,299
 measure and argue with but when we

758
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,299
 

759
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:32,470
 actually make these fairness definitions

760
00:15:28,289 --> 00:15:32,470
 

761
00:15:28,299 --> 00:15:33,790
 something funny happens so in terms of

762
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,790
 

763
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:35,019
 like what fairness is when we come up

764
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,019
 

765
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:36,910
 with a fairness definition it's more

766
00:15:35,009 --> 00:15:36,910
 

767
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:38,889
 like an invariant of unfairness we want

768
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,889
 

769
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:41,579
 to protect against as opposed to saying

770
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:41,579
 

771
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:43,629
 the system is fair if this occurs and

772
00:15:41,569 --> 00:15:43,629
 

773
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:45,369
 because of that it leads us down this

774
00:15:43,619 --> 00:15:45,369
 

775
00:15:43,629 --> 00:15:46,809
 funny path that we as computer

776
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:46,809
 

777
00:15:45,369 --> 00:15:49,509
 scientists and statisticians argue about

778
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:49,509
 

779
00:15:46,809 --> 00:15:55,449
 outcomes but legal scholars sociologists

780
00:15:49,499 --> 00:15:55,449
 

781
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:58,569
 philosophers talk about process yeah

782
00:15:55,439 --> 00:15:58,569
 

783
00:15:55,449 --> 00:15:59,860
 that's the second thing I want to talk

784
00:15:58,559 --> 00:15:59,860
 

785
00:15:58,569 --> 00:16:02,169
 about is not only are there difference

786
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:02,169
 

787
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:04,480
 between process and outcomes but that

788
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:04,480
 

789
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:06,009
 trade-offs are inevitable and they're

790
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,009
 

791
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,049
 inevitable in a couple ways so let's

792
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:08,049
 

793
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:10,959
 first think as you know more mathy folks

794
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:10,959
 

795
00:16:08,049 --> 00:16:12,759
 why they're inevitable a mathematical

796
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:12,759
 

797
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,410
 fairness definition essentially places a

798
00:16:12,749 --> 00:16:14,410
 

799
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:17,649
 constraint on the behavior of a system

800
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,649
 

801
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:19,119
 and this constraint is going to narrow

802
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:19,119
 

803
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:22,119
 down the class of models that could

804
00:16:19,109 --> 00:16:22,119
 

805
00:16:19,119 --> 00:16:23,310
 satisfy these conditions so if we decide

806
00:16:22,109 --> 00:16:23,310
 

807
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:26,190
 to add in too many

808
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,190
 

809
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:27,779
 as constraints to a system some of these

810
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,779
 

811
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:29,130
 might be self contradictory and ceased

812
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:29,130
 

813
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,990
 the model to exist anymore

814
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,990
 

815
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:32,460
 leading the impossibilities of fairness

816
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,460
 

817
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:35,279
 in which there's been so many papers

818
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,279
 

819
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:37,350
 written about but even more so

820
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:37,350
 

821
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,330
 trade-offs are inevitable in more of a

822
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,330
 

823
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:41,760
 value judgment way in that when I choose

824
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,760
 

825
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:44,400
 what fairness definition to apply in a

826
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,400
 

827
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:46,290
 scenario I'm making a trade-off with my

828
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,290
 

829
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,420
 own judgment into what is important in

830
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,420
 

831
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:49,410
 this case or not

832
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:49,410
 

833
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:52,800
 fairness looks different to different

834
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,800
 

835
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:54,570
 people and what's kind of interesting is

836
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,570
 

837
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,310
 from the computational standpoint like

838
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,310
 

839
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:58,890
 I'm guilty of this as well at times is

840
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,890
 

841
00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:02,100
 like we like to put things in a loss

842
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,100
 

843
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:04,260
 function and let it run right but Arvind

844
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,260
 

845
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,720
 Ryan at fat star in 2018 had this great

846
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,720
 

847
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:08,640
 quote in which he said the usual like CS

848
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,640
 

849
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,370
 and SATs approach is to throw everything

850
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:11,370
 

851
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,050
 into a loss function and optimize it to

852
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,050
 

853
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:14,490
 hope that fairness occurs afterwards but

854
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,490
 

855
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:16,410
 that's kind of like counting apples and

856
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,410
 

857
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:18,180
 fairness and concluding that the total

858
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,180
 

859
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,920
 is 7 but that doesn't make any sense

860
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,920
 

861
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,600
 that when we actually toss things into a

862
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,600
 

863
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,339
 loss function we're outsourcing the

864
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,339
 

865
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,199
 responsibility and the trade-off as well

866
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:25,199
 

867
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:30,960
 of the value judgment we made for the

868
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:30,960
 

869
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:32,790
 fairness definition we chose and as Josh

870
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,790
 

871
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,890
 mentioned fairness is this you know

872
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,890
 

873
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:35,220
 essentially contested concept we can all

874
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,220
 

875
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:37,050
 agree

876
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:37,050
 

877
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:40,470
 hopefully here that we want things to be

878
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,470
 

879
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:42,750
 fair but we can't quite agree on how to

880
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,750
 

881
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:44,490
 articulate it and that leads to this

882
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,490
 

883
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,020
 kind of uncomfortable notion which I

884
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,020
 

885
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:47,820
 guess is kind of comfortable in some way

886
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:47,820
 

887
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,200
 but it's once we have a definition it

888
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,200
 

889
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:51,690
 will look different to different people

890
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,690
 

891
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,800
 right fairness for one individual in the

892
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,800
 

893
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:57,420
 process will look different than

894
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:57,420
 

895
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:58,950
 fairness for another one and the last

896
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,950
 

897
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:01,140
 point on fairness that I want to make is

898
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,140
 

899
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:03,200
 you know maybe the problem is elsewhere

900
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:03,200
 

901
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:06,390
 so let me unpack this a little bit more

902
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:06,390
 

903
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,670
 so if we focus on fairness in machine

904
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,670
 

905
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:10,470
 learning or in our models in general we

906
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,470
 

907
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:12,630
 kind of miss out on the fact that

908
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,630
 

909
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:14,340
 fairness might be able to be attacked in

910
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,340
 

911
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:16,410
 different parts of an environment as

912
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:16,410
 

913
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:18,750
 well so let's think back to like risk

914
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,750
 

915
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:20,370
 recidivism that Josh mentioned when we

916
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,370
 

917
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,960
 have risk recidivism we're trying to

918
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,960
 

919
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:24,690
 attack this problem of creating a model

920
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:24,690
 

921
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:27,630
 that somehow manifests as fair or unfair

922
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,630
 

923
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:29,160
 by certain fairness definitions but that

924
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,160
 

925
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:30,390
 completely skirts the issue that the

926
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,390
 

927
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,130
 environment in which the data was

928
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,130
 

929
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:34,230
 collected or that the model was deployed

930
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,230
 

931
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:36,809
 in itself fundamentally on

932
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,809
 

933
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:38,250
 so trying to only solve the fairness and

934
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,250
 

935
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:39,930
 the point of the model misses out on the

936
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,930
 

937
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,610
 fact that the world exists around it and

938
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,610
 

939
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:43,559
 there are other unfairness things that

940
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,559
 

941
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:45,059
 contribute to the development of it and

942
00:18:43,549 --> 00:18:45,059
 

943
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:49,620
 also the implementation that occurs

944
00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:49,620
 

945
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:50,970
 afterwards so we can actually make this

946
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:50,970
 

947
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:53,220
 even more concrete a little bit more

948
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,220
 

949
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:55,380
 right like so let's suppose I want to

950
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:55,380
 

951
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:57,960
 build a model to decide if somebody I

952
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:57,960
 

953
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:00,210
 want to hire will be a good employee but

954
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:00,210
 

955
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,500
 let's complicate this scenario a little

956
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,500
 

957
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:03,809
 bit more and suppose that I work in a

958
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:03,809
 

959
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,430
 toxic work environment so because the

960
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:05,430
 

961
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:08,340
 work environment is toxic a lot of our

962
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,340
 

963
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:09,690
 best employees leave the firm so now

964
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,690
 

965
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:11,490
 what happens when I try to build this

966
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,490
 

967
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,410
 model of like trying to model what a

968
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,410
 

969
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:15,150
 good employee would look like I'm

970
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,150
 

971
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:16,590
 actually building the model on a subset

972
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,590
 

973
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:19,410
 of employees who just decided to stay

974
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,410
 

975
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:21,360
 and furthermore when I actually designed

976
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,360
 

977
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:22,890
 this system it ignores the fact that

978
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,890
 

979
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,660
 there were certain attributes of the

980
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,660
 

981
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:26,160
 entire environment all around us that

982
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:26,160
 

983
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:28,320
 were unfair in general that might have

984
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,320
 

985
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,590
 led to certain groups of individuals

986
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,590
 

987
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:34,410
 leaving at a different rate than others

988
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:34,410
 

989
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:37,290
 so in really it doesn't really matter

990
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,290
 

991
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:39,870
 like in some ways that you're building a

992
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,870
 

993
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:41,370
 fair system if the context in which it's

994
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,370
 

995
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:43,620
 deployed in or developed in is

996
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,620
 

997
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:45,480
 fundamentally unfair right fairness and

998
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:45,480
 

999
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:47,250
 is essentially contested concept the

1000
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:47,250
 

1001
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,140
 mathematical definition is something so

1002
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,140
 

1003
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:56,160
 narrow but there exists a world around

1004
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:56,160
 

1005
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:59,010
 it so I'm I'm gonna turn away from

1006
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:59,010
 

1007
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:02,940
 fairness now to talk about some other

1008
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,940
 

1009
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:06,059
 concepts the next concept on the docket

1010
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:06,059
 

1011
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:08,390
 today is accountability and I think of

1012
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:08,390
 

1013
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:11,760
 accountability as a concept that

1014
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:11,760
 

1015
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:13,440
 fundamentally is about invariance it's

1016
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,440
 

1017
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,140
 about what should be true of a system

1018
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:16,140
 

1019
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,210
 and then functionally where should we

1020
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:18,210
 

1021
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:21,020
 intervene on the system to guarantee

1022
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,020
 

1023
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:22,920
 that this is true and I think of that

1024
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:22,920
 

1025
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:26,220
 following a little bit of a layered

1026
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:26,220
 

1027
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:28,350
 model so at the bottom layer the sort of

1028
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:28,350
 

1029
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:32,130
 most basic approach to thinking about

1030
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:32,130
 

1031
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:35,040
 this is to literally do accounting to

1032
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,040
 

1033
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:36,000
 work toward accountability to keep

1034
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,000
 

1035
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,429
 records

1036
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:38,429
 

1037
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,860
 what is the system doing how is it doing

1038
00:20:38,419 --> 00:20:40,860
 

1039
00:20:38,429 --> 00:20:43,760
 those things what version of the system

1040
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:43,760
 

1041
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:45,440
 was deployed

1042
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,440
 

1043
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,960
 you know to make a particular decision

1044
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,960
 

1045
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:51,170
 what inputs were given to that software

1046
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:51,170
 

1047
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:53,480
 what outputs did it produce what was its

1048
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,480
 

1049
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:56,120
 environment like can we reproduce its

1050
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:56,120
 

1051
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:59,900
 behavior at the next level of

1052
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:59,900
 

1053
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:03,350
 abstraction up we might look at those

1054
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:03,350
 

1055
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:05,750
 records maybe take some analytics maybe

1056
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,750
 

1057
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:07,340
 make some decisions based on how the

1058
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,340
 

1059
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:10,490
 system is doing maybe we find some bugs

1060
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:10,490
 

1061
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:12,920
 maybe we fix those bugs maybe we decide

1062
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,920
 

1063
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:14,720
 that the some of those bugs correspond

1064
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,720
 

1065
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,820
 to errors or mistakes that people make

1066
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,820
 

1067
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:20,090
 maybe we mete out some kind of

1068
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:20,090
 

1069
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:23,090
 punishment for those for those errors so

1070
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,090
 

1071
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:26,030
 we judge the system in some way the the

1072
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,030
 

1073
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:28,070
 sort of final highest layer is that we

1074
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,070
 

1075
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:31,400
 take responsibility that someone is

1076
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:31,400
 

1077
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:33,770
 responsible for the system and its

1078
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,770
 

1079
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:37,970
 outputs and the outcomes that come out

1080
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,970
 

1081
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:40,400
 of those outputs and so that's I think

1082
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,400
 

1083
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:45,260
 the important point about accountability

1084
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:45,260
 

1085
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:48,730
 is that it it captures both kind of

1086
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,730
 

1087
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:52,100
 detailed notions of record-keeping from

1088
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,100
 

1089
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:53,680
 the technical literature from computer

1090
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:53,680
 

1091
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,910
 science people often talk about

1092
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,910
 

1093
00:21:53,680 --> 00:22:00,890
 accountable systems as systems where you

1094
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:00,890
 

1095
00:21:55,910 --> 00:22:02,900
 can point out Mis behavior through some

1096
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,900
 

1097
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:05,480
 sort of record-keeping scheme and maybe

1098
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:05,480
 

1099
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:08,510
 isolated to a component maybe isolate it

1100
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:08,510
 

1101
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:10,040
 to a particular change set but when

1102
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,040
 

1103
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:13,430
 people talk about accountability in the

1104
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:13,430
 

1105
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:15,380
 law or in political philosophy they mean

1106
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,380
 

1107
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:17,750
 something about assigning responsibility

1108
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:17,750
 

1109
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:20,450
 to humans and humans are always

1110
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,450
 

1111
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:21,980
 accountable we sometimes hear I'm even

1112
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,980
 

1113
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:24,200
 guilty of this right the title of my

1114
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:24,200
 

1115
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:26,210
 dissertation was accountable algorithms

1116
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,210
 

1117
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,070
 but algorithms are not accountable

1118
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,070
 

1119
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:30,890
 humans are accountable someone is

1120
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,890
 

1121
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:33,800
 accountable for the algorithms and

1122
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,800
 

1123
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:35,300
 that's important to remember and

1124
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,300
 

1125
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,130
 similarly it's important to remember

1126
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:37,130
 

1127
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:41,030
 that we have to think about what the

1128
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,030
 

1129
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:43,580
 unit of analysis is so we might just

1130
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,580
 

1131
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:48,320
 like Nitin was talking about fairness in

1132
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:48,320
 

1133
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:50,060
 in context we can ask both for records

1134
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,060
 

1135
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,340
 at the level of an individual component

1136
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:52,340
 

1137
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:55,540
 or we can ask for records about a whole

1138
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:55,540
 

1139
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:57,220
 system the kinds of records we

1140
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,220
 

1141
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:59,080
 are different and they're going to

1142
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,080
 

1143
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:03,490
 depend on the particular invariants we

1144
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:03,490
 

1145
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:05,470
 want to enforce there are going to

1146
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,470
 

1147
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:07,840
 depend on who the person is who is

1148
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,840
 

1149
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:10,780
 ultimately responsible and what that

1150
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:10,780
 

1151
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:15,760
 person is responsible for and what is

1152
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:15,760
 

1153
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:17,170
 going to be decided about in terms of if

1154
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,170
 

1155
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,690
 the system goes wrong as someone

1156
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,690
 

1157
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:21,730
 punished a are we trying to remedy the

1158
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,730
 

1159
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:24,600
 the incorrect decision somehow that all

1160
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,600
 

1161
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:33,550
 plays into how we consider

1162
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:33,550
 

1163
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:36,490
 accountability so following up on this

1164
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,490
 

1165
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:38,620
 idea that accountability was touching on

1166
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,620
 

1167
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:41,080
 like you know the when and where right

1168
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:41,080
 

1169
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:42,730
 it operated at different scales we also

1170
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,730
 

1171
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,380
 find that transparency and explain

1172
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,380
 

1173
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:46,390
 ability themselves are our noble goals

1174
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:46,390
 

1175
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:47,710
 but they're incomplete solutions and

1176
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,710
 

1177
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:49,750
 that they're missing operative words

1178
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,750
 

1179
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:51,820
 just how Josh kind of went through the

1180
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,820
 

1181
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:53,440
 win and where of accountability the who

1182
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:53,440
 

1183
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:55,840
 what when where why how is our important

1184
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,840
 

1185
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,550
 is specifying what these terms do so as

1186
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,550
 

1187
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,470
 we're gonna flush out now we usually

1188
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,470
 

1189
00:23:57,550 --> 00:24:02,080
 find that calls for transparency explain

1190
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:02,080
 

1191
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:04,210
 ability are incomplete solutions in that

1192
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:04,210
 

1193
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:07,360
 they failed to specify transparent over

1194
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,360
 

1195
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:09,250
 what or like transparent to whom these

1196
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,250
 

1197
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,080
 user notions are actually very important

1198
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,080
 

1199
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:12,790
 and actually making meaningful and I

1200
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,790
 

1201
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:16,140
 guess sufficient notions of transparency

1202
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:16,140
 

1203
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:19,120
 and explain ability for humans

1204
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:19,120
 

1205
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:22,060
 so in particular transparency is often

1206
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:22,060
 

1207
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,950
 offered as a solution concept in a legal

1208
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:23,950
 

1209
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:27,130
 context lawyers will say what we need

1210
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,130
 

1211
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:30,040
 here is more transparency in the system

1212
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,040
 

1213
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:33,120
 and to computer scientists that often

1214
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:33,120
 

1215
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:35,800
 means well what we need to do is make

1216
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:35,800
 

1217
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:38,380
 the code and data available so we're

1218
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:38,380
 

1219
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:41,980
 gonna put all the code up on github

1220
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:41,980
 

1221
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:44,590
 we'll post the data somehow and I think

1222
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:44,590
 

1223
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:48,100
 this this is not good enough for a

1224
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:48,100
 

1225
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:50,170
 couple of reasons one if we just do this

1226
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:50,170
 

1227
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:52,000
 we have elided all sorts of decisions

1228
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,000
 

1229
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:55,450
 we've made along the way how did we

1230
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,450
 

1231
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,980
 clean the data how did we decide what we

1232
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,980
 

1233
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:58,420
 were gathering what they were gathering

1234
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:58,420
 

1235
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:00,220
 in the first place this is just a data

1236
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:00,220
 

1237
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:02,590
 set of convenience or is this some data

1238
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:02,590
 

1239
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:04,570
 that we actually went out to collect for

1240
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,570
 

1241
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:06,800
 a purpose and we thought carefully about

1242
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,800
 

1243
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:11,600
 how we were going to collect that data

1244
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:11,600
 

1245
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:14,450
 and also the technical disclosures are

1246
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:14,450
 

1247
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,160
 you know they help us write they we look

1248
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,160
 

1249
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:18,230
 at them we say Oh anyone can check our

1250
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:18,230
 

1251
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:21,170
 work they can go online they can see

1252
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:21,170
 

1253
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:23,030
 what we did and how and why we did those

1254
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,030
 

1255
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:27,020
 things and and engage with it in that

1256
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:27,020
 

1257
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:28,670
 sense to the person on the the ground

1258
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:28,670
 

1259
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:31,280
 level who's having a decision made about

1260
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,280
 

1261
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:34,400
 them by some sort of model those

1262
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:34,400
 

1263
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:36,440
 disclosures aren't really useful or

1264
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:36,440
 

1265
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:42,130
 understandable and so they don't help

1266
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:42,130
 

1267
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:45,710
 them gather any information about what

1268
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,710
 

1269
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:46,970
 went into the process and that notion of

1270
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,970
 

1271
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,530
 what went into the process is also

1272
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,530
 

1273
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:51,200
 important often when we talk about

1274
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,200
 

1275
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:53,210
 transparency in a governance context we

1276
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:53,210
 

1277
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,650
 mean something about participatory

1278
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,650
 

1279
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:59,990
 designs so often transparency is used in

1280
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,990
 

1281
00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:02,780
 political science or public policy to

1282
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:02,780
 

1283
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:05,240
 mean something about people being able

1284
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:05,240
 

1285
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:07,460
 to come forward and put their

1286
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,460
 

1287
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,920
 preferences into a rulemaking process

1288
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:09,920
 

1289
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:14,330
 and decide what the rule should be and

1290
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:14,330
 

1291
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:15,710
 maybe a process like the US has the law

1292
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,710
 

1293
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:17,600
 called the Administrative Procedures Act

1294
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,600
 

1295
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:19,610
 which contains a process called the

1296
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,610
 

1297
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,710
 notice of proposed rulemaking process

1298
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,710
 

1299
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:25,670
 which requires administrative agencies

1300
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:25,670
 

1301
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:27,830
 to publish their plans and to take

1302
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,830
 

1303
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:29,990
 public comments on those plans and then

1304
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,990
 

1305
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:31,940
 to respond in writing to those comments

1306
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,940
 

1307
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:33,500
 the other reason that transparency is

1308
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,500
 

1309
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:36,020
 not good enough is a purely technical

1310
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:36,020
 

1311
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:38,450
 reason which is it's not the case that

1312
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:38,450
 

1313
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:40,550
 just disclosing all the code and all the

1314
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,550
 

1315
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:43,550
 data is first of all desirable right

1316
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:43,550
 

1317
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:46,970
 maybe there's a privacy problem but also

1318
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:46,970
 

1319
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:49,130
 it doesn't even help you get at the

1320
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,130
 

1321
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:50,690
 outcome and of course you all know this

1322
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,690
 

1323
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:53,990
 already because you all know what a

1324
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,990
 

1325
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:56,120
 lottery is a lottery is a process which

1326
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,120
 

1327
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:58,490
 is perfectly transparent I tell you

1328
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:58,490
 

1329
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:00,790
 exactly how it works you know exactly

1330
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,790
 

1331
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:04,160
 how it works you but it's very simple

1332
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:04,160
 

1333
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:07,640
 nonetheless it is structured so that you

1334
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:07,640
 

1335
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:09,020
 cannot reproduce its outcomes nor

1336
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:09,020
 

1337
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,900
 predict them ahead of time

1338
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:11,900
 

1339
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:13,370
 and that's interesting and I come from a

1340
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:13,370
 

1341
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,960
 computer security background so I can

1342
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,960
 

1343
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:17,230
 talk to you at length about how to build

1344
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:17,230
 

1345
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,299
 a reproducible lottery that

1346
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,299
 

1347
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:21,880
 would be possible to make transparent

1348
00:27:19,289 --> 00:27:21,880
 

1349
00:27:19,299 --> 00:27:24,940
 I'm not going to do that today but I

1350
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:24,940
 

1351
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:28,659
 think it's important to remember this as

1352
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:28,659
 

1353
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:30,970
 an example of things that are not served

1354
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:30,970
 

1355
00:27:28,659 --> 00:27:35,260
 well by transparency as a sole solution

1356
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,260
 

1357
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:37,360
 concept thanks Josh

1358
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,360
 

1359
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:39,250
 so I'm gonna actually go back one slide

1360
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:39,250
 

1361
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,470
 cuz there's a latent explain ability so

1362
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,470
 

1363
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:43,360
 one thing that Josh kind of noted was

1364
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,360
 

1365
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:45,519
 that transparency alone right is an

1366
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,519
 

1367
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,230
 incomplete solution let's imagine that I

1368
00:27:45,509 --> 00:27:47,230
 

1369
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:49,600
 as an individual have an adverse

1370
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,600
 

1371
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:50,889
 decision made about me and the company

1372
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:50,889
 

1373
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,289
 that does I'm going backwards I swear

1374
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:53,289
 

1375
00:27:50,889 --> 00:27:55,269
 and the company that makes this decision

1376
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,269
 

1377
00:27:53,289 --> 00:27:57,250
 about me says hey look my codes online

1378
00:27:55,259 --> 00:27:57,250
 

1379
00:27:55,269 --> 00:27:59,409
 it's transparent you can figure out why

1380
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,409
 

1381
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:02,350
 it occurred does this reasonably make

1382
00:27:59,399 --> 00:28:02,350
 

1383
00:27:59,409 --> 00:28:03,880
 sense for an individual no right it

1384
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,880
 

1385
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:05,590
 assumes a lot of background knowledge I

1386
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:05,590
 

1387
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:07,029
 have to be able to walk is just Python

1388
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,029
 

1389
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:08,380
 but like you have to be able to kind of

1390
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,380
 

1391
00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:11,049
 understand these things that leaves out

1392
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:11,049
 

1393
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:12,549
 the transparent to whom aspect so one

1394
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,549
 

1395
00:28:11,049 --> 00:28:14,200
 thing that happens is folks can say what

1396
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:14,200
 

1397
00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:16,090
 about explain ability it seems a little

1398
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:16,090
 

1399
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,559
 bit stronger than transparency right I

1400
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,559
 

1401
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:19,710
 should at least be able to have a notion

1402
00:28:17,549 --> 00:28:19,710
 

1403
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:23,019
 of how to communicate this out to folks

1404
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,019
 

1405
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:25,059
 but this also sadly suffers from

1406
00:28:23,009 --> 00:28:25,059
 

1407
00:28:23,019 --> 00:28:26,260
 explainable to whom and explainable over

1408
00:28:25,049 --> 00:28:26,260
 

1409
00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:28,389
 what what are you going to choose to

1410
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:28,389
 

1411
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:31,210
 explain and who's the intended audience

1412
00:28:28,379 --> 00:28:31,210
 

1413
00:28:28,389 --> 00:28:32,799
 of it so if we actually even just take a

1414
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,799
 

1415
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:34,990
 fundamental step back right

1416
00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:34,990
 

1417
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,610
 let's actually try to remember or ever

1418
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,610
 

1419
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:39,070
 try to decide what makes an explanation

1420
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,070
 

1421
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:42,340
 and explanation what comprises of the

1422
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:42,340
 

1423
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:44,169
 elements of an explanation luckily

1424
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:44,169
 

1425
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:46,659
 somebody did this work for us

1426
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,659
 

1427
00:28:44,169 --> 00:28:48,880
 this was Miller in 2017 so Miller is a

1428
00:28:46,649 --> 00:28:48,880
 

1429
00:28:46,659 --> 00:28:50,710
 computer scientist by training and he

1430
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:50,710
 

1431
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,450
 actually decided to read over 200 papers

1432
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,450
 

1433
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:54,970
 from the Social Sciences that were about

1434
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,970
 

1435
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:57,309
 explanations to say what makes an

1436
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,309
 

1437
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:58,809
 explanation and explanation because if

1438
00:28:57,299 --> 00:28:58,809
 

1439
00:28:57,309 --> 00:29:00,549
 we want explain ability we should

1440
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,549
 

1441
00:28:58,809 --> 00:29:03,309
 probably know what an explanation is

1442
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:03,309
 

1443
00:29:00,549 --> 00:29:06,010
 right and what Miller found out was that

1444
00:29:03,299 --> 00:29:06,010
 

1445
00:29:03,309 --> 00:29:07,870
 explanations took many forms one form of

1446
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,870
 

1447
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:09,669
 an explanation was a causal explanation

1448
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,669
 

1449
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:10,120
 so this would be like the answer of the

1450
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:10,120
 

1451
00:29:09,669 --> 00:29:13,480
 form

1452
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:13,480
 

1453
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:15,340
 why did event X occur alternatively

1454
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:15,340
 

1455
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:17,409
 explanations can be contrastive so

1456
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:17,409
 

1457
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:19,090
 instead of me saying why did X occur you

1458
00:29:17,399 --> 00:29:19,090
 

1459
00:29:17,409 --> 00:29:21,309
 might say why did event X occur over

1460
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,309
 

1461
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:23,590
 event Y so rather than purely put in on

1462
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:23,590
 

1463
00:29:21,309 --> 00:29:26,860
 why did X in a relationship motion of

1464
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:26,860
 

1465
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:28,990
 contrastive Miller also found that

1466
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,990
 

1467
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:30,610
 explanations were selective in that if

1468
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,610
 

1469
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:30,970
 you were to ask somebody why an event

1470
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:30,970
 

1471
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:32,770
 occur

1472
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,770
 

1473
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:34,539
 they wouldn't give you an exhaustive

1474
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,539
 

1475
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:35,950
 list of every possible thing right if

1476
00:29:34,529 --> 00:29:35,950
 

1477
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:37,690
 you're wondering why I was late today to

1478
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,690
 

1479
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:39,429
 check-in I wouldn't tell you oh well the

1480
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,429
 

1481
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:41,230
 elevator got stuck then I pressed the

1482
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:41,230
 

1483
00:29:39,429 --> 00:29:43,419
 wrong button then I did this oh it was

1484
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,419
 

1485
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:45,370
 raining no folks usually actually just

1486
00:29:43,409 --> 00:29:45,370
 

1487
00:29:43,419 --> 00:29:47,230
 pick out a subset of relevant

1488
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,230
 

1489
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:49,720
 information to actually relay as part of

1490
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,720
 

1491
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:51,400
 the explanation so the set of causes

1492
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:51,400
 

1493
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:55,090
 that are usually explained is by

1494
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:55,090
 

1495
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:57,309
 definition and selective explanations

1496
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,309
 

1497
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:59,020
 are social that's great right because

1498
00:29:57,299 --> 00:29:59,020
 

1499
00:29:57,309 --> 00:30:01,299
 ideally the point of an explanation is

1500
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:01,299
 

1501
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:02,890
 to relay information if it wasn't social

1502
00:30:01,289 --> 00:30:02,890
 

1503
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:06,940
 it'd be doing something very wrong

1504
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,940
 

1505
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:09,309
 and lastly explanations have this dual

1506
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,309
 

1507
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:11,620
 nature where they're both the product

1508
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:11,620
 

1509
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:13,210
 and a process so they're a product in

1510
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,210
 

1511
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:15,789
 the sense that an explanation can be the

1512
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,789
 

1513
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:17,650
 answer to a question but it's a process

1514
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:17,650
 

1515
00:30:15,789 --> 00:30:19,330
 in the fact that it was social it

1516
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,330
 

1517
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:23,470
 transmitted that information to another

1518
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:23,470
 

1519
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:25,510
 beam and because of this we see that you

1520
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,510
 

1521
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:27,250
 need to understand notions of like if an

1522
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,250
 

1523
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:28,570
 explanation is social right your

1524
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,570
 

1525
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:29,650
 explanation might look different if

1526
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,650
 

1527
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:31,059
 you're talking to somebody at this

1528
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,059
 

1529
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:32,429
 conference but if I were trying to

1530
00:30:31,049 --> 00:30:32,429
 

1531
00:30:31,059 --> 00:30:34,929
 explain it to my three-year-old nephew

1532
00:30:32,419 --> 00:30:34,929
 

1533
00:30:32,429 --> 00:30:37,419
 right the audience matter is explainable

1534
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:37,419
 

1535
00:30:34,929 --> 00:30:39,460
 to whom also what am i explaining this

1536
00:30:37,409 --> 00:30:39,460
 

1537
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:45,460
 notion of selectiveness is important to

1538
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:45,460
 

1539
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:49,390
 get at the explainable over what thanks

1540
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:49,390
 

1541
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:51,549
 Danny so we've gone through all the

1542
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,549
 

1543
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:53,770
 terms that we set out at the beginning I

1544
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:53,770
 

1545
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:55,360
 should add as a parenthetical that when

1546
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,360
 

1547
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:56,980
 we started this project we started with

1548
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,980
 

1549
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:00,280
 about ten terms we're not going to bore

1550
00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:00,280
 

1551
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:01,750
 you with all of them today but one of

1552
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,750
 

1553
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,520
 the interesting things we found is some

1554
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,520
 

1555
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:05,260
 interrelationship I talked about socio

1556
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,260
 

1557
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,330
 technical systems so if I use the word

1558
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:07,330
 

1559
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:09,070
 algorithm in this room it means

1560
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,070
 

1561
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:10,510
 something very specific in concrete

1562
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,510
 

1563
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:12,250
 whereas to a social scientist it

1564
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,250
 

1565
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:14,830
 probably means a system that includes

1566
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,830
 

1567
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:16,659
 humans which is a little bit weird from

1568
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,659
 

1569
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:18,940
 a machine learning perspective I think

1570
00:31:16,649 --> 00:31:18,940
 

1571
00:31:16,659 --> 00:31:22,419
 for our background but nonetheless a

1572
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:22,419
 

1573
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:25,270
 totally valid conceptually integral use

1574
00:31:22,409 --> 00:31:25,270
 

1575
00:31:22,419 --> 00:31:30,490
 of language so I want to turn now away

1576
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:30,490
 

1577
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:32,049
 from terms to some takeaway ideas some

1578
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,049
 

1579
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:34,419
 lessons that we can take from the

1580
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:34,419
 

1581
00:31:32,049 --> 00:31:37,659
 different ways that people conceptualize

1582
00:31:34,409 --> 00:31:37,659
 

1583
00:31:34,419 --> 00:31:41,560
 these ideas with different backgrounds

1584
00:31:37,649 --> 00:31:41,560
 

1585
00:31:37,659 --> 00:31:44,320
 and one I think important thing to

1586
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:44,320
 

1587
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:47,530
 remember is that data are not truth it's

1588
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:47,530
 

1589
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:49,720
 easy to go online and download a data

1590
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,720
 

1591
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:51,700
 set and it's already in a csv and you

1592
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:51,700
 

1593
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:54,360
 just throw it into your model and you're

1594
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:54,360
 

1595
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:56,620
 very happy because you've got an answer

1596
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,620
 

1597
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:59,770
 and you got to think about some cool

1598
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:59,770
 

1599
00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:02,470
 machine learning but really what those

1600
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,470
 

1601
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:06,070
 data are an abstraction of the world and

1602
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:06,070
 

1603
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:08,380
 that problem of how do we abstract the

1604
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:08,380
 

1605
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:12,610
 world into data is a really hard problem

1606
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:12,610
 

1607
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:15,060
 that every field that uses data in an

1608
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,060
 

1609
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:18,010
 empirical way so computer science

1610
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:18,010
 

1611
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:19,840
 physical sciences Social Sciences all

1612
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,840
 

1613
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:23,230
 have to grapple with this problem of

1614
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:23,230
 

1615
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:25,210
 measurement and Hannah is nodding

1616
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,210
 

1617
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:28,150
 vigorously I give her all credit for

1618
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,150
 

1619
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:29,860
 this but I I'll give you a quick

1620
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,860
 

1621
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:31,780
 anecdote about measurement and that

1622
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:31,780
 

1623
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:33,270
 anecdote is about this man in the upper

1624
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:33,270
 

1625
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:36,310
 left whose name is Lewis fry Richardson

1626
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:36,310
 

1627
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:39,900
 there's a British mathematician he was

1628
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:39,900
 

1629
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:42,040
 very interested in the question of how

1630
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:42,040
 

1631
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:44,260
 countries he was interested in applying

1632
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:44,260
 

1633
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,880
 statistics to political science and he

1634
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:45,880
 

1635
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:48,610
 was interested specifically in the

1636
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:48,610
 

1637
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:50,910
 question of whether the length of a

1638
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,910
 

1639
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:55,750
 national border between two countries

1640
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:55,750
 

1641
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:57,250
 would predict in some way the likelihood

1642
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,250
 

1643
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:59,710
 that those two countries would go to war

1644
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,710
 

1645
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:01,240
 over their whole history and so he

1646
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,240
 

1647
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:03,880
 gathered a bunch of historical border

1648
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:03,880
 

1649
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:05,620
 data and set to work trying to put

1650
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:05,620
 

1651
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,540
 together the regressions necessary to

1652
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:07,540
 

1653
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:09,340
 answer this question as he was doing

1654
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:09,340
 

1655
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:11,100
 that he noticed something very odd about

1656
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:11,100
 

1657
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:15,070
 the border between Spain and Portugal

1658
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:15,070
 

1659
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:17,980
 which is that when he looked at the

1660
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,980
 

1661
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:20,350
 Portuguese reporting on the border it

1662
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:20,350
 

1663
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:22,390
 said the border was 970 kilometers long

1664
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,390
 

1665
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:24,490
 when he looked at the Spanish reporting

1666
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,490
 

1667
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:26,020
 on the border it said that the border

1668
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,020
 

1669
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:27,820
 was twelve hundred and thirty kilometers

1670
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:27,820
 

1671
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:31,060
 long which was a difference of over 20

1672
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:31,060
 

1673
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:33,040
 percent so that's a little bit weird

1674
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:33,040
 

1675
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:34,360
 right if I am standing at the border

1676
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:34,360
 

1677
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,100
 between Spain and Portugal and I walk

1678
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:36,100
 

1679
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:39,400
 across the border it does not suddenly

1680
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:39,400
 

1681
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:42,010
 become 200 kilometers longer what

1682
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:42,010
 

1683
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:43,900
 instead happens is that the border is

1684
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,900
 

1685
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:46,300
 measured in a physical process that

1686
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:46,300
 

1687
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:48,130
 process involves taking planes and

1688
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,130
 

1689
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:49,840
 flying over the border and taking aerial

1690
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,840
 

1691
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:51,080
 photographs and then blowing those

1692
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,080
 

1693
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,059
 aerial photographs up really

1694
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,059
 

1695
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:56,570
 big on a table and using physical

1696
00:33:53,049 --> 00:33:56,570
 

1697
00:33:53,059 --> 00:34:02,059
 cartographers tools to measure the where

1698
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:02,059
 

1699
00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:03,649
 the border is on that image and Lewis

1700
00:34:02,049 --> 00:34:03,649
 

1701
00:34:02,059 --> 00:34:05,179
 fry Richardson looked into this and

1702
00:34:03,639 --> 00:34:05,179
 

1703
00:34:03,649 --> 00:34:07,399
 discovered that the lengths that you

1704
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:07,399
 

1705
00:34:05,179 --> 00:34:09,129
 measure when you do this depends on how

1706
00:34:07,389 --> 00:34:09,129
 

1707
00:34:07,399 --> 00:34:12,470
 much you blow the photograph up on how

1708
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,470
 

1709
00:34:09,129 --> 00:34:15,530
 fine the gradations are on your tools on

1710
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:15,530
 

1711
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:17,869
 how skilled you are at matching up from

1712
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,869
 

1713
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:19,580
 one photograph to the next so he wrote a

1714
00:34:17,859 --> 00:34:19,580
 

1715
00:34:17,869 --> 00:34:22,780
 sort of a research note about this

1716
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:22,780
 

1717
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:26,810
 little curiosity in his data that note

1718
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:26,810
 

1719
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:29,419
 you might realize foreshadowed or

1720
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,419
 

1721
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:31,639
 inspired work by another mathematician

1722
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:31,639
 

1723
00:34:29,419 --> 00:34:33,379
 Benoit Mandelbrot who later wrote a

1724
00:34:31,629 --> 00:34:33,379
 

1725
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:35,179
 paper called how long as the coastline

1726
00:34:33,369 --> 00:34:35,179
 

1727
00:34:33,379 --> 00:34:38,899
 of England in which he introduced a

1728
00:34:35,169 --> 00:34:38,899
 

1729
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:43,159
 bunch of what we now understand to be

1730
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:43,159
 

1731
00:34:38,899 --> 00:34:45,649
 the theory of fractals and now you might

1732
00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:45,649
 

1733
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:48,530
 be thinking because of that you might

1734
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:48,530
 

1735
00:34:45,649 --> 00:34:51,710
 say well Josh length you know it seems

1736
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:51,710
 

1737
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:55,099
 like it's an easy conceptually integral

1738
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:55,099
 

1739
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:58,130
 concept that nonetheless has this sort

1740
00:34:55,089 --> 00:34:58,130
 

1741
00:34:55,099 --> 00:35:00,320
 of strange mathematical bug right we

1742
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,320
 

1743
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:02,000
 know that if the house Dorf dimension of

1744
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:02,000
 

1745
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,660
 a curve is strictly larger than its

1746
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:05,660
 

1747
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,450
 topological dimension that the behavior

1748
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:08,450
 

1749
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:13,070
 of measuring length along that curve is

1750
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:13,070
 

1751
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:15,380
 weird and sort of poorly not not poorly

1752
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,380
 

1753
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:18,170
 conceptualized but but it behaves poorly

1754
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:18,170
 

1755
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:20,630
 it's probably behaved and and it leads

1756
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,630
 

1757
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:23,270
 to these weirdnesses and the only kind

1758
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:23,270
 

1759
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:24,410
 of mathematically useful answer that we

1760
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,410
 

1761
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:26,839
 can come up with is that the curve is

1762
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,839
 

1763
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:29,150
 infinitely long which which is not a

1764
00:35:26,829 --> 00:35:29,150
 

1765
00:35:26,839 --> 00:35:32,060
 useful answer for the purpose of this

1766
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:32,060
 

1767
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:34,849
 study but I put to you that if length is

1768
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:34,849
 

1769
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:37,690
 difficult to measure and yet it seems so

1770
00:35:34,839 --> 00:35:37,690
 

1771
00:35:34,849 --> 00:35:39,859
 easy that maybe all sorts of physical

1772
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,859
 

1773
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:42,530
 phenomena are actually hard to measure

1774
00:35:39,849 --> 00:35:42,530
 

1775
00:35:39,859 --> 00:35:44,450
 and in fact social phenomena are hard to

1776
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,450
 

1777
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:46,520
 measure because the physical phenomena

1778
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,520
 

1779
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:47,960
 are at least observable right we can go

1780
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,960
 

1781
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:50,630
 out we can observe them we can build

1782
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:50,630
 

1783
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:52,010
 tools that observe them but lots of the

1784
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,010
 

1785
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:55,040
 concepts that we want to capture with

1786
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,040
 

1787
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:56,540
 machine learning or with scoring systems

1788
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,540
 

1789
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,220
 of one kind or another are unobservable

1790
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:58,220
 

1791
00:35:56,540 --> 00:36:01,970
 concepts they're purely theoretical

1792
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:01,970
 

1793
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:02,950
 concepts they don't exist outside of our

1794
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,950
 

1795
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:06,060
 models these

1796
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:06,060
 

1797
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:09,160
 concepts like risk like intelligence

1798
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:09,160
 

1799
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:14,079
 like how much a student has learned in a

1800
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:14,079
 

1801
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:16,930
 class propensity to crime things like

1802
00:36:14,069 --> 00:36:16,930
 

1803
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:18,369
 this and this is not a new problem this

1804
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,369
 

1805
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:19,750
 is not a problem that machine learning

1806
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:19,750
 

1807
00:36:18,369 --> 00:36:21,670
 has hit for the first time this is a

1808
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,670
 

1809
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:23,920
 problem that social scientists people

1810
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,920
 

1811
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:26,050
 who design tests especially are very

1812
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:26,050
 

1813
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,900
 interested in this problem and they've

1814
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,900
 

1815
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:30,670
 come up with not a solution but at least

1816
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:30,670
 

1817
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:32,320
 an approach to reasoning about this

1818
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,320
 

1819
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:34,720
 problem that goes by the name of

1820
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:34,720
 

1821
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:38,859
 construct validity so construct validity

1822
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:38,859
 

1823
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:40,780
 contains a lot of the the validation

1824
00:36:38,849 --> 00:36:40,780
 

1825
00:36:38,859 --> 00:36:44,490
 that we do of our models in terms of

1826
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:44,490
 

1827
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:49,540
 measuring predictive accuracy looking at

1828
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:49,540
 

1829
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:50,920
 the various rates of performance of the

1830
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:50,920
 

1831
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:53,400
 model various measures of performance

1832
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:53,400
 

1833
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:56,470
 but it contains other things too like

1834
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:56,470
 

1835
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:58,810
 validating that the mechanisms that are

1836
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,810
 

1837
00:36:56,470 --> 00:37:02,410
 captured in a model or in a construct

1838
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,410
 

1839
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:03,760
 match up with a coherent theory match up

1840
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,760
 

1841
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:08,680
 with other work that's been done by

1842
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:08,680
 

1843
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:10,420
 other people on on the idea and I won't

1844
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:10,420
 

1845
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:12,099
 talk in detail about construct validity

1846
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:12,099
 

1847
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:14,109
 I just want to point it out to you there

1848
00:37:12,089 --> 00:37:14,109
 

1849
00:37:12,099 --> 00:37:16,240
 are several authors depending on who you

1850
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:16,240
 

1851
00:37:14,109 --> 00:37:18,910
 read there are something like five to

1852
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,910
 

1853
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:21,010
 nine ways that you can define construct

1854
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,010
 

1855
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:22,030
 validity different approaches to talking

1856
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,030
 

1857
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:24,660
 about validity and I think it's

1858
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,660
 

1859
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:27,760
 important when we do machine learning to

1860
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:27,760
 

1861
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:29,470
 understand that when we measure accuracy

1862
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,470
 

1863
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:33,130
 and precision and recall and and all the

1864
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:33,130
 

1865
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:35,410
 measures that we use we're not done we

1866
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,410
 

1867
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:39,099
 haven't fully fleshed out the

1868
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:39,099
 

1869
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:44,530
 performance of a model in that by doing

1870
00:37:39,089 --> 00:37:44,530
 

1871
00:37:39,099 --> 00:37:46,119
 that kind of analysis so just as Josh

1872
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,119
 

1873
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:47,770
 was talking about right data is an

1874
00:37:46,109 --> 00:37:47,770
 

1875
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:50,260
 abstraction and measurement can do these

1876
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,260
 

1877
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:52,420
 weird funky things it's important to

1878
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:52,420
 

1879
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:54,460
 remember that just as data abstractions

1880
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:54,460
 

1881
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:56,859
 of the world models are abstractions of

1882
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:56,859
 

1883
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:58,180
 data and because of that it kind of

1884
00:37:56,849 --> 00:37:58,180
 

1885
00:37:56,859 --> 00:37:59,650
 leads to this notion that you know

1886
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,650
 

1887
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:02,740
 models are really nothing more than

1888
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,740
 

1889
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:04,390
 mathematical fictions right they allow

1890
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:04,390
 

1891
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:06,040
 us to formally reason about the world

1892
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,040
 

1893
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:07,990
 because in order to formally reason with

1894
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,990
 

1895
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:10,390
 math you do need mathematical objects

1896
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,390
 

1897
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:12,339
 but but they can be wrong and I do

1898
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,339
 

1899
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:13,750
 concede this point right like I'm a game

1900
00:38:12,329 --> 00:38:13,750
 

1901
00:38:12,339 --> 00:38:15,320
 theorist by training the utility

1902
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,320
 

1903
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:17,150
 functions that I work with for it

1904
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:17,150
 

1905
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,770
 a devotee our fictions are compact

1906
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,770
 

1907
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:21,620
 representations that allow me to

1908
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,620
 

1909
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:22,100
 understand the world but that's a thing

1910
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:22,100
 

1911
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,840
 right

1912
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:23,840
 

1913
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:26,030
 mathematical fictions are just that

1914
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:26,030
 

1915
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,750
 they're their models they that's all

1916
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:26,750
 

1917
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:27,920
 they are

1918
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:27,920
 

1919
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:31,100
 don't let the math cloud your thinking

1920
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:31,100
 

1921
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:38,320
 basically the world adapts to everything

1922
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:38,320
 

1923
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:40,490
 that's around you so with that I will

1924
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:40,490
 

1925
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,860
 kind of drive home this idea that

1926
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,860
 

1927
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:45,500
 there's no actual substitute for solving

1928
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:45,500
 

1929
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:47,720
 the problem that you that you have which

1930
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,720
 

1931
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:49,520
 involves thinking hard about what

1932
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:49,520
 

1933
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:51,770
 problem you have and then and then

1934
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:51,770
 

1935
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:54,230
 solving it and too often we outsource

1936
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,230
 

1937
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:55,280
 the problem in some way and I see now

1938
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,280
 

1939
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:57,320
 that we've talked about construct

1940
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:57,320
 

1941
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:01,190
 validity Hannah's going to leave I knew

1942
00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:01,190
 

1943
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:05,810
 that was coming but glad you were here

1944
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:05,810
 

1945
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:09,260
 at least for that part the so too often

1946
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,260
 

1947
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:11,840
 we outsource either defining the problem

1948
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:11,840
 

1949
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:13,340
 or solving the problem in some way so

1950
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:13,340
 

1951
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:15,890
 the simplest way we do that is we

1952
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:15,890
 

1953
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:18,020
 outsource solving the problem to data so

1954
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,020
 

1955
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:21,650
 we said we don't know what patterns in

1956
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:21,650
 

1957
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:23,210
 this data are are useful or even where

1958
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,210
 

1959
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:24,890
 the patterns are or how to look for them

1960
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,890
 

1961
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:26,090
 but the machine learning algorithm knows

1962
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,090
 

1963
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:27,560
 the machine learning algorithm can tell

1964
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,560
 

1965
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:28,850
 us we'll just apply it to the data and

1966
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:28,850
 

1967
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:31,220
 it will come back with the patterns and

1968
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,220
 

1969
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:33,920
 we'll say here you know here's a you

1970
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:33,920
 

1971
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:38,420
 know a trend line or a rule that you can

1972
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:38,420
 

1973
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:41,930
 apply that generalizes pretty well but

1974
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:41,930
 

1975
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:43,850
 that doesn't actually tell us about the

1976
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,850
 

1977
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:49,310
 phenomenon that we're considering it

1978
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:49,310
 

1979
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:52,460
 doesn't answer a question and similarly

1980
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:52,460
 

1981
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:55,580
 we often outsource problems to end-users

1982
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:55,580
 

1983
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:58,220
 so maybe imagine a scoring system which

1984
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:58,220
 

1985
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:59,780
 generates a score so you there's some

1986
00:39:58,210 --> 00:39:59,780
 

1987
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:02,540
 curve that's generated by the scoring

1988
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:02,540
 

1989
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:04,610
 system which represents the the

1990
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:04,610
 

1991
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:07,490
 phenomenon under consideration maybe

1992
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,490
 

1993
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:12,440
 risk of criminal recidivism let's say

1994
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:12,440
 

1995
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:14,180
 just for concreteness so when we try to

1996
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:14,180
 

1997
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,770
 use that curve to put people into

1998
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:15,770
 

1999
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:17,270
 categories so we want to use that curve

2000
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,270
 

2001
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:19,040
 to say these people are high risk and

2002
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,040
 

2003
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:23,410
 these people are low risk and we're

2004
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:23,410
 

2005
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:25,780
 going to divide them as such

2006
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,780
 

2007
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:27,550
 and treat them differently based on that

2008
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:27,550
 

2009
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:30,310
 division we're gonna outsource that

2010
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:30,310
 

2011
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:34,480
 fresh holding to to a customer to a

2012
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:34,480
 

2013
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:37,810
 consumer of a model to some user of the

2014
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:37,810
 

2015
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:39,640
 of the model and they're going to set

2016
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,640
 

2017
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:41,140
 the threshold and because they set the

2018
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,140
 

2019
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:44,830
 threshold it's not our responsibility to

2020
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:44,830
 

2021
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:47,410
 set the threshold and nonetheless by

2022
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,410
 

2023
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:50,740
 doing that we've not thought about what

2024
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,740
 

2025
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:52,240
 are the fitness of the models we have of

2026
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:52,240
 

2027
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:54,430
 the parameters we've set in those models

2028
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:54,430
 

2029
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:57,220
 of the defaults we've set in our

2030
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:57,220
 

2031
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:59,650
 products for any given purpose it's

2032
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:59,650
 

2033
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:01,660
 important to think about those things

2034
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,660
 

2035
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:03,280
 and communicate the limitations of the

2036
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:03,280
 

2037
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:05,260
 tools to the people who are ultimately

2038
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:05,260
 

2039
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:07,960
 going to use them to do some important

2040
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:07,960
 

2041
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:09,310
 thing in the world before we do that we

2042
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:09,310
 

2043
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:12,160
 have to be able to understand the

2044
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,160
 

2045
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:13,840
 problem that means that we have to take

2046
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:13,840
 

2047
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,400
 these abstractions that we've built the

2048
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:15,400
 

2049
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,960
 datasets that we have the models we

2050
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:16,960
 

2051
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,910
 build out of them we have to connect

2052
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:18,910
 

2053
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,820
 them back to the world we have to think

2054
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,820
 

2055
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:23,800
 about construct validity one way to do

2056
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:23,800
 

2057
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:25,660
 that may be to involve domain experts to

2058
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:25,660
 

2059
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,190
 go out to people who actually have world

2060
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,190
 

2061
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:29,500
 knowledge who've spent their careers

2062
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:29,500
 

2063
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:32,490
 developing knowledge about criminology

2064
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:32,490
 

2065
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:35,790
 or teaching students or healthcare

2066
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,790
 

2067
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:38,230
 whatever it is bring them in and say hey

2068
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:38,230
 

2069
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:40,450
 these patterns that came out of the data

2070
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,450
 

2071
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:42,730
 are these real patterns are the noise

2072
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,730
 

2073
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:45,520
 patterns can I trust them are they gonna

2074
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,520
 

2075
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:47,710
 fall apart are they robust all the

2076
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:47,710
 

2077
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:52,240
 things that we want out of these systems

2078
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:52,240
 

2079
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:53,650
 so I'm going to turn now away from this

2080
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:53,650
 

2081
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:58,090
 sort of theoretical discussion and

2082
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:58,090
 

2083
00:41:53,650 --> 00:42:02,650
 toward a concrete set of cases that men

2084
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:02,650
 

2085
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:04,450
 and I put together around how we might

2086
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,450
 

2087
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:07,470
 apply some of the ideas that we've

2088
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,470
 

2089
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:10,210
 talked about for the last 45 minutes to

2090
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:10,210
 

2091
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:13,870
 two real machine learning systems and so

2092
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,870
 

2093
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:15,850
 the first case is a rating system a risk

2094
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,850
 

2095
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:19,450
 rating system for babysitters

2096
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:19,450
 

2097
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:22,780
 so imagine some company we'll call it X

2098
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,780
 

2099
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:25,480
 Corp is launching a new service and the

2100
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:25,480
 

2101
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:27,400
 way this service works is people feed

2102
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:27,400
 

2103
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:30,430
 their social media data into the service

2104
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:30,430
 

2105
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:32,800
 and it predicts whether

2106
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:32,800
 

2107
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:34,119
 or not that person is likely to be a

2108
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:34,119
 

2109
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,550
 good babysitter well what's a good

2110
00:42:34,109 --> 00:42:36,550
 

2111
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:38,650
 babysitter is someone who doesn't abuse

2112
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,650
 

2113
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:40,059
 drugs and someone who doesn't have other

2114
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,059
 

2115
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:42,849
 undesirable tendencies like

2116
00:42:40,049 --> 00:42:42,849
 

2117
00:42:40,059 --> 00:42:46,300
 aggressiveness or disrespectfulness that

2118
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:46,300
 

2119
00:42:42,849 --> 00:42:49,329
 we might care about to hire to supervise

2120
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:49,329
 

2121
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:51,490
 our children so using machine learning

2122
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:51,490
 

2123
00:42:49,329 --> 00:42:53,410
 and other computational techniques X

2124
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,410
 

2125
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:57,130
 corpse product is going to produce a

2126
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:57,130
 

2127
00:42:53,410 --> 00:43:01,900
 score from 1 to 5 and display this to

2128
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:01,900
 

2129
00:42:57,130 --> 00:43:04,510
 the hiring parent and so a question that

2130
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:04,510
 

2131
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:06,670
 I want to put to you is to think about

2132
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,670
 

2133
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:09,490
 this case which I'll put back up in a

2134
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:09,490
 

2135
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:13,150
 second with your neighbor talk for two

2136
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:13,150
 

2137
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:14,849
 minutes about this case how what you

2138
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,849
 

2139
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:16,990
 think of it how it makes you feel

2140
00:43:14,839 --> 00:43:16,990
 

2141
00:43:14,849 --> 00:43:20,260
 whether this approach that I've

2142
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:20,260
 

2143
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:22,210
 described is sort of valid in the way

2144
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:22,210
 

2145
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:24,730
 that we would need it to be to solve the

2146
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,730
 

2147
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:28,390
 problem that it's supposed to solve and

2148
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,390
 

2149
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:30,520
 then also what concerns might we have

2150
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,520
 

2151
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:32,260
 about such a tool and who might have

2152
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:32,260
 

2153
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:35,460
 those concerns so go ahead and take two

2154
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:35,460
 

2155
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:38,319
 minutes now and talk to your neighbor or

2156
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:38,319
 

2157
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:43,599
 text with someone signal whatever

2158
00:43:38,309 --> 00:43:43,599
 

2159
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:45,220
 whatever it is you do go ahead bomb

2160
00:43:43,589 --> 00:43:45,220
 

2161
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:47,970
 solving is a team sport make a friend

2162
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:47,970
 

2163
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:47,970
 you know like

2164
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:54,140
 

2165
00:43:54,150 --> 00:44:00,289
 if you have no neighbor Adrian is down

2166
00:43:56,120 --> 00:44:00,289
 

2167
00:43:56,130 --> 00:44:00,289
 here in the front he can join your group

2168
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:44,580
 

2169
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:47,950
 we'll start now

2170
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:14,980
 

2171
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:18,060
[Music]

2172
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:34,410
 

2173
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:38,310
 I'll take 37 offers 36 something you'll

2174
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:38,310
 

2175
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:41,340
 be better off

2176
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:41,340
 

2177
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:44,180
 so what am I saying here we just brought

2178
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:44,180
 

2179
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:44,180
 down possible things

2180
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:02,020
 

2181
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:05,290
 last 30 seconds

2182
00:46:13,799 --> 00:46:13,799
 

2183
00:46:13,809 --> 00:46:24,339
 all right let's come back together so I

2184
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,339
 

2185
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:26,569
 want to start by describing a couple of

2186
00:46:24,329 --> 00:46:26,569
 

2187
00:46:24,339 --> 00:46:32,359
 thoughts that that we had about this

2188
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:32,359
 

2189
00:46:26,569 --> 00:46:36,309
 question one being that this is a static

2190
00:46:32,349 --> 00:46:36,309
 

2191
00:46:32,359 --> 00:46:38,749
 approach that there's a sort of adapt

2192
00:46:36,299 --> 00:46:38,749
 

2193
00:46:36,309 --> 00:46:40,880
 adaptiveness to the world when we put

2194
00:46:38,739 --> 00:46:40,880
 

2195
00:46:38,749 --> 00:46:42,619
 measures on the world it sort of tends

2196
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:42,619
 

2197
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:46,130
 to respond in a way that makes those

2198
00:46:42,609 --> 00:46:46,130
 

2199
00:46:42,619 --> 00:46:47,989
 measures arbitrage away or or disappear

2200
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,989
 

2201
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:50,900
 or become less useful this idea has a

2202
00:46:47,979 --> 00:46:50,900
 

2203
00:46:47,989 --> 00:46:54,499
 name in economics people call it good

2204
00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:54,499
 

2205
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:56,480
 hearts law so that's worth remembering

2206
00:46:54,489 --> 00:46:56,480
 

2207
00:46:54,499 --> 00:46:58,220
 that if we deployed such a system people

2208
00:46:56,470 --> 00:46:58,220
 

2209
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:02,900
 would change their behavior change their

2210
00:46:58,210 --> 00:47:02,900
 

2211
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:04,130
 social media posting behavior to deal

2212
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:04,130
 

2213
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:08,210
 with the way that it might affect their

2214
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:08,210
 

2215
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:09,319
 lives and then similarly you have a sort

2216
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,319
 

2217
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:12,499
 of a question about how would you

2218
00:47:09,309 --> 00:47:12,499
 

2219
00:47:09,319 --> 00:47:16,430
 evaluate the robustness so how if I'm

2220
00:47:12,489 --> 00:47:16,430
 

2221
00:47:12,499 --> 00:47:18,380
 you know a five out of five today how do

2222
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:18,380
 

2223
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:21,759
 you know that I'm not a two out of five

2224
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:21,759
 

2225
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:24,650
 tomorrow and the other way around

2226
00:47:21,749 --> 00:47:24,650
 

2227
00:47:21,759 --> 00:47:26,779
 what what does what what do these scores

2228
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,779
 

2229
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:29,180
 mean and and and how do we know that

2230
00:47:26,769 --> 00:47:29,180
 

2231
00:47:26,779 --> 00:47:34,190
 they're they're stable where do they

2232
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:34,190
 

2233
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:37,759
 come from and so let's move on from this

2234
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:37,759
 

2235
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:38,569
 question to another question so oh yeah

2236
00:47:37,749 --> 00:47:38,569
 

2237
00:47:37,759 --> 00:47:41,230
 sorry

2238
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:41,230
 

2239
00:47:38,569 --> 00:47:43,789
 did anyone anyone have any other ideas

2240
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:43,789
 

2241
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:44,779
 about that you can just raise your hand

2242
00:47:43,779 --> 00:47:44,779
 

2243
00:47:43,789 --> 00:47:46,369
 and then shout them at me and I'll

2244
00:47:44,769 --> 00:47:46,369
 

2245
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:49,839
 repeat them because it's a big huge room

2246
00:47:46,359 --> 00:47:49,839
 

2247
00:47:46,369 --> 00:47:49,839
 yes in the red shirt

2248
00:48:04,569 --> 00:48:04,569
 

2249
00:48:04,579 --> 00:48:09,960
 or it is okay cool so personal

2250
00:48:07,609 --> 00:48:09,960
 

2251
00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:12,329
 professional behavior they're not

2252
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:12,329
 

2253
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:14,730
 perfect signals because how you behave

2254
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:14,730
 

2255
00:48:12,329 --> 00:48:16,349
 in your personal life is not necessarily

2256
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,349
 

2257
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:18,180
 the same as you would behave in your

2258
00:48:16,339 --> 00:48:18,180
 

2259
00:48:16,349 --> 00:48:21,869
 professional life also using social

2260
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:21,869
 

2261
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:24,900
 media doesn't necessarily there's a lot

2262
00:48:21,859 --> 00:48:24,900
 

2263
00:48:21,869 --> 00:48:27,329
 of noise there and it indiscriminately

2264
00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:27,329
 

2265
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:29,220
 would punish people who are more open on

2266
00:48:27,319 --> 00:48:29,220
 

2267
00:48:27,329 --> 00:48:31,710
 social media versus maybe there are

2268
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:31,710
 

2269
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:33,540
 individuals were despicable who don't

2270
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,540
 

2271
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:35,700
 share an often social media that might

2272
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:35,700
 

2273
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:39,359
 just get away with it so and I can keep

2274
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:39,359
 

2275
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:42,300
 going on but yeah I think that's exactly

2276
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:42,300
 

2277
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:45,900
 right but social media data maybe does

2278
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:45,900
 

2279
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:49,230
 not capture the kinds of you know

2280
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:49,230
 

2281
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:54,450
 inherent despicable mr. with some sort

2282
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:54,450
 

2283
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:56,280
 of score like this so moving on to to

2284
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,280
 

2285
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:59,839
 another question take I don't know

2286
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:59,839
 

2287
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:03,359
 another thirty Seconds to a minute to

2288
00:48:59,829 --> 00:49:03,359
 

2289
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:05,520
 talk about what it might mean for the

2290
00:49:03,349 --> 00:49:05,520
 

2291
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:07,680
 system to be fair if we said we want the

2292
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:07,680
 

2293
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:09,020
 system to be fair how would we

2294
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:09,020
 

2295
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:12,150
 operationalize that what would it mean

2296
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:12,150
 

2297
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:13,770
 so go ahead and just quickly chat about

2298
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:13,770
 

2299
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:17,810
 that and then we'll bring us back

2300
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:17,810
 

2301
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:17,810
 together in about 30 seconds

2302
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:27,300
 

2303
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:29,820
 yes

2304
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:29,910
 

2305
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:35,099
 let's go see

2306
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:35,099
 

2307
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:35,099
 hot corners

2308
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:52,040
 

2309
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:58,890
 alright friends let's let's talk what it

2310
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,890
 

2311
00:50:55,770 --> 00:51:00,300
 would mean for this system to be fair so

2312
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,300
 

2313
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:02,700
 I'm curious that what you all thought

2314
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:02,700
 

2315
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:03,720
 about if anybody's brave and want to

2316
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:03,720
 

2317
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:05,210
 raise their hand I can repeat the

2318
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:05,210
 

2319
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:08,490
 question or repeat what they said here

2320
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,490
 

2321
00:51:05,210 --> 00:51:10,590
 or I can start to whichever what would

2322
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,590
 

2323
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:22,020
 it take for this system for babysitter a

2324
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:22,020
 

2325
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:23,580
 risk prediction to seem fair yes okay

2326
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:23,580
 

2327
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:26,100
 I'm gonna keep coming up because this is

2328
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:26,100
 

2329
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:29,700
 the kind of work that I do for most of

2330
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:29,700
 

2331
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:30,930
 my work anyways so like a feedback

2332
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:30,930
 

2333
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:32,910
 system would be something that's useful

2334
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,910
 

2335
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:35,730
 and and I guess you guys sort of alluded

2336
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:35,730
 

2337
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:36,930
 to that but my colleague and I Mike and

2338
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:36,930
 

2339
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:39,300
 I sort of got into an interesting

2340
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,300
 

2341
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:41,430
 discussion where feedback systems are

2342
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:41,430
 

2343
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:43,890
 inherently polarized when it comes to

2344
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:43,890
 

2345
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:45,420
 how ratings are distributed like the

2346
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,420
 

2347
00:51:43,890 --> 00:51:47,010
 canonical example for that being over

2348
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:47,010
 

2349
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:48,570
 ratings like you have to have a really

2350
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,570
 

2351
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:50,820
 really really really really horrible

2352
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,820
 

2353
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:51,870
 experience to give someone a one and if

2354
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:51,870
 

2355
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:53,090
 you have a moderately horrible

2356
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:53,090
 

2357
00:51:51,870 --> 00:51:55,340
 experience you give someone a four

2358
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:55,340
 

2359
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:58,800
 everything else is a five so that

2360
00:51:55,330 --> 00:51:58,800
 

2361
00:51:55,340 --> 00:52:00,600
 bucketing on the scoring system like it

2362
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:00,600
 

2363
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,010
 doesn't really work and and I guess like

2364
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:02,010
 

2365
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:05,160
 what Mike and I were talking about was

2366
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,160
 

2367
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:07,350
 that we're as humans sympathetic to each

2368
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:07,350
 

2369
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:11,010
 other and that sympathy doesn't

2370
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:11,010
 

2371
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:13,410
 translate well into a rating scale or a

2372
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,410
 

2373
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:15,570
 number system so anyways I don't know

2374
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,570
 

2375
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:17,580
 like feedback tools could be an

2376
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,580
 

2377
00:52:15,570 --> 00:52:19,860
 effective way or perceived effective way

2378
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:19,860
 

2379
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:22,680
 to do it but it has like a bunch of

2380
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:22,680
 

2381
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:23,940
 flaws I like that idea kind of kind of

2382
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:23,940
 

2383
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:26,700
 the notion that we had before about

2384
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:26,700
 

2385
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:31,970
 fairness maybe more as a process any

2386
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:31,970
 

2387
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:31,970
 other ideas yeah

2388
00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:35,810
 

2389
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:41,430
 I think that in order for this system to

2390
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:41,430
 

2391
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:43,920
 be fair it needs to give an indication

2392
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:43,920
 

2393
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:47,940
 of how this person would perform as a

2394
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:47,940
 

2395
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:51,000
 babysitter and that is not actually what

2396
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:51,000
 

2397
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:53,340
 the way you framed it in the beginning

2398
00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:53,340
 

2399
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,840
 you are framing it in terms of whether

2400
00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:54,840
 

2401
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:57,120
 they do drugs or whether they sometimes

2402
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:57,120
 

2403
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:59,670
 speak in an angry way to some some of

2404
00:52:57,110 --> 00:52:59,670
 

2405
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:01,980
 their friends or something and that's

2406
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:01,980
 

2407
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:04,620
 not actually what the end user cares

2408
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:04,620
 

2409
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:07,410
 about that that person could be horrible

2410
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:07,410
 

2411
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:09,210
 to their friends all they want and as

2412
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:09,210
 

2413
00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:11,040
 long as they do a good job of being a

2414
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,040
 

2415
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:13,560
 babysitter the the end user doesn't care

2416
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:13,560
 

2417
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:15,360
 right I see so one way we can take that

2418
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:15,360
 

2419
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:16,620
 is to think about maybe the contract

2420
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:16,620
 

2421
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:18,510
 we're measuring wasn't appropriate for

2422
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:18,510
 

2423
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:21,210
 it and also thinking about fairness from

2424
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:21,210
 

2425
00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:25,550
 the individual potential employee point

2426
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:25,550
 

2427
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:25,550
 of view I like that that's great yeah

2428
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:27,070
 

2429
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:31,770
 any system which generalizes too much

2430
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,770
 

2431
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:34,500
 and says that there's a five factors

2432
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,500
 

2433
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:36,870
 which make a good babysitter or whatever

2434
00:53:34,490 --> 00:53:36,870
 

2435
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:38,420
 they tend to oversimplify the problem

2436
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:38,420
 

2437
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:41,220
 it's very easy to get like a bad

2438
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:41,220
 

2439
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:43,290
 prediction and that's like for any

2440
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:43,290
 

2441
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:45,720
 system like this to be fair you have to

2442
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,720
 

2443
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:46,980
 have some kind of appeals process where

2444
00:53:45,710 --> 00:53:46,980
 

2445
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:50,130
 you get your specific information

2446
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:50,130
 

2447
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:52,500
 reviewed to see if it's some exception

2448
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:52,500
 

2449
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:53,880
 to the rule right I like that idea

2450
00:53:52,490 --> 00:53:53,880
 

2451
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:55,320
 so that actually ties with some stuff

2452
00:53:53,870 --> 00:53:55,320
 

2453
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:56,610
 that Josh and I wrote down so I'll just

2454
00:53:55,310 --> 00:53:56,610
 

2455
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:58,740
 tell you what Josh and I kind of thought

2456
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,740
 

2457
00:53:56,610 --> 00:54:00,060
 about this so we thought that we could

2458
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:00,060
 

2459
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:01,830
 look at fairness kind of more to light a

2460
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:01,830
 

2461
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:03,780
 little micro level and at a macro level

2462
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:03,780
 

2463
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:06,300
 so when we thought about the macro level

2464
00:54:03,770 --> 00:54:06,300
 

2465
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:08,370
 we could say that for example like it

2466
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:08,370
 

2467
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:09,840
 would like our be grading people

2468
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:09,840
 

2469
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,950
 accurately could be one notion of

2470
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:10,950
 

2471
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:13,350
 fairness and let's see let's hear this

2472
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:13,350
 

2473
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:15,720
 out right because you don't want to tag

2474
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:15,720
 

2475
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:17,040
 me as being a drug offender if I'm not a

2476
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,040
 

2477
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:19,680
 drug offender that would be particularly

2478
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:19,680
 

2479
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:20,970
 unfair to me as an individual but if we

2480
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:20,970
 

2481
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,590
 think more at the macro level on a

2482
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,590
 

2483
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:25,230
 higher level about this babysitting is

2484
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:25,230
 

2485
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:26,700
 actually low-wage work and it might be

2486
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:26,700
 

2487
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:28,350
 the case that babysitter's don't have

2488
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:28,350
 

2489
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:30,000
 much of a say in this to opt-in or

2490
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:30,000
 

2491
00:54:28,350 --> 00:54:31,770
 anything in general so it creates this

2492
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:31,770
 

2493
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,610
 awkward power dynamic at the macro level

2494
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:32,610
 

2495
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:34,530
 as well

2496
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,530
 

2497
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:36,870
 furthermore some of the folks who spoke

2498
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,870
 

2499
00:54:34,530 --> 00:54:38,310
 out kind of mentioned if someone gets a

2500
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:38,310
 

2501
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:40,260
 score wrong we need a process for

2502
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:40,260
 

2503
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:41,520
 understanding what that score means I'll

2504
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:41,520
 

2505
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:42,930
 give you a number from one to five we

2506
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:42,930
 

2507
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:45,119
 actually didn't tell you one was good

2508
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:45,119
 

2509
00:54:42,930 --> 00:54:46,619
 was bad but nonetheless we have to

2510
00:54:45,109 --> 00:54:46,619
 

2511
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:49,050
 figure out what that score means and

2512
00:54:46,609 --> 00:54:49,050
 

2513
00:54:46,619 --> 00:54:50,460
 like why did the person get that radiant

2514
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,460
 

2515
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:52,490
 and possibly try to create more of an

2516
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:52,490
 

2517
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:55,020
 appeals process or a dialogue around it

2518
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,020
 

2519
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:57,329
 even more so what's fair for the

2520
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:57,329
 

2521
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:58,559
 employer like the parents in this case

2522
00:54:57,319 --> 00:54:58,559
 

2523
00:54:57,329 --> 00:55:01,170
 might be different than what's fair for

2524
00:54:58,549 --> 00:55:01,170
 

2525
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:02,579
 the employee employers in this case the

2526
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:02,579
 

2527
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:05,069
 parents might want somebody who's like

2528
00:55:02,569 --> 00:55:05,069
 

2529
00:55:02,579 --> 00:55:06,900
 really really angel like to take care of

2530
00:55:05,059 --> 00:55:06,900
 

2531
00:55:05,069 --> 00:55:07,920
 their little darlings right but from the

2532
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:07,920
 

2533
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:09,869
 point of view of fairness for the

2534
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:09,869
 

2535
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:12,089
 individual it can be yeah maybe I posted

2536
00:55:09,859 --> 00:55:12,089
 

2537
00:55:09,869 --> 00:55:13,500
 some lyric online that somehow thinks I

2538
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:13,500
 

2539
00:55:12,089 --> 00:55:16,079
 use offensive language I'm aggressive

2540
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:16,079
 

2541
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:17,910
 now so this notion of like not only

2542
00:55:16,069 --> 00:55:17,910
 

2543
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:20,730
 transparent explain a rule to whom but

2544
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:20,730
 

2545
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:22,050
 also fear to who fear over what what are

2546
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,050
 

2547
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:23,339
 the attributes that are being brought in

2548
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,339
 

2549
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:25,500
 like the gentleman mention like maybe

2550
00:55:23,329 --> 00:55:25,500
 

2551
00:55:23,339 --> 00:55:28,440
 only five criteria fairness over what

2552
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:28,440
 

2553
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:29,910
 fairness so to whom these terms are

2554
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:29,910
 

2555
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:31,650
 missing all those operative words as

2556
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:31,650
 

2557
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:33,240
 well and these are by no means

2558
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,240
 

2559
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:35,369
 exhaustive right there are lots of

2560
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:35,369
 

2561
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:39,390
 different cases here so let's talk about

2562
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:39,390
 

2563
00:55:35,369 --> 00:55:41,550
 the next question this is suggestive in

2564
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:41,550
 

2565
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:43,800
 some way what would we need to make the

2566
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:43,800
 

2567
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:47,220
 system I guess sufficiently transparent

2568
00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:47,220
 

2569
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:50,510
 where that is determined up to you all

2570
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:50,510
 

2571
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:50,510
 for the next thirty Seconds to a minute

2572
00:57:06,769 --> 00:57:06,769
 

2573
00:57:06,779 --> 00:57:10,669
 I guess I didn't self-select to come to

2574
00:57:08,569 --> 00:57:10,669
 

2575
00:57:08,579 --> 00:57:10,669
 this

2576
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:18,570
 

2577
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:23,500
 all right let's let's come back together

2578
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:23,500
 

2579
00:57:20,590 --> 00:57:25,420
 and then if you have something you'd

2580
00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:25,420
 

2581
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:26,380
 like to share with with the whole room

2582
00:57:25,410 --> 00:57:26,380
 

2583
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:27,910
 please

2584
00:57:26,370 --> 00:57:27,910
 

2585
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:29,200
 come to one of the microphones either on

2586
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:29,200
 

2587
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:33,970
 the right side here on the left side

2588
00:57:29,190 --> 00:57:33,970
 

2589
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:35,440
 here in the center aisles and we can we

2590
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,440
 

2591
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:38,110
 can share some some thoughts about

2592
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:38,110
 

2593
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:47,110
 transparency in babysitter risk rating

2594
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:47,110
 

2595
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:48,580
 yes okay so in thinking about this

2596
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:48,580
 

2597
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:51,220
 question about what would make the

2598
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:51,220
 

2599
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:53,410
 system sufficiently transparent first I

2600
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:53,410
 

2601
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:55,030
 think if people know that if they're

2602
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,030
 

2603
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:57,190
 gonna rate someone that person will know

2604
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:57,190
 

2605
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:59,860
 who's rating them that might be

2606
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:59,860
 

2607
00:57:57,190 --> 00:58:01,960
 something to think about also having a

2608
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:01,960
 

2609
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:04,360
 diversity of recommenders or Raiders

2610
00:58:01,950 --> 00:58:04,360
 

2611
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:05,590
 because one parent could see something

2612
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:05,590
 

2613
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:07,270
 one way and another one could see

2614
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:07,270
 

2615
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:08,740
 something another way and not just

2616
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:08,740
 

2617
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:11,190
 putting out that first score that maybe

2618
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:11,190
 

2619
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:14,140
 the first parent gave in that whole

2620
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:14,140
 

2621
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:15,940
 recommendation pool I did like the

2622
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:15,940
 

2623
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:17,710
 appeals process I thought that was fair

2624
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:17,710
 

2625
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:19,240
 because I think if both parties know

2626
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:19,240
 

2627
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:22,000
 that that can happen then you're gonna

2628
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:22,000
 

2629
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:23,830
 probably think about what your real what

2630
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:23,830
 

2631
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,060
 your what the real situation was and

2632
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:25,060
 

2633
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:27,490
 whether if you want to be involved in

2634
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:27,490
 

2635
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:29,320
 that process and then also have a large

2636
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:29,320
 

2637
00:58:27,490 --> 00:58:31,630
 enough question pool because if you do

2638
00:58:29,310 --> 00:58:31,630
 

2639
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:33,430
 just have one question that that can

2640
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:33,430
 

2641
00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:36,490
 lean a lot of different ways so if you

2642
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:36,490
 

2643
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:38,050
 have maybe questions that involve the

2644
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,050
 

2645
00:58:36,490 --> 00:58:41,440
 activities that you did with the child

2646
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:41,440
 

2647
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:43,120
 or how you punish the child or if you

2648
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:43,120
 

2649
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,450
 work with them on homework that can

2650
00:58:43,110 --> 00:58:44,450
 

2651
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:46,880
 probably

2652
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:46,880
 

2653
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:50,930
 to the making the scores a little bit

2654
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:50,930
 

2655
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:54,079
 more transparent yeah I think that's

2656
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:54,079
 

2657
00:58:50,930 --> 00:58:56,450
 that those are all great points that

2658
00:58:54,069 --> 00:58:56,450
 

2659
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:58,940
 feed into sort of this question of

2660
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,940
 

2661
00:58:56,450 --> 00:59:01,700
 system dynamics and it's hard in a

2662
00:58:58,930 --> 00:59:01,700
 

2663
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:03,740
 system that's that's dynamic you know in

2664
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:03,740
 

2665
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:06,890
 a sort of media contacts to to figure

2666
00:59:03,730 --> 00:59:06,890
 

2667
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:08,320
 out what's going on in any particular

2668
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,320
 

2669
00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:11,359
 moment right maybe something you said

2670
00:59:08,310 --> 00:59:11,359
 

2671
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:13,280
 was in reaction to a joke or a meme

2672
00:59:11,349 --> 00:59:13,280
 

2673
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:19,130
 that's of that particular day or of that

2674
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:19,130
 

2675
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:21,710
 particular hour and just for my own

2676
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:21,710
 

2677
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:25,579
 curiosity how many people still make

2678
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:25,579
 

2679
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:28,369
 jokes about cope FA anyone no that's

2680
00:59:25,569 --> 00:59:28,369
 

2681
00:59:25,579 --> 00:59:32,440
 that's going to be B out of context and

2682
00:59:28,359 --> 00:59:32,440
 

2683
00:59:28,369 --> 00:59:32,440
 so that that context is important yes

2684
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:34,920
 

2685
00:59:34,930 --> 00:59:42,109
 sorry I think this is sufficiently

2686
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:42,109
 

2687
00:59:38,570 --> 00:59:44,480
 transparent because the nature of taking

2688
00:59:42,099 --> 00:59:44,480
 

2689
00:59:42,109 --> 00:59:47,450
 data from social media is slightly

2690
00:59:44,470 --> 00:59:47,450
 

2691
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:50,089
 coercive so if you're then sharing data

2692
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,089
 

2693
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:52,940
 that you force someone to give that they

2694
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:52,940
 

2695
00:59:50,089 --> 00:59:55,940
 normally view as more private and you're

2696
00:59:52,930 --> 00:59:55,940
 

2697
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:58,619
 starting to explain over that data to

2698
00:59:55,930 --> 00:59:58,619
 

2699
00:59:55,940 --> 01:00:02,430
 people who aren't even that

2700
00:59:58,609 --> 01:00:02,430
 

2701
00:59:58,619 --> 01:00:03,930
 you can create a lot of problems yeah I

2702
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:03,930
 

2703
01:00:02,430 --> 01:00:06,300
 think I think that's a great point that

2704
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,300
 

2705
01:00:03,930 --> 01:00:07,740
 if if we're not using data that's

2706
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:07,740
 

2707
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:09,089
 relevant to the problem that we're

2708
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:09,089
 

2709
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:11,190
 actually trying to solve it might in

2710
01:00:09,079 --> 01:00:11,190
 

2711
01:00:09,089 --> 01:00:12,180
 fact be impossible to be sufficiently

2712
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:12,180
 

2713
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:14,940
 transparent about what we're doing

2714
01:00:12,170 --> 01:00:14,940
 

2715
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:17,430
 because once we've made ourselves that

2716
01:00:14,930 --> 01:00:17,430
 

2717
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:19,140
 transparent it becomes clear that the

2718
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:19,140
 

2719
01:00:17,430 --> 01:00:22,260
 answers that we've come up with don't

2720
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:22,260
 

2721
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:24,690
 don't have the meaning we would want

2722
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:24,690
 

2723
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:26,880
 them to so just some stuff that men and

2724
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:26,880
 

2725
01:00:24,690 --> 01:00:29,700
 I had talked about before the session

2726
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:29,700
 

2727
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:32,099
 about transparency here one is is

2728
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:32,099
 

2729
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:35,849
 reproducibility of sports right can you

2730
01:00:32,089 --> 01:00:35,849
 

2731
01:00:32,099 --> 01:00:38,220
 actually not just explain how a score

2732
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:38,220
 

2733
01:00:35,849 --> 01:00:41,820
 was achieved but demonstrate how to

2734
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:41,820
 

2735
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:43,589
 calculate that score you know figure out

2736
01:00:41,810 --> 01:00:43,589
 

2737
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:45,960
 what features should go into that score

2738
01:00:43,579 --> 01:00:45,960
 

2739
01:00:43,589 --> 01:00:48,660
 and and that leads us down as a

2740
01:00:45,950 --> 01:00:48,660
 

2741
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:50,640
 different rabbit hole of causality that

2742
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:50,640
 

2743
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:53,460
 I don't I don't really want to go down

2744
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:53,460
 

2745
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:55,859
 too far but we do want to know that the

2746
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:55,859
 

2747
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:58,830
 mechanisms that we've captured a sort of

2748
01:00:55,849 --> 01:00:58,830
 

2749
01:00:55,859 --> 01:01:01,140
 meaningful there's a privacy aspect to

2750
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:01,140
 

2751
01:00:58,830 --> 01:01:03,349
 transparency right so people are opting

2752
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:03,349
 

2753
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:06,210
 in to giving their data to this system

2754
01:01:03,339 --> 01:01:06,210
 

2755
01:01:03,349 --> 01:01:08,070
 do they have control over what goes into

2756
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,070
 

2757
01:01:06,210 --> 01:01:10,080
 the data or not is this all your posts

2758
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:10,080
 

2759
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:12,230
 are these just your public posts are

2760
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:12,230
 

2761
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:15,540
 these just posts that you've shared with

2762
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:15,540
 

2763
01:01:12,230 --> 01:01:17,670
 with the system that you've curated to

2764
01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:17,670
 

2765
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:19,290
 be representative of you in some way so

2766
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:19,290
 

2767
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:22,740
 having an understanding of that I think

2768
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:22,740
 

2769
01:01:19,290 --> 01:01:24,900
 is is also interesting and then I sort

2770
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:24,900
 

2771
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:27,930
 of set an explanation aside but I do

2772
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:27,930
 

2773
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:29,369
 want to bring it back because if we want

2774
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,369
 

2775
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:32,280
 people to understand what's going on in

2776
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:32,280
 

2777
01:01:29,369 --> 01:01:33,720
 the system I think it's very much the

2778
01:01:32,270 --> 01:01:33,720
 

2779
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:35,580
 case that we'd like to be able to

2780
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:35,580
 

2781
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:38,040
 explain to them how their score was

2782
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:38,040
 

2783
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:43,170
 calculated so you were a for instead of

2784
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:43,170
 

2785
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:48,089
 a five because you should have had you

2786
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:48,089
 

2787
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:54,119
 know more better or fewer rap lyrics on

2788
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:54,119
 

2789
01:01:48,089 --> 01:01:58,819
 your Twitter feed so that explained

2790
01:01:54,109 --> 01:01:58,819
 

2791
01:01:54,119 --> 01:02:00,739
 ability point brings me to two

2792
01:01:58,809 --> 01:02:00,739
 

2793
01:01:58,819 --> 01:02:02,299
 our penultimate question in this segment

2794
01:02:00,729 --> 01:02:02,299
 

2795
01:02:00,739 --> 01:02:04,939
 which I'll give you about 30 seconds to

2796
01:02:02,289 --> 01:02:04,939
 

2797
01:02:02,299 --> 01:02:07,549
 talk about which is do the concerns that

2798
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:07,549
 

2799
01:02:04,939 --> 01:02:10,869
 we talked about do they go away if we

2800
01:02:07,539 --> 01:02:10,869
 

2801
01:02:07,549 --> 01:02:13,789
 find a way to give those explanations or

2802
01:02:10,859 --> 01:02:13,789
 

2803
01:02:10,869 --> 01:02:16,130
 to what extent do they go away I guess

2804
01:02:13,779 --> 01:02:16,130
 

2805
01:02:13,789 --> 01:02:17,779
 we might ask so go ahead and take 30

2806
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:17,779
 

2807
01:02:16,130 --> 01:02:20,019
 seconds with your neighbor to talk about

2808
01:02:17,769 --> 01:02:20,019
 

2809
01:02:17,779 --> 01:02:20,019
 that

2810
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:26,050
 

2811
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:32,230
 we're at the two more 32nd things I'm so

2812
01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:32,230
 

2813
01:02:29,849 --> 01:02:35,499
 like my father

2814
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:35,499
 

2815
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:35,499
[Music]

2816
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:36,740
 

2817
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:46,860
 which have one more case study yeah and

2818
01:02:44,070 --> 01:02:46,860
 

2819
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:46,860
 then do questions

2820
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:50,280
 

2821
01:02:50,290 --> 01:02:53,460
 about 30 seconds

2822
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:12,380
 

2823
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:19,380
 all right let's talk about explain

2824
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:19,380
 

2825
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:20,940
 ability so what do you all think if we

2826
01:03:19,370 --> 01:03:20,940
 

2827
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:27,779
 were to try to explain outputs would

2828
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:27,779
 

2829
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:31,680
 this kind of alleviate concerns take a

2830
01:03:27,769 --> 01:03:31,680
 

2831
01:03:27,779 --> 01:03:34,490
 boat I see somebody's coming up but yeah

2832
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:34,490
 

2833
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:34,490
 you could speak as well too

2834
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:00,870
 

2835
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:06,200
 yeah

2836
01:04:03,030 --> 01:04:06,200
 

2837
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:09,440
 we repeated for that so the point was

2838
01:04:06,190 --> 01:04:09,440
 

2839
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:11,960
 that it it depends a lot on context is

2840
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:11,960
 

2841
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:14,330
 how I take it and sometimes there's a

2842
01:04:11,950 --> 01:04:14,330
 

2843
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:16,630
 context where if there's a particularly

2844
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:16,630
 

2845
01:04:14,330 --> 01:04:18,590
 problematic child for example maybe

2846
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:18,590
 

2847
01:04:16,630 --> 01:04:22,460
 babysitter's don't interact with that

2848
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:22,460
 

2849
01:04:18,590 --> 01:04:24,650
 child in in the same way and I think

2850
01:04:22,450 --> 01:04:24,650
 

2851
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:27,560
 that sort of generalizes a little bit

2852
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:27,560
 

2853
01:04:24,650 --> 01:04:34,220
 too to the social media setting to say

2854
01:04:27,550 --> 01:04:34,220
 

2855
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:35,870
 that people may treat others on social

2856
01:04:34,210 --> 01:04:35,870
 

2857
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:38,000
 media to sort of meet the environment

2858
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:38,000
 

2859
01:04:35,870 --> 01:04:42,710
 differently based on who they are so for

2860
01:04:37,990 --> 01:04:42,710
 

2861
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:44,090
 example my Twitter responses to Nitin

2862
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:44,090
 

2863
01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:49,220
 might be very different from my Twitter

2864
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:49,220
 

2865
01:04:44,090 --> 01:04:50,270
 responses to at real Donald Trump there

2866
01:04:49,210 --> 01:04:50,270
 

2867
01:04:49,220 --> 01:05:00,680
 was another gentleman who was making as

2868
01:04:50,260 --> 01:05:00,680
 

2869
01:04:50,270 --> 01:05:02,390
 we have some like so for example it

2870
01:05:00,670 --> 01:05:02,390
 

2871
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:05,390
 wouldn't be solved by explaining the

2872
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:05,390
 

2873
01:05:02,390 --> 01:05:07,960
 outputs if you have any explanations

2874
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:07,960
 

2875
01:05:05,390 --> 01:05:11,330
 that are relating to say fried and graph

2876
01:05:07,950 --> 01:05:11,330
 

2877
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:14,600
 because they are your explanations are

2878
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:14,600
 

2879
01:05:11,330 --> 01:05:17,390
 helping users of the system perpetuate

2880
01:05:14,590 --> 01:05:17,390
 

2881
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:20,030
 their own biases so for example if

2882
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:20,030
 

2883
01:05:17,390 --> 01:05:23,620
 someone goes to an inner-city school you

2884
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:23,620
 

2885
01:05:20,030 --> 01:05:23,620
 look at their friend graph and Mike

2886
01:05:23,770 --> 01:05:23,770
 

2887
01:05:23,780 --> 01:05:30,500
 babysitting score from an ml perspective

2888
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:30,500
 

2889
01:05:27,350 --> 01:05:32,330
 it may well be a good predictor but you

2890
01:05:30,490 --> 01:05:32,330
 

2891
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:33,830
 aren't actually analyzing the person

2892
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:33,830
 

2893
01:05:32,330 --> 01:05:36,710
 we're analyzing their network of

2894
01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:36,710
 

2895
01:05:33,830 --> 01:05:40,070
 friendships so it's a highly biased and

2896
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:40,070
 

2897
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:42,680
 highly problematic instance but as a

2898
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:42,680
 

2899
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:46,040
 parent if you read this person has a lot

2900
01:05:42,670 --> 01:05:46,040
 

2901
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:48,860
 of friends who use drugs that's probably

2902
01:05:46,030 --> 01:05:48,860
 

2903
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:50,990
 enough to not hire a babysitter even

2904
01:05:48,850 --> 01:05:50,990
 

2905
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:53,210
 though it's not directly on the person

2906
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:53,210
 

2907
01:05:50,990 --> 01:05:55,420
 so they are you're creating a lot of

2908
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,420
 

2909
01:05:53,210 --> 01:05:55,420
 bias

2910
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:55,660
 

2911
01:05:55,670 --> 01:06:02,180
 yeah so just I apologize your voice is

2912
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:02,180
 

2913
01:05:59,450 --> 01:06:05,150
 very has a very similar register to the

2914
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:05,150
 

2915
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:07,010
 air handling so it's a little bit

2916
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:07,010
 

2917
01:06:05,150 --> 01:06:13,130
 challenging to hear but as I understood

2918
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:13,130
 

2919
01:06:07,010 --> 01:06:14,840
 the point it was that the context of

2920
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:14,840
 

2921
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:17,600
 people's features might change as well

2922
01:06:14,830 --> 01:06:17,600
 

2923
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:20,270
 so if I explained to you that your

2924
01:06:17,590 --> 01:06:20,270
 

2925
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:22,460
 decision was poor because of some fact

2926
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:22,460
 

2927
01:06:20,270 --> 01:06:24,970
 about your use of language that might be

2928
01:06:22,450 --> 01:06:24,970
 

2929
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:28,130
 due to the fact that your friend graph

2930
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:28,130
 

2931
01:06:24,970 --> 01:06:29,810
 places you in a context where your use

2932
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:29,810
 

2933
01:06:28,130 --> 01:06:32,720
 of language is different from maybe what

2934
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:32,720
 

2935
01:06:29,810 --> 01:06:35,720
 the model was expecting that actually

2936
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:35,720
 

2937
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:37,490
 reminds me of a very cool result from

2938
01:06:35,710 --> 01:06:37,490
 

2939
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:39,050
 Siouxland Blodgett and one of her grad

2940
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:39,050
 

2941
01:06:37,490 --> 01:06:40,670
 students I think she's at Dartmouth but

2942
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:40,670
 

2943
01:06:39,050 --> 01:06:41,750
 I'm sure that's wrong and someone will

2944
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:41,750
 

2945
01:06:40,670 --> 01:06:44,770
 come and actually tell me it was the

2946
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:44,770
 

2947
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:51,260
 University of New Hampshire the

2948
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:51,260
 

2949
01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:55,160
 somewhere in that part of the US that if

2950
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:55,160
 

2951
01:06:51,260 --> 01:06:57,680
 we take social media posts in African

2952
01:06:55,150 --> 01:06:57,680
 

2953
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:59,960
 American vernacular English and we feed

2954
01:06:57,670 --> 01:06:59,960
 

2955
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:02,300
 them into sort of standard and I'll P

2956
01:06:59,950 --> 01:07:02,300
 

2957
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:04,310
 language detection models it turns out

2958
01:07:02,290 --> 01:07:04,310
 

2959
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:09,680
 that many of those posts are in Danish

2960
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:09,680
 

2961
01:07:04,310 --> 01:07:11,030
 what new other things that Josh and I

2962
01:07:09,670 --> 01:07:11,030
 

2963
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:12,680
 thought about for this question right

2964
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:12,680
 

2965
01:07:11,030 --> 01:07:14,720
 our concerns with the system solved by

2966
01:07:12,670 --> 01:07:14,720
 

2967
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:16,940
 explaining the outputs we thought that

2968
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:16,940
 

2969
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:18,710
 well if the extent of the explanation

2970
01:07:16,930 --> 01:07:18,710
 

2971
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:20,690
 was just described at how the score was

2972
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:20,690
 

2973
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:22,160
 competed then probably not

2974
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:22,160
 

2975
01:07:20,690 --> 01:07:23,450
 all right that's that's not actually

2976
01:07:22,150 --> 01:07:23,450
 

2977
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:25,700
 solving the concerns we raised about

2978
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:25,700
 

2979
01:07:23,450 --> 01:07:27,680
 fairness and transparency but what if

2980
01:07:25,690 --> 01:07:27,680
 

2981
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:29,570
 instead the form of explanations takes

2982
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:29,570
 

2983
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:31,310
 this instead right so instead of

2984
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:31,310
 

2985
01:07:29,570 --> 01:07:33,110
 actually just saying like how the score

2986
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:33,110
 

2987
01:07:31,310 --> 01:07:35,120
 was computed what if we actually give

2988
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:35,120
 

2989
01:07:33,110 --> 01:07:36,410
 like a subset of hosts that say these

2990
01:07:35,110 --> 01:07:36,410
 

2991
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:38,300
 were things that the model flag was

2992
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,300
 

2993
01:07:36,410 --> 01:07:39,980
 problematic to create a dialogue between

2994
01:07:38,290 --> 01:07:39,980
 

2995
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:42,170
 the potential employer and the potential

2996
01:07:39,970 --> 01:07:42,170
 

2997
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:43,790
 employee that has a very different use

2998
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:43,790
 

2999
01:07:42,170 --> 01:07:47,330
 of what the explanation is used for in

3000
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:47,330
 

3001
01:07:43,790 --> 01:07:49,580
 that case so even more so right if the

3002
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:49,580
 

3003
01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:51,230
 tool were to just rate people in such a

3004
01:07:49,570 --> 01:07:51,230
 

3005
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:52,940
 way that it's either hired or not right

3006
01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:52,940
 

3007
01:07:51,230 --> 01:07:55,070
 there was no human-in-the-loop that

3008
01:07:52,930 --> 01:07:55,070
 

3009
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:56,900
 would also be problematic but once again

3010
01:07:55,060 --> 01:07:56,900
 

3011
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:59,840
 right if you actually use this to

3012
01:07:56,890 --> 01:07:59,840
 

3013
01:07:56,900 --> 01:08:01,100
 facilitate conversation and realize that

3014
01:07:59,830 --> 01:08:01,100
 

3015
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:02,950
 well maybe I can use these explanations

3016
01:08:01,090 --> 01:08:02,950
 

3017
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:05,330
 to open a dialog and create a process

3018
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:05,330
 

3019
01:08:02,950 --> 01:08:06,470
 then it might seem like explanations can

3020
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:06,470
 

3021
01:08:05,330 --> 01:08:08,510
 be valuable here

3022
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:08,510
 

3023
01:08:06,470 --> 01:08:09,710
 and I think I kind of stole the last

3024
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:09,710
 

3025
01:08:08,510 --> 01:08:12,319
 talking point for one of them of

3026
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:12,319
 

3027
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:13,940
 possible solutions but nonetheless right

3028
01:08:12,309 --> 01:08:13,940
 

3029
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:16,069
 so instead of just giving a score why

3030
01:08:13,930 --> 01:08:16,069
 

3031
01:08:13,940 --> 01:08:17,750
 not give people a potential list of

3032
01:08:16,059 --> 01:08:17,750
 

3033
01:08:16,069 --> 01:08:19,339
 posts that are of concern we know from

3034
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:19,339
 

3035
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:21,410
 Miller's work that explanations are

3036
01:08:19,329 --> 01:08:21,410
 

3037
01:08:19,339 --> 01:08:22,580
 selective I can find a subset of things

3038
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:22,580
 

3039
01:08:21,410 --> 01:08:24,259
 that where the model thought were

3040
01:08:22,570 --> 01:08:24,259
 

3041
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:26,270
 concerns kind of as a diagnostic tool in

3042
01:08:24,249 --> 01:08:26,270
 

3043
01:08:24,259 --> 01:08:27,589
 some way as opposed to blindly just

3044
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:27,589
 

3045
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:29,330
 trying to predict like if somebody

3046
01:08:27,579 --> 01:08:29,330
 

3047
01:08:27,589 --> 01:08:30,799
 should be hired immediately or not to

3048
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:30,799
 

3049
01:08:29,330 --> 01:08:35,930
 create this dialogue to start that

3050
01:08:30,789 --> 01:08:35,930
 

3051
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:45,500
 process I'm gonna actually say we should

3052
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:45,500
 

3053
01:08:35,930 --> 01:08:47,239
 play a break in oh yeah even more so so

3054
01:08:45,490 --> 01:08:47,239
 

3055
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:49,219
 I think that's an excellent question the

3056
01:08:47,229 --> 01:08:49,219
 

3057
01:08:47,239 --> 01:08:51,350
 question was how would you handle the

3058
01:08:49,209 --> 01:08:51,350
 

3059
01:08:49,219 --> 01:08:53,029
 context bias question with this approach

3060
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:53,029
 

3061
01:08:51,350 --> 01:08:57,230
 of giving a subset of posts as opposed

3062
01:08:53,019 --> 01:08:57,230
 

3063
01:08:53,029 --> 01:08:58,219
 to just a score I I think I would answer

3064
01:08:57,220 --> 01:08:58,219
 

3065
01:08:57,230 --> 01:09:00,650
 that question with another question

3066
01:08:58,209 --> 01:09:00,650
 

3067
01:08:58,219 --> 01:09:03,710
 which is I don't know the extent to

3068
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:03,710
 

3069
01:09:00,650 --> 01:09:05,089
 which the kana it's very possible that a

3070
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:05,089
 

3071
01:09:03,710 --> 01:09:07,250
 large portion of the contacts bias

3072
01:09:05,079 --> 01:09:07,250
 

3073
01:09:05,089 --> 01:09:08,779
 question is captured by the context of

3074
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:08,779
 

3075
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:10,400
 hiring right so maybe it's the case that

3076
01:09:08,769 --> 01:09:10,400
 

3077
01:09:08,779 --> 01:09:12,650
 the places you're likely to be hired as

3078
01:09:10,390 --> 01:09:12,650
 

3079
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:14,540
 a babysitter are similar enough to your

3080
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:14,540
 

3081
01:09:12,650 --> 01:09:19,790
 friend graph are similar enough to that

3082
01:09:14,530 --> 01:09:19,790
 

3083
01:09:14,540 --> 01:09:21,949
 context that you can take the the posts

3084
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:21,949
 

3085
01:09:19,790 --> 01:09:23,989
 out of that and present them to an

3086
01:09:21,939 --> 01:09:23,989
 

3087
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:26,870
 employer in a similar enough context

3088
01:09:23,979 --> 01:09:26,870
 

3089
01:09:23,989 --> 01:09:28,310
 that they they still function in a

3090
01:09:26,860 --> 01:09:28,310
 

3091
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:31,520
 useful way I don't know that that's the

3092
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:31,520
 

3093
01:09:28,310 --> 01:09:32,989
 case I just hypothesized that it might

3094
01:09:31,510 --> 01:09:32,989
 

3095
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:37,279
 be and that's something that we can we

3096
01:09:32,979 --> 01:09:37,279
 

3097
01:09:32,989 --> 01:09:38,540
 can measure and wrap up that yeah so

3098
01:09:37,269 --> 01:09:38,540
 

3099
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:40,790
 before we're gonna take a little bit of

3100
01:09:38,530 --> 01:09:40,790
 

3101
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:42,350
 a break but before I get there this

3102
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:42,350
 

3103
01:09:40,790 --> 01:09:44,810
 actually wasn't a hypothetical case that

3104
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:44,810
 

3105
01:09:42,350 --> 01:09:46,609
 we made up this we pulled from actually

3106
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,609
 

3107
01:09:44,810 --> 01:09:48,410
 a Washington Post article in which the

3108
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:48,410
 

3109
01:09:46,609 --> 01:09:50,299
 headline was wanted the perfect baby

3110
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:50,299
 

3111
01:09:48,410 --> 01:09:52,580
 sitter you must pass an AI scan for

3112
01:09:50,289 --> 01:09:52,580
 

3113
01:09:50,299 --> 01:09:53,810
 respect and attitude so this was

3114
01:09:52,570 --> 01:09:53,810
 

3115
01:09:52,580 --> 01:09:55,910
 actually a real case it wasn't a

3116
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:55,910
 

3117
01:09:53,810 --> 01:09:57,410
 hypothetical we just made X Corp up and

3118
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:57,410
 

3119
01:09:55,910 --> 01:09:58,670
 said well yeah if you want to read more

3120
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:58,670
 

3121
01:09:57,410 --> 01:09:59,840
 about it the link is there on the

3122
01:09:58,660 --> 01:09:59,840
 

3123
01:09:58,670 --> 01:10:03,380
 Washington Post it's kind of a

3124
01:09:59,830 --> 01:10:03,380
 

3125
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:05,570
 fascinating article I should add to the

3126
01:10:03,370 --> 01:10:05,570
 

3127
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:07,910
 the other non hypothetical version of

3128
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:07,910
 

3129
01:10:05,570 --> 01:10:09,680
 this is that immigrations and Customs

3130
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:09,680
 

3131
01:10:07,910 --> 01:10:11,600
 Enforcement in the United States wrote a

3132
01:10:09,670 --> 01:10:11,600
 

3133
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:13,100
 procurement document last summer in

3134
01:10:11,590 --> 01:10:13,100
 

3135
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:15,260
 which they said they wanted to evaluate

3136
01:10:13,090 --> 01:10:15,260
 

3137
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:17,780
 people based on their social media data

3138
01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:17,780
 

3139
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:20,960
 for their propensity to come

3140
01:10:17,770 --> 01:10:20,960
 

3141
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:22,099
 crimes or terrorist acts or - but the

3142
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:22,099
 

3143
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:23,360
 procurement document said was be a

3144
01:10:22,089 --> 01:10:23,360
 

3145
01:10:22,099 --> 01:10:25,400
 positively contributing member of

3146
01:10:23,350 --> 01:10:25,400
 

3147
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:27,020
 society I don't know how to write a loss

3148
01:10:25,390 --> 01:10:27,020
 

3149
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:31,039
 function for that if you do please see

3150
01:10:27,010 --> 01:10:31,039
 

3151
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:32,389
 me at the break which is now yes so

3152
01:10:31,029 --> 01:10:32,389
 

3153
01:10:31,039 --> 01:10:37,670

3223
01:22:19,099 --> 01:22:23,000
 or so and then we'll have questions

3225
01:22:20,780 --> 01:22:24,980

3231
01:22:27,050 --> 01:22:31,520
 please don't leave and start being noisy

3232
01:22:29,830 --> 01:22:31,520
 

3233
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:33,320
 if you're not interested in staying for

3234
01:22:31,510 --> 01:22:33,320
 

3235
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:34,520
 the questions stay if you can if you do

3236
01:22:33,310 --> 01:22:34,520
 

3237
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:36,170
 feel you need to leave them please try

3238
01:22:34,510 --> 01:22:36,170
 

3239
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:37,340
 to leave quietly and move away before

3240
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:37,340
 

3241
01:22:36,170 --> 01:22:44,630
 starting to talk outside

3242
01:22:37,330 --> 01:22:44,630
 

3243
01:22:37,340 --> 01:22:46,909
 thanks very much great so welcome back

3244
01:22:44,620 --> 01:22:46,909
 

3245
01:22:44,630 --> 01:22:48,260
 so we're gonna think of a separate case

3246
01:22:46,899 --> 01:22:48,260
 

3247
01:22:46,909 --> 01:22:50,000
 here in this case is going to be

3248
01:22:48,250 --> 01:22:50,000
 

3249
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:52,489
 actually about law enforcement facial

3250
01:22:49,990 --> 01:22:52,489
 

3251
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:55,400
 recognition so moving away from the

3252
01:22:52,479 --> 01:22:55,400
 

3253
01:22:52,489 --> 01:22:57,320
 babysitter AI from before so on this one

3254
01:22:55,390 --> 01:22:57,320
 

3255
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:59,210
 here's a scenario there's a police

3256
01:22:57,310 --> 01:22:59,210
 

3257
01:22:57,320 --> 01:23:00,650
 department in the city of whyville and

3258
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,650
 

3259
01:22:59,210 --> 01:23:02,480
 they want to be able to identify

3260
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:02,480
 

3261
01:23:00,650 --> 01:23:04,610
 criminal suspects in crime scenes videos

3262
01:23:02,470 --> 01:23:04,610
 

3263
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:06,349
 to know if the suspect is either known

3264
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:06,349
 

3265
01:23:04,610 --> 01:23:09,800
 to detective or or has been arrested

3266
01:23:06,339 --> 01:23:09,800
 

3267
01:23:06,349 --> 01:23:11,989
 before so a company called Z Corp offers

3268
01:23:09,790 --> 01:23:11,989
 

3269
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:13,880
 the cloud facial recognition API and

3270
01:23:11,979 --> 01:23:13,880
 

3271
01:23:11,989 --> 01:23:15,409
 what the police are gonna do is we're

3272
01:23:13,870 --> 01:23:15,409
 

3273
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:17,480
 gonna build a system that uses this API

3274
01:23:15,399 --> 01:23:17,480
 

3275
01:23:15,409 --> 01:23:20,000
 so query probe frames from the crime

3276
01:23:17,470 --> 01:23:20,000
 

3277
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:21,889
 scene video against the rival police

3278
01:23:19,990 --> 01:23:21,889
 

3279
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:25,540
 mugshot database to see if they

3280
01:23:21,879 --> 01:23:25,540
 

3281
01:23:21,889 --> 01:23:25,540
 recognize the individual from the video

3282
01:23:25,709 --> 01:23:25,709
 

3283
01:23:25,719 --> 01:23:29,270
 so yeah we're gonna have kind of a

3284
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:29,270
 

3285
01:23:27,770 --> 01:23:30,949
 similar dynamic as before we're gonna

3286
01:23:29,260 --> 01:23:30,949
 

3287
01:23:29,270 --> 01:23:32,690
 pose some questions let you all make

3288
01:23:30,939 --> 01:23:32,690
 

3289
01:23:30,949 --> 01:23:34,849
 friends and talk about it then bring it

3290
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:34,849
 

3291
01:23:32,690 --> 01:23:36,110
 back together so I'll go back to the

3292
01:23:34,839 --> 01:23:36,110
 

3293
01:23:34,849 --> 01:23:40,460
 previous one in a second or if you want

3294
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:40,460
 

3295
01:23:36,110 --> 01:23:43,969
 to take a picture here it is but I'll go

3296
01:23:40,450 --> 01:23:43,969
 

3297
01:23:40,460 --> 01:23:45,230
 back in a second but the idea was like

3298
01:23:43,959 --> 01:23:45,230
 

3299
01:23:43,969 --> 01:23:47,270
 the fact that this is a government

3300
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:47,270
 

3301
01:23:45,230 --> 01:23:48,619
 application how does it change anything

3302
01:23:47,260 --> 01:23:48,619
 

3303
01:23:47,270 --> 01:23:53,540
 about the requirements from the first

3304
01:23:48,609 --> 01:23:53,540
 

3305
01:23:48,619 --> 01:23:55,590
 case if at all these are a tough

3306
01:23:53,530 --> 01:23:55,590
 

3307
01:23:53,540 --> 01:23:59,930
 questions

3308
01:23:55,580 --> 01:23:59,930
 

3309
01:23:55,590 --> 01:23:59,930
 make a friend have some fun

3310
01:24:05,450 --> 01:24:05,450
 

3311
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:08,750
 you should talk about this one

3312
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:23,680
 

3313
01:24:23,690 --> 01:24:28,640
 one of the guys he was a professor at

3314
01:24:25,690 --> 01:24:28,640
 

3315
01:24:25,700 --> 01:24:31,490

3316
01:24:28,630 --> 01:24:31,490

3321
01:24:33,830 --> 01:24:38,630

3322
01:24:35,140 --> 01:24:38,630
 

3323
01:24:35,150 --> 01:24:41,200
 fantasy here I think I was in industry

3324
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:41,200
 

3325
01:24:38,630 --> 01:24:41,200
 making Bank

3326
01:25:59,740 --> 01:25:59,740
 

3327
01:25:59,750 --> 01:26:03,560
 all right I see a lot of good discussion

3328
01:26:01,630 --> 01:26:03,560
 

3329
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:05,090
 out there I hate to break it up but if

3330
01:26:03,550 --> 01:26:05,090
 

3331
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:07,220
 we could kind of come back to order if

3332
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:07,220
 

3333
01:26:05,090 --> 01:26:11,480
 you have thoughts on this question

3334
01:26:07,210 --> 01:26:11,480
 

3335
01:26:07,220 --> 01:26:17,000
 please use the the Mike's question is is

3336
01:26:11,470 --> 01:26:17,000
 

3337
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:19,310
 there a difference between the previous

3338
01:26:16,990 --> 01:26:19,310
 

3339
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:21,260
 case where the application was a private

3340
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:21,260
 

3341
01:26:19,310 --> 01:26:24,260
 company selling a service to consumers

3342
01:26:21,250 --> 01:26:24,260
 

3343
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:27,050
 in this case where the service is being

3344
01:26:24,250 --> 01:26:27,050
 

3345
01:26:24,260 --> 01:26:29,090
 deployed by a government agency so

3346
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:29,090
 

3347
01:26:27,050 --> 01:26:31,790
 anybody have any thoughts on whether

3348
01:26:29,080 --> 01:26:31,790
 

3349
01:26:29,090 --> 01:26:43,070
 that changes the fairness transparency

3350
01:26:31,780 --> 01:26:43,070
 

3351
01:26:31,790 --> 01:26:45,080
 accountability requirements yes no okay

3352
01:26:43,060 --> 01:26:45,080
 

3353
01:26:43,070 --> 01:26:47,630
 so I think when it comes to a government

3354
01:26:45,070 --> 01:26:47,630
 

3355
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:49,700
 application there's obvious compliance

3356
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:49,700
 

3357
01:26:47,630 --> 01:26:51,230
 with some of the legal requirements as

3358
01:26:49,690 --> 01:26:51,230
 

3359
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:54,040
 an example in the u.s. it would be the

3360
01:26:51,220 --> 01:26:54,040
 

3361
01:26:51,230 --> 01:26:56,450
 Freedom of Information Act so

3362
01:26:54,030 --> 01:26:56,450
 

3363
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:59,150
 maintaining the records in a manner in

3364
01:26:56,440 --> 01:26:59,150
 

3365
01:26:56,450 --> 01:27:02,390
 which you can fulfill those requests if

3366
01:26:59,140 --> 01:27:02,390
 

3367
01:26:59,150 --> 01:27:04,310
 they come in you know maintaining

3368
01:27:02,380 --> 01:27:04,310
 

3369
01:27:02,390 --> 01:27:05,990
 privacy and complying with all of the

3370
01:27:04,300 --> 01:27:05,990
 

3371
01:27:04,310 --> 01:27:08,420
 other sort of regulator and regulatory

3372
01:27:05,980 --> 01:27:08,420
 

3373
01:27:05,990 --> 01:27:12,080
 pieces it is something that would differ

3374
01:27:08,410 --> 01:27:12,080
 

3375
01:27:08,420 --> 01:27:13,700
 when it comes to a common contacts yeah

3376
01:27:12,070 --> 01:27:13,700
 

3377
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:15,530
 so that's that's definitely one

3378
01:27:13,690 --> 01:27:15,530
 

3379
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:18,610
 important point that government agencies

3380
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:18,610
 

3381
01:27:15,530 --> 01:27:22,280
 are often subject to much stronger

3382
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:22,280
 

3383
01:27:18,610 --> 01:27:24,800
 regulatory requirements and there's one

3384
01:27:22,270 --> 01:27:24,800
 

3385
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:26,660
 other comment here yes I'm gonna say

3386
01:27:24,790 --> 01:27:26,660
 

3387
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:28,580
 just just a counter counterpoint to that

3388
01:27:26,650 --> 01:27:28,580
 

3389
01:27:26,660 --> 01:27:29,900
 there's also such laws like the Patriot

3390
01:27:28,570 --> 01:27:29,900
 

3391
01:27:28,580 --> 01:27:33,500
 Act which basically prevent that

3392
01:27:29,890 --> 01:27:33,500
 

3393
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:35,300
 information from being transparent so I

3394
01:27:33,490 --> 01:27:35,300
 

3395
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:37,460
 mean in the sense that if it is a

3396
01:27:35,290 --> 01:27:37,460
 

3397
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:38,990
 government application and depending in

3398
01:27:37,450 --> 01:27:38,990
 

3399
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:40,460
 this case it's being used for security

3400
01:27:38,980 --> 01:27:40,460
 

3401
01:27:38,990 --> 01:27:42,170
 purposes you have the inherent

3402
01:27:40,450 --> 01:27:42,170
 

3403
01:27:40,460 --> 01:27:44,150
 disconnect between the government who

3404
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:44,150
 

3405
01:27:42,170 --> 01:27:46,540
 and does not want to explain or have

3406
01:27:44,140 --> 01:27:46,540
 

3407
01:27:44,150 --> 01:27:48,500
 anything transparent versus the actual

3408
01:27:46,530 --> 01:27:48,500
 

3409
01:27:46,540 --> 01:27:50,030
 end-users in this case that are being

3410
01:27:48,490 --> 01:27:50,030
 

3411
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:53,090
 affected by it that would like that

3412
01:27:50,020 --> 01:27:53,090
 

3413
01:27:50,030 --> 01:27:55,820
 transparency yeah I think that's that's

3414
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:55,820
 

3415
01:27:53,090 --> 01:27:57,800
 an important point that not only do

3416
01:27:55,810 --> 01:27:57,800
 

3417
01:27:55,820 --> 01:28:00,350
 government agencies have higher

3418
01:27:57,790 --> 01:28:00,350
 

3419
01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:02,210
 regulatory burdens in many cases but we

3420
01:28:00,340 --> 01:28:02,210
 

3421
01:28:00,350 --> 01:28:03,770
 shouldn't believe that by satisfying

3422
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:03,770
 

3423
01:28:02,210 --> 01:28:06,590
 those high regulatory burdens we've

3424
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:06,590
 

3425
01:28:03,770 --> 01:28:09,090
 somehow made these problems go away and

3426
01:28:06,580 --> 01:28:09,090
 

3427
01:28:06,590 --> 01:28:13,350
 that that actually

3428
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:13,350
 

3429
01:28:09,090 --> 01:28:16,200
 the regulatory burdens may not in fact

3430
01:28:13,340 --> 01:28:16,200
 

3431
01:28:13,350 --> 01:28:18,690
 solve the problems that that these

3432
01:28:16,190 --> 01:28:18,690
 

3433
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:21,600
 systems are really bringing forward I do

3434
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:21,600
 

3435
01:28:18,690 --> 01:28:25,950
 want to think a little bit more

3436
01:28:21,590 --> 01:28:25,950
 

3437
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:30,000
 abstractly about the government as sort

3438
01:28:25,940 --> 01:28:30,000
 

3439
01:28:25,950 --> 01:28:31,920
 of representative body of people think

3440
01:28:29,990 --> 01:28:31,920
 

3441
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:34,200
 about governance not just government's

3442
01:28:31,910 --> 01:28:34,200
 

3443
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:36,540
 but that when a government uses the

3444
01:28:34,190 --> 01:28:36,540
 

3445
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:39,570
 system there is sort of public interests

3446
01:28:36,530 --> 01:28:39,570
 

3447
01:28:36,540 --> 01:28:41,340
 social interest in having an input to

3448
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:41,340
 

3449
01:28:39,570 --> 01:28:43,920
 what that system is and how it works and

3450
01:28:41,330 --> 01:28:43,920
 

3451
01:28:41,340 --> 01:28:46,680
 what it does and whether it mediates the

3452
01:28:43,910 --> 01:28:46,680
 

3453
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:51,090
 government's policy into the world in a

3454
01:28:46,670 --> 01:28:51,090
 

3455
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:54,030
 way that we're comfortable with and

3456
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:54,030
 

3457
01:28:51,090 --> 01:28:56,460
 that's something that maybe requires

3458
01:28:54,020 --> 01:28:56,460
 

3459
01:28:54,030 --> 01:28:57,840
 some you know not just freedom of

3460
01:28:56,450 --> 01:28:57,840
 

3461
01:28:56,460 --> 01:28:59,850
 information laws but other things like

3462
01:28:57,830 --> 01:28:59,850
 

3463
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:01,800
 notice laws right do we publish ahead of

3464
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:01,800
 

3465
01:28:59,850 --> 01:29:05,190
 time what the system is going to do

3466
01:29:01,790 --> 01:29:05,190
 

3467
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:09,660
 there in the US the first transparency

3468
01:29:05,180 --> 01:29:09,660
 

3469
01:29:05,190 --> 01:29:12,480
 law was or the first technology focus

3470
01:29:09,650 --> 01:29:12,480
 

3471
01:29:09,660 --> 01:29:20,180
 transparency law was the Privacy Act of

3472
01:29:12,470 --> 01:29:20,180
 

3473
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:22,170
 1974 1974 which required that agencies

3474
01:29:20,170 --> 01:29:22,170
 

3475
01:29:20,180 --> 01:29:27,300
 publish what are called system record

3476
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:27,300
 

3477
01:29:22,170 --> 01:29:29,490
 notices that define when a database

3478
01:29:27,290 --> 01:29:29,490
 

3479
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:31,770
 about citizens is being created they

3480
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:31,770
 

3481
01:29:29,490 --> 01:29:33,870
 define what data is going into it and

3482
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:33,870
 

3483
01:29:31,770 --> 01:29:36,570
 some other sort of very high level

3484
01:29:33,860 --> 01:29:36,570
 

3485
01:29:33,870 --> 01:29:39,900
 details about the existence and scope of

3486
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:39,900
 

3487
01:29:36,570 --> 01:29:42,510
 that system and so that doesn't maybe

3488
01:29:39,890 --> 01:29:42,510
 

3489
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:44,400
 help us answer questions like is the

3490
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:44,400
 

3491
01:29:42,510 --> 01:29:48,420
 system going to be equitable to people

3492
01:29:44,390 --> 01:29:48,420
 

3493
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:49,920
 of all races but it does allow us to use

3494
01:29:48,410 --> 01:29:49,920
 

3495
01:29:48,420 --> 01:29:53,730
 tools like freedom of information laws

3496
01:29:49,910 --> 01:29:53,730
 

3497
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:55,890
 or other policymaking tools to to start

3498
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:55,890
 

3499
01:29:53,730 --> 01:29:58,710
 to explore those questions so that's

3500
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:58,710
 

3501
01:29:55,890 --> 01:30:01,350
 interesting let's now take about 30

3502
01:29:58,700 --> 01:30:01,350
 

3503
01:29:58,710 --> 01:30:03,720
 seconds to talk specifically about what

3504
01:30:01,340 --> 01:30:03,720
 

3505
01:30:01,350 --> 01:30:05,940
 those fairness equities in a police face

3506
01:30:03,710 --> 01:30:05,940
 

3507
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:08,310
 recognition system might look like what

3508
01:30:05,930 --> 01:30:08,310
 

3509
01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:10,920
 might go wrong here so go ahead and find

3510
01:30:08,300 --> 01:30:10,920
 

3511
01:30:08,310 --> 01:30:14,540
 your neighbor and take 30 seconds to do

3512
01:30:10,910 --> 01:30:14,540
 

3513
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:14,540
 that and then it will bring us back

3514
01:30:21,150 --> 01:30:21,150
 

3515
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:24,180
 train data box

3516
01:30:33,660 --> 01:30:33,660
 

3517
01:30:33,670 --> 01:30:43,730
 there's data everywhere the data mining

3518
01:30:36,220 --> 01:30:43,730
 

3519
01:30:36,230 --> 01:30:46,900
 moratorium Act of 2004 some reason was

3520
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:46,900
 

3521
01:30:43,730 --> 01:30:46,900
 good they said there was no evidence and

3522
01:30:47,970 --> 01:30:47,970
 

3523
01:30:47,980 --> 01:30:56,450
 yet like the other thing I would say

3524
01:30:54,790 --> 01:30:56,450
 

3525
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:58,310
 here is that there's an automation bias

3526
01:30:56,440 --> 01:30:58,310
 

3527
01:30:56,450 --> 01:30:59,630
 problem so suppose that what happens is

3528
01:30:58,300 --> 01:30:59,630
 

3529
01:30:58,310 --> 01:31:01,790
 this has been a probe photo and you get

3530
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:01,790
 

3531
01:30:59,630 --> 01:31:06,640
 back like five or ten or as is done in

3532
01:31:01,780 --> 01:31:06,640
 

3533
01:31:01,790 --> 01:31:06,640
 New City 250 photos

3534
01:31:12,390 --> 01:31:12,390
 

3535
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:15,100
 so on this one I think we might pass

3536
01:31:13,950 --> 01:31:15,100
 

3537
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:16,000
 them back and forth like if you feel

3538
01:31:15,090 --> 01:31:16,000
 

3539
01:31:15,100 --> 01:31:18,300
 like there's something feel free of

3540
01:31:15,990 --> 01:31:18,300
 

3541
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,300
 course

3542
01:31:50,929 --> 01:31:50,929
 

3543
01:31:50,939 --> 01:31:53,939
 you

3544
01:32:14,190 --> 01:32:14,190
 

3545
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:20,240
 all right so what fairness equity czarek

3546
01:32:17,980 --> 01:32:20,240
 

3547
01:32:17,990 --> 01:32:24,920
 stake in the system whatever what have

3548
01:32:20,230 --> 01:32:24,920
 

3549
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:27,190
 y'all talked about we can talk to you

3550
01:32:24,910 --> 01:32:27,190
 

3551
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:27,190
 but

3552
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:33,240
 

3553
01:32:33,250 --> 01:32:36,150
 one leader

3554
01:32:37,090 --> 01:32:37,090
 

3555
01:32:37,100 --> 01:32:45,719
 yeah so it's it's a little bit strange

3556
01:32:43,729 --> 01:32:45,719
 

3557
01:32:43,739 --> 01:32:46,940
 to talk about fairness I think in the

3558
01:32:45,709 --> 01:32:46,940
 

3559
01:32:45,719 --> 01:32:48,840
 context of a police investigation

3560
01:32:46,930 --> 01:32:48,840
 

3561
01:32:46,940 --> 01:32:51,480
 because we often think police

3562
01:32:48,830 --> 01:32:51,480
 

3563
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:54,630
 investigations as you know Scotland Yard

3564
01:32:51,470 --> 01:32:54,630
 

3565
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:56,790
 always gets their man or that it's

3566
01:32:54,620 --> 01:32:56,790
 

3567
01:32:54,630 --> 01:32:59,910
 important to get the right person not

3568
01:32:56,780 --> 01:32:59,910
 

3569
01:32:56,790 --> 01:33:01,679
 just to you know bring in the an equal

3570
01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:01,679
 

3571
01:32:59,910 --> 01:33:03,840
 number of white suspects and black

3572
01:33:01,669 --> 01:33:03,840
 

3573
01:33:01,679 --> 01:33:05,850
 suspects and female suspects and and

3574
01:33:03,830 --> 01:33:05,850
 

3575
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:08,730
 whatever whatever other protected

3576
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:08,730
 

3577
01:33:05,850 --> 01:33:11,790
 attribute you want that there's there's

3578
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:11,790
 

3579
01:33:08,730 --> 01:33:17,010
 a sort of ground truth that we believe

3580
01:33:11,780 --> 01:33:17,010
 

3581
01:33:11,790 --> 01:33:20,460
 in but what might make that challenging

3582
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:20,460
 

3583
01:33:17,010 --> 01:33:22,410
 didn't yeah so one thing is lots of

3584
01:33:20,450 --> 01:33:22,410
 

3585
01:33:20,460 --> 01:33:24,900
 issues with just training data right

3586
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:24,900
 

3587
01:33:22,410 --> 01:33:26,280
 with facial recognition systems so back

3588
01:33:24,890 --> 01:33:26,280
 

3589
01:33:24,900 --> 01:33:27,780
 in the day when cameras were developed

3590
01:33:26,270 --> 01:33:27,780
 

3591
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:30,270
 the camera chemistry is actually

3592
01:33:27,770 --> 01:33:30,270
 

3593
01:33:27,780 --> 01:33:31,940
 different for people of color versus

3594
01:33:30,260 --> 01:33:31,940
 

3595
01:33:30,270 --> 01:33:35,070
 lighter skinned folks

3596
01:33:31,930 --> 01:33:35,070
 

3597
01:33:31,940 --> 01:33:37,580
 so let's actually change photos in order

3598
01:33:35,060 --> 01:33:37,580
 

3599
01:33:35,070 --> 01:33:39,929
 to make it possible to photograph

3600
01:33:37,570 --> 01:33:39,929
 

3601
01:33:37,580 --> 01:33:41,610
 light-skinned people accurately the

3602
01:33:39,919 --> 01:33:41,610
 

3603
01:33:39,929 --> 01:33:44,250
 camera chemistry was calibrated film

3604
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:44,250
 

3605
01:33:41,610 --> 01:33:45,780
 chemistry was calibrated to enable that

3606
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:45,780
 

3607
01:33:44,250 --> 01:33:48,929
 and a side effect of that calibration

3608
01:33:45,770 --> 01:33:48,929
 

3609
01:33:45,780 --> 01:33:50,989
 was that it didn't work very well

3610
01:33:48,919 --> 01:33:50,989
 

3611
01:33:48,929 --> 01:33:55,320
 to photograph dark-skinned people and

3612
01:33:50,979 --> 01:33:55,320
 

3613
01:33:50,989 --> 01:33:58,260
 that behavior that performance was

3614
01:33:55,310 --> 01:33:58,260
 

3615
01:33:55,320 --> 01:33:59,699
 copied in the calibration of early

3616
01:33:58,250 --> 01:33:59,699
 

3617
01:33:58,260 --> 01:34:01,080
 digital cameras so that they would

3618
01:33:59,689 --> 01:34:01,080
 

3619
01:33:59,699 --> 01:34:03,300
 behave like film cameras and be

3620
01:34:01,070 --> 01:34:03,300
 

3621
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:08,310
 acceptable to consumers as a kind of

3622
01:34:03,290 --> 01:34:08,310
 

3623
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:11,880
 natural substitute for a film camera the

3624
01:34:08,300 --> 01:34:11,880
 

3625
01:34:08,310 --> 01:34:13,350
 I think the other training data bias

3626
01:34:11,870 --> 01:34:13,350
 

3627
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:16,340
 issues in face recognition systems are

3628
01:34:13,340 --> 01:34:16,340
 

3629
01:34:13,350 --> 01:34:18,330
 often pipelines so you might start by

3630
01:34:16,330 --> 01:34:18,330
 

3631
01:34:16,340 --> 01:34:20,130
 detecting a face and then closed

3632
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:20,130
 

3633
01:34:18,330 --> 01:34:24,510
 cropping it and then passing that off to

3634
01:34:20,120 --> 01:34:24,510
 

3635
01:34:20,130 --> 01:34:26,340
 some sort of system probably semantic

3636
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:26,340
 

3637
01:34:24,510 --> 01:34:28,080
 embedding system and then you learn from

3638
01:34:26,330 --> 01:34:28,080
 

3639
01:34:26,340 --> 01:34:30,150
 that and embedding that allows you to

3640
01:34:28,070 --> 01:34:30,150
 

3641
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:33,840
 get out to an identity at the at the far

3642
01:34:30,140 --> 01:34:33,840
 

3643
01:34:30,150 --> 01:34:36,840
 end so each of these stages is trained

3644
01:34:33,830 --> 01:34:36,840
 

3645
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:39,420
 on separate data and you have to ask

3646
01:34:36,830 --> 01:34:39,420
 

3647
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:41,280
 yourself do those data at every stage

3648
01:34:39,410 --> 01:34:41,280
 

3649
01:34:39,420 --> 01:34:43,739
 represent the population to whom you're

3650
01:34:41,270 --> 01:34:43,739
 

3651
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:45,510
 applying the face recognition system

3652
01:34:43,729 --> 01:34:45,510
 

3653
01:34:43,739 --> 01:34:46,460
 because you're really only bringing the

3654
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:46,460
 

3655
01:34:45,510 --> 01:34:49,250
 background set that

3656
01:34:46,450 --> 01:34:49,250
 

3657
01:34:46,460 --> 01:34:51,380
 people who are possible to be identified

3658
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:51,380
 

3659
01:34:49,250 --> 01:34:53,870
 by the system in at the very end of the

3660
01:34:51,370 --> 01:34:53,870
 

3661
01:34:51,380 --> 01:34:55,400
 process but maybe the features you

3662
01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:55,400
 

3663
01:34:53,870 --> 01:34:56,960
 learned to try to distinguish these

3664
01:34:55,390 --> 01:34:56,960
 

3665
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:59,960
 people from each other don't actually

3666
01:34:56,950 --> 01:34:59,960
 

3667
01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:02,060
 represent that population of people in a

3668
01:34:59,950 --> 01:35:02,060
 

3669
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:07,190
 meaningful way and so won't do a good

3670
01:35:02,050 --> 01:35:07,190
 

3671
01:35:02,060 --> 01:35:08,989
 job of distinguishing among people and

3672
01:35:07,180 --> 01:35:08,989
 

3673
01:35:07,190 --> 01:35:10,430
 actually similar a similar kind of

3674
01:35:08,979 --> 01:35:10,430
 

3675
01:35:08,989 --> 01:35:11,930
 look-alike problem comes from the way

3676
01:35:10,420 --> 01:35:11,930
 

3677
01:35:10,430 --> 01:35:13,940
 the system is used right so if you

3678
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:13,940
 

3679
01:35:11,930 --> 01:35:15,739
 imagine what is the UI for a detective

3680
01:35:13,930 --> 01:35:15,739
 

3681
01:35:13,940 --> 01:35:17,510
 using the system well they're going to

3682
01:35:15,729 --> 01:35:17,510
 

3683
01:35:15,739 --> 01:35:20,600
 have their crime-scene probe photo which

3684
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:20,600
 

3685
01:35:17,510 --> 01:35:23,540
 is like a lower-resolution or maybe

3686
01:35:20,590 --> 01:35:23,540
 

3687
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:26,270
 blurry piece of surveillance footage

3688
01:35:23,530 --> 01:35:26,270
 

3689
01:35:23,540 --> 01:35:27,739
 that they've gotten a good frame out of

3690
01:35:26,260 --> 01:35:27,739
 

3691
01:35:26,270 --> 01:35:28,790
 they're submitting to the system maybe

3692
01:35:27,729 --> 01:35:28,790
 

3693
01:35:27,739 --> 01:35:31,160
 they submit the whole video to the

3694
01:35:28,780 --> 01:35:31,160
 

3695
01:35:28,790 --> 01:35:34,790
 system and it finds the frame but what

3696
01:35:31,150 --> 01:35:34,790
 

3697
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:36,950
 comes back is a set of photographs

3698
01:35:34,780 --> 01:35:36,950
 

3699
01:35:34,790 --> 01:35:39,739
 probably maybe it's one photograph it's

3700
01:35:36,940 --> 01:35:39,739
 

3701
01:35:36,950 --> 01:35:43,969
 just like this is this is you know Bob

3702
01:35:39,729 --> 01:35:43,969
 

3703
01:35:39,739 --> 01:35:46,730
 Jones who we arrested three times last

3704
01:35:43,959 --> 01:35:46,730
 

3705
01:35:43,969 --> 01:35:48,560
 year and here are his mug shots and you

3706
01:35:46,720 --> 01:35:48,560
 

3707
01:35:46,730 --> 01:35:51,140
 can confirm that it's that it's really

3708
01:35:48,550 --> 01:35:51,140
 

3709
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:53,330
 him so you have this sort of investigate

3710
01:35:51,130 --> 01:35:53,330
 

3711
01:35:51,140 --> 01:35:55,160
 and identify workflow but maybe it

3712
01:35:53,320 --> 01:35:55,160
 

3713
01:35:53,330 --> 01:35:56,989
 brings back a bunch of photographs and

3714
01:35:55,150 --> 01:35:56,989
 

3715
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:58,880
 says hey here are a bunch of people it

3716
01:35:56,979 --> 01:35:58,880
 

3717
01:35:56,989 --> 01:36:00,170
 might be and now you've presented the

3718
01:35:58,870 --> 01:36:00,170
 

3719
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:01,580
 human with a problem that humans are

3720
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:01,580
 

3721
01:36:00,170 --> 01:36:03,800
 actually not very good at right if I

3722
01:36:01,570 --> 01:36:03,800
 

3723
01:36:01,580 --> 01:36:07,130
 show you a bunch of five photographs of

3724
01:36:03,790 --> 01:36:07,130
 

3725
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:10,330
 people who look very similar which one

3726
01:36:07,120 --> 01:36:10,330
 

3727
01:36:07,130 --> 01:36:17,060
 is the one in the photo you started with

3728
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:17,060
 

3729
01:36:10,330 --> 01:36:18,680
 hard to say yeah cool so let's spend

3730
01:36:17,050 --> 01:36:18,680
 

3731
01:36:17,060 --> 01:36:20,540
 another maybe only a minute and a half

3732
01:36:18,670 --> 01:36:20,540
 

3733
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:22,070
 cuz well Josh I like this a lot

3734
01:36:20,530 --> 01:36:22,070
 

3735
01:36:20,540 --> 01:36:23,930
 apologies for that I'm gonna make sure

3736
01:36:22,060 --> 01:36:23,930
 

3737
01:36:22,070 --> 01:36:25,310
 you ask questions so what's they're all

3738
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:25,310
 

3739
01:36:23,930 --> 01:36:28,270
 a transparency here we kind of already

3740
01:36:25,300 --> 01:36:28,270
 

3741
01:36:25,310 --> 01:36:28,270
 touch this a bit so

3742
01:36:40,030 --> 01:36:40,030
 

3743
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:44,130
 I'll just actually go to the next slide

3744
01:36:42,319 --> 01:36:44,130
 

3745
01:36:42,329 --> 01:36:47,090
 and say like after a minute and be like

3746
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:47,090
 

3747
01:36:44,130 --> 01:36:49,980
 okay now that we've thought about it

3748
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:49,980
 

3749
01:36:47,090 --> 01:36:54,300
 should say like after we do this say now

3750
01:36:49,970 --> 01:36:54,300
 

3751
01:36:49,980 --> 01:36:57,619
 they thought about transparency so we

3752
01:36:54,290 --> 01:36:57,619
 

3753
01:36:54,300 --> 01:36:57,619
 can just discuss at the same time

3754
01:37:10,250 --> 01:37:10,250
 

3755
01:37:10,260 --> 01:37:13,650
 okay we'll just get where I should we

3756
01:37:12,140 --> 01:37:13,650
 

3757
01:37:12,150 --> 01:37:16,640
 skipped what fun good explanation stay

3758
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:16,640
 

3759
01:37:13,650 --> 01:37:19,200
 because we're gonna run out of time

3760
01:37:16,630 --> 01:37:19,200
 

3761
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:22,040
 actually I'll let you drive this because

3762
01:37:19,190 --> 01:37:22,040
 

3763
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:22,040
 you know the

3764
01:37:54,859 --> 01:37:54,859
 

3765
01:37:54,869 --> 01:37:57,540
 so I'm gonna bring everyone back

3766
01:37:56,209 --> 01:37:57,540
 

3767
01:37:56,219 --> 01:37:59,520
 together after a minute and a half

3768
01:37:57,530 --> 01:37:59,520
 

3769
01:37:57,540 --> 01:38:01,320
 because we want to make sure we leave

3770
01:37:59,510 --> 01:38:01,320
 

3771
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:04,440
 enough time for questions and it's

3772
01:38:01,310 --> 01:38:04,440
 

3773
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:06,119
 already 1244 so anyone have thoughts on

3774
01:38:04,430 --> 01:38:06,119
 

3775
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:08,010
 transparency in this system otherwise

3776
01:38:06,109 --> 01:38:08,010
 

3777
01:38:06,119 --> 01:38:14,210
 we'll talk about what Linda and I

3778
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:14,210
 

3779
01:38:08,010 --> 01:38:14,210
 thought we talked yes

3780
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:18,000
 

3781
01:38:18,010 --> 01:38:22,280
 that's that's on and if you pull it you

3782
01:38:20,649 --> 01:38:22,280
 

3783
01:38:20,659 --> 01:38:27,979
 can turn it down a little bit there you

3784
01:38:22,270 --> 01:38:27,979
 

3785
01:38:22,280 --> 01:38:31,369
 go something that is important for me is

3786
01:38:27,969 --> 01:38:31,369
 

3787
01:38:27,979 --> 01:38:35,360
 that if we have some transparency it

3788
01:38:31,359 --> 01:38:35,360
 

3789
01:38:31,369 --> 01:38:38,449
 should be along with responsibilities we

3790
01:38:35,350 --> 01:38:38,449
 

3791
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:42,499
 need to feel feel that okay is there

3792
01:38:38,439 --> 01:38:42,499
 

3793
01:38:38,449 --> 01:38:44,989
 there is a failure for judgment and we

3794
01:38:42,489 --> 01:38:44,989
 

3795
01:38:42,499 --> 01:38:48,110
 show everything so we are transparent

3796
01:38:44,979 --> 01:38:48,110
 

3797
01:38:44,989 --> 01:38:50,329
 but we are feeling a responsibility for

3798
01:38:48,100 --> 01:38:50,329
 

3799
01:38:48,110 --> 01:38:52,599
 the failure it may be it may be

3800
01:38:50,319 --> 01:38:52,599
 

3801
01:38:50,329 --> 01:38:54,679
 responsibility could be thanks to do

3802
01:38:52,589 --> 01:38:54,679
 

3803
01:38:52,599 --> 01:38:57,769
 yeah so I think that's I think that's

3804
01:38:54,669 --> 01:38:57,769
 

3805
01:38:54,679 --> 01:38:59,570
 exactly right and I think that's it's

3806
01:38:57,759 --> 01:38:59,570
 

3807
01:38:57,769 --> 01:39:01,190
 important to recognize that we talk

3808
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:01,190
 

3809
01:38:59,570 --> 01:39:03,380
 about these we're talking about these

3810
01:39:01,180 --> 01:39:03,380
 

3811
01:39:01,190 --> 01:39:05,239
 concepts today in a very separate way in

3812
01:39:03,370 --> 01:39:05,239
 

3813
01:39:03,380 --> 01:39:06,800
 a very kind of taxonomy way and that's

3814
01:39:05,229 --> 01:39:06,800
 

3815
01:39:05,239 --> 01:39:08,659
 that's not right right when we are when

3816
01:39:06,790 --> 01:39:08,659
 

3817
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:10,670
 we are talking about what makes the

3818
01:39:08,649 --> 01:39:10,670
 

3819
01:39:08,659 --> 01:39:12,409
 system trustworthy what makes it

3820
01:39:10,660 --> 01:39:12,409
 

3821
01:39:10,670 --> 01:39:15,979
 possible to deploy this technology in a

3822
01:39:12,399 --> 01:39:15,979
 

3823
01:39:12,409 --> 01:39:17,570
 way that's useful and and and gives

3824
01:39:15,969 --> 01:39:17,570
 

3825
01:39:15,979 --> 01:39:18,829
 people sort of warm fuzzy feelings about

3826
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:18,829
 

3827
01:39:17,570 --> 01:39:21,650
 the technology as opposed to believing

3828
01:39:18,819 --> 01:39:21,650
 

3829
01:39:18,829 --> 01:39:26,239
 that the robots are taking over and and

3830
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:26,239
 

3831
01:39:21,650 --> 01:39:28,489
 we're all going to die that that that's

3832
01:39:26,229 --> 01:39:28,489
 

3833
01:39:26,239 --> 01:39:30,559
 a kind of a coherent concept and we

3834
01:39:28,479 --> 01:39:30,559
 

3835
01:39:28,489 --> 01:39:31,760
 break it down in through this lens of

3836
01:39:30,549 --> 01:39:31,760
 

3837
01:39:30,559 --> 01:39:34,459
 fairness transparency and accountability

3838
01:39:31,750 --> 01:39:34,459
 

3839
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:35,840
 but those concepts are lean on each

3840
01:39:34,449 --> 01:39:35,840
 

3841
01:39:34,459 --> 01:39:39,079
 other and they're related to each other

3842
01:39:35,830 --> 01:39:39,079
 

3843
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:41,769
 so I think that's that's important did

3844
01:39:39,069 --> 01:39:41,769
 

3845
01:39:39,079 --> 01:39:41,769
 you have a pointer

3846
01:39:42,580 --> 01:39:42,580
 

3847
01:39:42,590 --> 01:39:48,830
 I think there's also a role for kind of

3848
01:39:46,510 --> 01:39:48,830
 

3849
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:50,659
 social advocacy as well like this

3850
01:39:48,820 --> 01:39:50,659
 

3851
01:39:48,830 --> 01:39:52,580
 transparency is kind of necessary in

3852
01:39:50,649 --> 01:39:52,580
 

3853
01:39:50,659 --> 01:39:55,610
 protecting the people that you know

3854
01:39:52,570 --> 01:39:55,610
 

3855
01:39:52,580 --> 01:39:57,980
 we're trying to protect this security

3856
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:57,980
 

3857
01:39:55,610 --> 01:39:59,480
 application then we have the understand

3858
01:39:57,970 --> 01:39:59,480
 

3859
01:39:57,980 --> 01:40:01,869
 that there there are usually implicit

3860
01:39:59,470 --> 01:40:01,869
 

3861
01:39:59,480 --> 01:40:05,630
 assumptions made in criminal justice

3862
01:40:01,859 --> 01:40:05,630
 

3863
01:40:01,869 --> 01:40:08,420
 such that ex-cons are like some of the

3864
01:40:05,620 --> 01:40:08,420
 

3865
01:40:05,630 --> 01:40:10,520
 least basically s cons have like the

3866
01:40:08,410 --> 01:40:10,520
 

3867
01:40:08,420 --> 01:40:13,760
 least rights of anybody in society and

3868
01:40:10,510 --> 01:40:13,760
 

3869
01:40:10,520 --> 01:40:15,860
 just basically like there has to be a

3870
01:40:13,750 --> 01:40:15,860
 

3871
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:18,080
 transparency of process a transparency

3872
01:40:15,850 --> 01:40:18,080
 

3873
01:40:15,860 --> 01:40:22,639
 of thought that goes into making these

3874
01:40:18,070 --> 01:40:22,639
 

3875
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:24,199
 systems actually just and making sure

3876
01:40:22,629 --> 01:40:24,199
 

3877
01:40:22,639 --> 01:40:25,719
 that we just we don't continue to

3878
01:40:24,189 --> 01:40:25,719
 

3879
01:40:24,199 --> 01:40:27,500
 marginalize people who are already

3880
01:40:25,709 --> 01:40:27,500
 

3881
01:40:25,719 --> 01:40:30,560
 likely to be oppressed

3882
01:40:27,490 --> 01:40:30,560
 

3883
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:34,190
 yeah that's fantastic and and I agree

3884
01:40:30,550 --> 01:40:34,190
 

3885
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:36,770
 and I think that we often miss the idea

3886
01:40:34,180 --> 01:40:36,770
 

3887
01:40:34,190 --> 01:40:39,770
 of transparency as sort of participatory

3888
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:39,770
 

3889
01:40:36,770 --> 01:40:41,869
 design exercise and if that happens at a

3890
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:41,869
 

3891
01:40:39,770 --> 01:40:43,580
 social level then that happens through

3892
01:40:41,859 --> 01:40:43,580
 

3893
01:40:41,869 --> 01:40:45,679
 some kind of policymaking process and

3894
01:40:43,570 --> 01:40:45,679
 

3895
01:40:43,580 --> 01:40:48,530
 that's interesting because a lot of

3896
01:40:45,669 --> 01:40:48,530
 

3897
01:40:45,679 --> 01:40:50,210
 these tools are not produced out of

3898
01:40:48,520 --> 01:40:50,210
 

3899
01:40:48,530 --> 01:40:51,800
 policymaking processes but they're

3900
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:51,800
 

3901
01:40:50,210 --> 01:40:53,599
 produced out of procurement processes

3902
01:40:51,790 --> 01:40:53,599
 

3903
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:55,219
 right I mentioned that Immigration and

3904
01:40:53,589 --> 01:40:55,219
 

3905
01:40:53,599 --> 01:40:58,730
 Customs Enforcement is building was

3906
01:40:55,209 --> 01:40:58,730
 

3907
01:40:55,219 --> 01:41:01,869
 trying to build this social media

3908
01:40:58,720 --> 01:41:01,869
 

3909
01:40:58,730 --> 01:41:04,250
 monitoring tool which would try to

3910
01:41:01,859 --> 01:41:04,250
 

3911
01:41:01,869 --> 01:41:06,250
 collect information and make predictions

3912
01:41:04,240 --> 01:41:06,250
 

3913
01:41:04,250 --> 01:41:12,860
 that had very little construct validity

3914
01:41:06,240 --> 01:41:12,860
 

3915
01:41:06,250 --> 01:41:14,540
 if any and that system was described and

3916
01:41:12,850 --> 01:41:14,540
 

3917
01:41:12,860 --> 01:41:16,040
 discovered because it came out through

3918
01:41:14,530 --> 01:41:16,040
 

3919
01:41:14,540 --> 01:41:17,179
 procurement documents those procurement

3920
01:41:16,030 --> 01:41:17,179
 

3921
01:41:16,040 --> 01:41:19,580
 documents have to be made public which

3922
01:41:17,169 --> 01:41:19,580
 

3923
01:41:17,179 --> 01:41:21,710
 is a transparency tool but there's also

3924
01:41:19,570 --> 01:41:21,710
 

3925
01:41:19,580 --> 01:41:22,880
 a transparency tool set of constraints

3926
01:41:21,700 --> 01:41:22,880
 

3927
01:41:21,710 --> 01:41:25,219
 and tools that say that the public

3928
01:41:22,870 --> 01:41:25,219
 

3929
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:27,409
 should be able to pitch in to the design

3930
01:41:25,209 --> 01:41:27,409
 

3931
01:41:25,219 --> 01:41:29,030
 of policies and maybe machine learning

3932
01:41:27,399 --> 01:41:29,030
 

3933
01:41:27,409 --> 01:41:31,330
 systems are not products that we can

3934
01:41:29,020 --> 01:41:31,330
 

3935
01:41:29,030 --> 01:41:34,400
 just take off the shelf and apply

3936
01:41:31,320 --> 01:41:34,400
 

3937
01:41:31,330 --> 01:41:37,330
 blindly in a new context but actually

3938
01:41:34,390 --> 01:41:37,330
 

3939
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:39,619
 policies that government agencies are

3940
01:41:37,320 --> 01:41:39,619
 

3941
01:41:37,330 --> 01:41:42,320
 developing and should maybe develop

3942
01:41:39,609 --> 01:41:42,320
 

3943
01:41:39,619 --> 01:41:44,619
 in-house and that should be more of a

3944
01:41:42,310 --> 01:41:44,619
 

3945
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:47,510
 negotiated process that includes

3946
01:41:44,609 --> 01:41:47,510
 

3947
01:41:44,619 --> 01:41:49,340
 activists and and and social activism I

3948
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:49,340
 

3949
01:41:47,510 --> 01:41:50,989
 should say that the Dakota on the ice

3950
01:41:49,330 --> 01:41:50,989
 

3951
01:41:49,340 --> 01:41:54,790
 system is that ice did drop the

3952
01:41:50,979 --> 01:41:54,790
 

3953
01:41:50,989 --> 01:41:58,570
 procurement after activism by

3954
01:41:54,780 --> 01:41:58,570
 

3955
01:41:54,790 --> 01:42:02,050
 a bunch of social action groups and also

3956
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:02,050
 

3957
01:41:58,570 --> 01:42:03,970
 a few hundred or maybe sixty some

3958
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:03,970
 

3959
01:42:02,050 --> 01:42:07,570
 machine learning researchers who signed

3960
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:07,570
 

3961
01:42:03,970 --> 01:42:10,740
 on to an expert letter arguing that the

3962
01:42:07,560 --> 01:42:10,740
 

3963
01:42:07,570 --> 01:42:13,540
 system was unlikely to to work I'm gonna

3964
01:42:10,730 --> 01:42:13,540
 

3965
01:42:10,740 --> 01:42:15,040
 skip over the remaining two questions

3966
01:42:13,530 --> 01:42:15,040
 

3967
01:42:13,540 --> 01:42:18,640
 which are about accountability and

3968
01:42:15,030 --> 01:42:18,640
 

3969
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:23,110
 explanations because we we are out of

3970
01:42:18,630 --> 01:42:23,110
 

3971
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:25,150
 time unfortunately and just close move

3972
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:25,150
 

3973
01:42:23,110 --> 01:42:26,890
 to our clothes by saying that this is

3974
01:42:25,140 --> 01:42:26,890
 

3975
01:42:25,150 --> 01:42:33,130
 this is also not a hypothetical case

3976
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:33,130
 

3977
01:42:26,890 --> 01:42:37,420
 that Amazon sort of poorly disguised as

3978
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:37,420
 

3979
01:42:33,130 --> 01:42:39,610
 Z Corp has a face recognition API that

3980
01:42:37,410 --> 01:42:39,610
 

3981
01:42:37,420 --> 01:42:41,980
 API is used by and marketed aggressively

3982
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:41,980
 

3983
01:42:39,610 --> 01:42:44,890
 to police departments around the country

3984
01:42:41,970 --> 01:42:44,890
 

3985
01:42:41,980 --> 01:42:46,480
 the ACLU did a test where they gathered

3986
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:46,480
 

3987
01:42:44,890 --> 01:42:48,790
 some publicly available mug shots and

3988
01:42:46,470 --> 01:42:48,790
 

3989
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:51,730
 loaded them into this product and then

3990
01:42:48,780 --> 01:42:51,730
 

3991
01:42:48,790 --> 01:42:53,980
 queried against them with the official

3992
01:42:51,720 --> 01:42:53,980
 

3993
01:42:51,730 --> 01:42:56,770
 portraits of every member of the US

3994
01:42:53,970 --> 01:42:56,770
 

3995
01:42:53,980 --> 01:42:58,900
 Congress this is actually for full

3996
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:58,900
 

3997
01:42:56,770 --> 01:43:01,540
 disclosure a project that I worked on

3998
01:42:58,890 --> 01:43:01,540
 

3999
01:42:58,900 --> 01:43:03,970
 not in the design or execution of the

4000
01:43:01,530 --> 01:43:03,970
 

4001
01:43:01,540 --> 01:43:07,990
 study but in replicating it before it

4002
01:43:03,960 --> 01:43:07,990
 

4003
01:43:03,970 --> 01:43:13,210
 was made public and they discovered in

4004
01:43:07,980 --> 01:43:13,210
 

4005
01:43:07,990 --> 01:43:15,640
 the study that about was 17 members of

4006
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:15,640
 

4007
01:43:13,210 --> 01:43:17,650
 Congress something like that were 28

4008
01:43:15,630 --> 01:43:17,650
 

4009
01:43:15,640 --> 01:43:19,330
 members of Congress were identified 20

4010
01:43:17,640 --> 01:43:19,330
 

4011
01:43:17,650 --> 01:43:22,180
 members of Congress were identified like

4012
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:22,180
 

4013
01:43:19,330 --> 01:43:25,330
 Oh 28 it says right in the headline am I

4014
01:43:22,170 --> 01:43:25,330
 

4015
01:43:22,180 --> 01:43:27,310
 not reading my own notes 28 members of

4016
01:43:25,320 --> 01:43:27,310
 

4017
01:43:25,330 --> 01:43:29,560
 Congress were falsely identified as

4018
01:43:27,300 --> 01:43:29,560
 

4019
01:43:27,310 --> 01:43:31,660
 being in the mug shots set that were

4020
01:43:29,550 --> 01:43:31,660
 

4021
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:34,060
 gathered from from publicly available

4022
01:43:31,650 --> 01:43:34,060
 

4023
01:43:31,660 --> 01:43:35,770
 sources of real mug shots in California

4024
01:43:34,050 --> 01:43:35,770
 

4025
01:43:34,060 --> 01:43:37,060
 which did not contain mug shots of any

4026
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:37,060
 

4027
01:43:35,770 --> 01:43:38,290
 members of Congress which is not to say

4028
01:43:37,050 --> 01:43:38,290
 

4029
01:43:37,060 --> 01:43:43,900
 that there are no members of Congress

4030
01:43:38,280 --> 01:43:43,900
 

4031
01:43:38,290 --> 01:43:45,580
 with mug shots so let's jump quickly

4032
01:43:43,890 --> 01:43:45,580
 

4033
01:43:43,900 --> 01:43:47,740
 into our closing slides then we'll take

4034
01:43:45,570 --> 01:43:47,740
 

4035
01:43:45,580 --> 01:43:51,040
 some questions and then we'll wrap up

4036
01:43:47,730 --> 01:43:51,040
 

4037
01:43:47,740 --> 01:43:53,800
 sure so overall what have we learned

4038
01:43:51,030 --> 01:43:53,800
 

4039
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:55,840
 from these cases well the first thing is

4040
01:43:53,790 --> 01:43:55,840
 

4041
01:43:53,800 --> 01:43:57,520
 that just all problems with machine

4042
01:43:55,830 --> 01:43:57,520
 

4043
01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:58,990
 learning you kind of have to understand

4044
01:43:57,510 --> 01:43:58,990
 

4045
01:43:57,520 --> 01:44:00,880
 them understand their context of use

4046
01:43:58,980 --> 01:44:00,880
 

4047
01:43:58,990 --> 01:44:02,500
 understand the context in which the data

4048
01:44:00,870 --> 01:44:02,500
 

4049
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:05,290
 was collected understand the context of

4050
01:44:02,490 --> 01:44:05,290
 

4051
01:44:02,500 --> 01:44:07,420
 the development and in particular right

4052
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:07,420
 

4053
01:44:05,290 --> 01:44:08,060
 this notion that data plus machine

4054
01:44:07,410 --> 01:44:08,060
 

4055
01:44:07,420 --> 01:44:09,800
 learning or

4056
01:44:08,050 --> 01:44:09,800
 

4057
01:44:08,060 --> 01:44:12,170
 Dayna plus deep-learning our data plus

4058
01:44:09,790 --> 01:44:12,170
 

4059
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:14,450
 computational tools we'll just solve a

4060
01:44:12,160 --> 01:44:14,450
 

4061
01:44:12,170 --> 01:44:16,210
 problem isn't really an answer right

4062
01:44:14,440 --> 01:44:16,210
 

4063
01:44:14,450 --> 01:44:18,710
 it's an invitation to ask more questions

4064
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:18,710
 

4065
01:44:16,210 --> 01:44:19,880
 machine learning is a fantastic use in

4066
01:44:18,700 --> 01:44:19,880
 

4067
01:44:18,710 --> 01:44:25,610
 these social contexts --is of the

4068
01:44:19,870 --> 01:44:25,610
 

4069
01:44:19,880 --> 01:44:27,260
 diagnostic tool use it as such I think

4070
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:27,260
 

4071
01:44:25,610 --> 01:44:29,060
 the other thing we want to remember is

4072
01:44:27,250 --> 01:44:29,060
 

4073
01:44:27,260 --> 01:44:31,160
 that different people or different

4074
01:44:29,050 --> 01:44:31,160
 

4075
01:44:29,060 --> 01:44:33,320
 groups of people are going to define the

4076
01:44:31,150 --> 01:44:33,320
 

4077
01:44:31,160 --> 01:44:35,090
 problem in different ways they're going

4078
01:44:33,310 --> 01:44:35,090
 

4079
01:44:33,320 --> 01:44:38,450
 to see different parts of the problem as

4080
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:38,450
 

4081
01:44:35,090 --> 01:44:41,960
 being the key components of the problem

4082
01:44:38,440 --> 01:44:41,960
 

4083
01:44:38,450 --> 01:44:43,480
 and we shouldn't believe that the way

4084
01:44:41,950 --> 01:44:43,480
 

4085
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:45,470
 that we want to frame the problem

4086
01:44:43,470 --> 01:44:45,470
 

4087
01:44:43,480 --> 01:44:48,170
 computationally or the way that we would

4088
01:44:45,460 --> 01:44:48,170
 

4089
01:44:45,470 --> 01:44:51,650
 have learned in our machine learning 101

4090
01:44:48,160 --> 01:44:51,650
 

4091
01:44:48,170 --> 01:44:53,150
 class is the right way and in particular

4092
01:44:51,640 --> 01:44:53,150
 

4093
01:44:51,650 --> 01:44:56,180
 that's expressed in the ways that

4094
01:44:53,140 --> 01:44:56,180
 

4095
01:44:53,150 --> 01:45:00,920
 different communities use words like

4096
01:44:56,170 --> 01:45:00,920
 

4097
01:44:56,180 --> 01:45:03,680
 fairness or even algorithm and that's

4098
01:45:00,910 --> 01:45:03,680
 

4099
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:06,050
 something that men and I should have a

4100
01:45:03,670 --> 01:45:06,050
 

4101
01:45:03,680 --> 01:45:10,370
 paper posted on the Internet

4102
01:45:06,040 --> 01:45:10,370
 

4103
01:45:06,050 --> 01:45:12,340
 any day now so we're we're very excited

4104
01:45:10,360 --> 01:45:12,340
 

4105
01:45:10,370 --> 01:45:16,670
 about that

4106
01:45:12,330 --> 01:45:16,670
 

4107
01:45:12,340 --> 01:45:18,560
 to close I want to say that if we

4108
01:45:16,660 --> 01:45:18,560
 

4109
01:45:16,670 --> 01:45:21,200
 believe that the systems that we build

4110
01:45:18,550 --> 01:45:21,200
 

4111
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:24,080
 should include people in society it's

4112
01:45:21,190 --> 01:45:24,080
 

4113
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:26,810
 incumbent on us to make them reflective

4114
01:45:24,070 --> 01:45:26,810
 

4115
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:28,670
 of human values and that process is is a

4116
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:28,670
 

4117
01:45:26,810 --> 01:45:30,710
 process it's a negotiation it's not

4118
01:45:28,660 --> 01:45:30,710
 

4119
01:45:28,670 --> 01:45:34,940
 something where we can just define those

4120
01:45:30,700 --> 01:45:34,940
 

4121
01:45:30,710 --> 01:45:37,670
 values and then apply them to to the

4122
01:45:34,930 --> 01:45:37,670
 

4123
01:45:34,940 --> 01:45:41,950
 rest of society and believe that that

4124
01:45:37,660 --> 01:45:41,950
 

4125
01:45:37,670 --> 01:45:44,720
 will somehow work or be acceptable and

4126
01:45:41,940 --> 01:45:44,720
 

4127
01:45:41,950 --> 01:45:47,540
 so to wrap up then you had one more

4128
01:45:44,710 --> 01:45:47,540
 

4129
01:45:44,720 --> 01:45:50,240
 point yeah there we go there's no

4130
01:45:47,530 --> 01:45:50,240
 

4131
01:45:47,540 --> 01:45:51,740
 substitute for thinking right so much

4132
01:45:50,230 --> 01:45:51,740
 

4133
01:45:50,240 --> 01:45:53,420
 like we saw there's no substitute for

4134
01:45:51,730 --> 01:45:53,420
 

4135
01:45:51,740 --> 01:45:55,130
 solving the problem we can say a similar

4136
01:45:53,410 --> 01:45:55,130
 

4137
01:45:53,420 --> 01:45:57,440
 thing about understanding problems and

4138
01:45:55,120 --> 01:45:57,440
 

4139
01:45:55,130 --> 01:45:58,880
 just problem solving in general so there

4140
01:45:57,430 --> 01:45:58,880
 

4141
01:45:57,440 --> 01:46:00,830
 are lots of taxonomy is that folks have

4142
01:45:58,870 --> 01:46:00,830
 

4143
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:02,300
 put out there for classifying bias for I

4144
01:46:00,820 --> 01:46:02,300
 

4145
01:46:00,830 --> 01:46:04,520
 even Miller is trying to add structure

4146
01:46:02,290 --> 01:46:04,520
 

4147
01:46:02,300 --> 01:46:05,930
 to explanations and these are great to

4148
01:46:04,510 --> 01:46:05,930
 

4149
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:08,660
 at least start having this conversation

4150
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:08,660
 

4151
01:46:05,930 --> 01:46:10,730
 to help us negotiate these values but as

4152
01:46:08,650 --> 01:46:10,730
 

4153
01:46:08,660 --> 01:46:12,590
 time goes on and things might change

4154
01:46:10,720 --> 01:46:12,590
 

4155
01:46:10,730 --> 01:46:15,710
 context of every problem is different

4156
01:46:12,580 --> 01:46:15,710
 

4157
01:46:12,590 --> 01:46:18,050
 the AWS case or the z-corp case was

4158
01:46:15,700 --> 01:46:18,050
 

4159
01:46:15,710 --> 01:46:20,780
 different than the XCore case of

4160
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:20,780
 

4161
01:46:18,050 --> 01:46:22,250
 babysitting so because of that we

4162
01:46:20,770 --> 01:46:22,250
 

4163
01:46:20,780 --> 01:46:23,900
 kind of have to remember that if we have

4164
01:46:22,240 --> 01:46:23,900
 

4165
01:46:22,250 --> 01:46:26,150
 a checklist mentality we might miss out

4166
01:46:23,890 --> 01:46:26,150
 

4167
01:46:23,900 --> 01:46:29,270
 on things and as such there really is no

4168
01:46:26,140 --> 01:46:29,270
 

4169
01:46:26,150 --> 01:46:30,889
 substitute for thinking I is lurking

4170
01:46:29,260 --> 01:46:30,889
 

4171
01:46:29,270 --> 01:46:32,480
 behind us which means that we are both

4172
01:46:30,879 --> 01:46:32,480
 

4173
01:46:30,889 --> 01:46:33,860
 out of time and fortunately done with

4174
01:46:32,470 --> 01:46:33,860
 

4175
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:35,270
 our presentation I kinda want to get him

4176
01:46:33,850 --> 01:46:35,270
 

4177
01:46:33,860 --> 01:46:47,719
 a giant shepherd's crook so he can just

4178
01:46:35,260 --> 01:46:47,719
 

4179
01:46:35,270 --> 01:46:50,599
 pull us off but yes you have it's really

4180
01:46:47,709 --> 01:46:50,599
 

4181
01:46:47,719 --> 01:46:52,250
 terrific and thought-provoking so now

4182
01:46:50,589 --> 01:46:52,250
 

4183
01:46:50,599 --> 01:46:54,260
 not as a substitute for thinking but

4184
01:46:52,240 --> 01:46:54,260
 

4185
01:46:52,250 --> 01:46:56,030
 hopefully as a compliment to thinking we

4186
01:46:54,250 --> 01:46:56,030
 

4187
01:46:54,260 --> 01:46:57,920
 have time we just have seven minutes to

4188
01:46:56,020 --> 01:46:57,920
 

4189
01:46:56,030 --> 01:46:59,840
 take questions please remind it please

4190
01:46:57,910 --> 01:46:59,840
 

4191
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:02,360
 up if you can please stay for these

4192
01:46:59,830 --> 01:47:02,360
 

4193
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:03,469
 questions and also I hope that our

4194
01:47:02,350 --> 01:47:03,469
 

4195
01:47:02,360 --> 01:47:04,699
 speakers will be able to stick around a

4196
01:47:03,459 --> 01:47:04,699
 

4197
01:47:03,469 --> 01:47:07,789
 little bit afterwards for more questions

4198
01:47:04,689 --> 01:47:07,789
 

4199
01:47:04,699 --> 01:47:10,030
 yes and actually David Robinson who's

4200
01:47:07,779 --> 01:47:10,030
 

4201
01:47:07,789 --> 01:47:12,829
 over in the corner there waving wildly

4202
01:47:10,020 --> 01:47:12,829
 

4203
01:47:10,030 --> 01:47:14,840
 has suggested that if we want to keep

4204
01:47:12,819 --> 01:47:14,840
 

4205
01:47:12,829 --> 01:47:17,809
 talking about these questions and keep

4206
01:47:14,830 --> 01:47:17,809
 

4207
01:47:14,840 --> 01:47:22,099
 thinking that what we should do is is go

4208
01:47:17,799 --> 01:47:22,099
 

4209
01:47:17,809 --> 01:47:25,630
 as a group to find lunch and david has

4210
01:47:22,089 --> 01:47:25,630
 

4211
01:47:22,099 --> 01:47:28,520
 has volunteered to to lead us so I

4212
01:47:25,620 --> 01:47:28,520
 

4213
01:47:25,630 --> 01:47:31,579
 imagine that we will gather outside the

4214
01:47:28,510 --> 01:47:31,579
 

4215
01:47:28,520 --> 01:47:33,920
 room if you're interested in sort of

4216
01:47:31,569 --> 01:47:33,920
 

4217
01:47:31,579 --> 01:47:36,170
 following along with us to to continue

4218
01:47:33,910 --> 01:47:36,170
 

4219
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:37,510
 having an interesting discussion here so

4220
01:47:36,160 --> 01:47:37,510
 

4221
01:47:36,170 --> 01:47:40,039
 I hope these discussions were

4222
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:40,039
 

4223
01:47:37,510 --> 01:47:41,989
 thought-provoking and fruitful and and I

4224
01:47:40,029 --> 01:47:41,989
 

4225
01:47:40,039 --> 01:47:44,539
 hope we can continue them through the

4226
01:47:41,979 --> 01:47:44,539
 

4227
01:47:41,989 --> 01:47:46,280
 questions and after fantastic thanks we

4228
01:47:44,529 --> 01:47:46,280
 

4229
01:47:44,539 --> 01:47:47,389
 have six minutes please if you'd like to

4230
01:47:46,270 --> 01:47:47,389
 

4231
01:47:46,280 --> 01:47:49,610
 ask a question please come up to the

4232
01:47:47,379 --> 01:47:49,610
 

4233
01:47:47,389 --> 01:47:52,030
 microphone maybe I oughta start with a

4234
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:52,030
 

4235
01:47:49,610 --> 01:47:54,170
 question so in this process of

4236
01:47:52,020 --> 01:47:54,170
 

4237
01:47:52,030 --> 01:47:56,270
 negotiating together to define the

4238
01:47:54,160 --> 01:47:56,270
 

4239
01:47:54,170 --> 01:47:58,070
 problems I wonder if we can think back

4240
01:47:56,260 --> 01:47:58,070
 

4241
01:47:56,270 --> 01:48:00,710
 to one of the things you said near the

4242
01:47:58,060 --> 01:48:00,710
 

4243
01:47:58,070 --> 01:48:01,880
 start of this talk which was that come

4244
01:48:00,700 --> 01:48:01,880
 

4245
01:48:00,710 --> 01:48:04,940
 up exactly what it was it was something

4246
01:48:01,870 --> 01:48:04,940
 

4247
01:48:01,880 --> 01:48:09,530
 like a mathematical fairness constraint

4248
01:48:04,930 --> 01:48:09,530
 

4249
01:48:04,940 --> 01:48:11,270
 is not fairness but do these kinds of

4250
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:11,270
 

4251
01:48:09,530 --> 01:48:12,710
 technical approaches which quite a lot

4252
01:48:11,260 --> 01:48:12,710
 

4253
01:48:11,270 --> 01:48:14,719
 of people here in the audience maybe can

4254
01:48:12,700 --> 01:48:14,719
 

4255
01:48:12,710 --> 01:48:17,150
 be thinking about is that one helpful

4256
01:48:14,709 --> 01:48:17,150
 

4257
01:48:14,719 --> 01:48:18,679
 input to be adding into the process of

4258
01:48:17,140 --> 01:48:18,679
 

4259
01:48:17,150 --> 01:48:21,250
 trying to figure out together what it is

4260
01:48:18,669 --> 01:48:21,250
 

4261
01:48:18,679 --> 01:48:21,250
 that we're trying to achieve

4262
01:48:21,370 --> 01:48:21,370
 

4263
01:48:21,380 --> 01:48:25,730
 yeah that's a great question and the

4264
01:48:23,589 --> 01:48:25,730
 

4265
01:48:23,599 --> 01:48:27,320
 answer is absolutely a lot of times

4266
01:48:25,720 --> 01:48:27,320
 

4267
01:48:25,730 --> 01:48:28,610
 don't we build mathematical models right

4268
01:48:27,310 --> 01:48:28,610
 

4269
01:48:27,320 --> 01:48:30,349
 I did say there are mathematical

4270
01:48:28,600 --> 01:48:30,349
 

4271
01:48:28,610 --> 01:48:32,420
 fictions but nonetheless they can

4272
01:48:30,339 --> 01:48:32,420
 

4273
01:48:30,349 --> 01:48:34,309
 actually add stylized examples and

4274
01:48:32,410 --> 01:48:34,309
 

4275
01:48:32,420 --> 01:48:36,170
 actually add more structure and through

4276
01:48:34,299 --> 01:48:36,170
 

4277
01:48:34,309 --> 01:48:37,760
 our uses of theorems and formal logic we

4278
01:48:36,160 --> 01:48:37,760
 

4279
01:48:36,170 --> 01:48:39,139
 can deduce things that otherwise might

4280
01:48:37,750 --> 01:48:39,139
 

4281
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:41,210
 have been too fuzzy for us to figure out

4282
01:48:39,129 --> 01:48:41,210
 

4283
01:48:39,139 --> 01:48:42,710
 before because like math is very precise

4284
01:48:41,200 --> 01:48:42,710
 

4285
01:48:41,210 --> 01:48:44,630
 in its language and as we saw here

4286
01:48:42,700 --> 01:48:44,630
 

4287
01:48:42,710 --> 01:48:46,730
 language is very imprecise when we try

4288
01:48:44,620 --> 01:48:46,730
 

4289
01:48:44,630 --> 01:48:48,170
 to negotiate values so there is a lot of

4290
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:48,170
 

4291
01:48:46,730 --> 01:48:50,420
 structure there's a lot of value to that

4292
01:48:48,160 --> 01:48:50,420
 

4293
01:48:48,170 --> 01:48:51,619
 as well but it's also about recognizing

4294
01:48:50,410 --> 01:48:51,619
 

4295
01:48:50,420 --> 01:48:53,119
 that just because I have a mathematical

4296
01:48:51,609 --> 01:48:53,119
 

4297
01:48:51,619 --> 01:48:55,309
 definition doesn't mean anybody else's

4298
01:48:53,109 --> 01:48:55,309
 

4299
01:48:53,119 --> 01:48:56,510
 viewpoint is not valid anymore so it's

4300
01:48:55,299 --> 01:48:56,510
 

4301
01:48:55,309 --> 01:48:58,190
 about understanding what you can bring

4302
01:48:56,500 --> 01:48:58,190
 

4303
01:48:56,510 --> 01:49:01,400
 to the table and your style of reasoning

4304
01:48:58,180 --> 01:49:01,400
 

4305
01:48:58,190 --> 01:49:03,650
 before this I would also say that the

4306
01:49:01,390 --> 01:49:03,650
 

4307
01:49:01,400 --> 01:49:05,389
 math helps us sort of negotiate and

4308
01:49:03,640 --> 01:49:05,389
 

4309
01:49:03,650 --> 01:49:07,460
 navigate the trade-offs right it's a

4310
01:49:05,379 --> 01:49:07,460
 

4311
01:49:05,389 --> 01:49:11,809
 tool and there's certainly a lot of

4312
01:49:07,450 --> 01:49:11,809
 

4313
01:49:07,460 --> 01:49:12,679
 value to be had from using big building

4314
01:49:11,799 --> 01:49:12,679
 

4315
01:49:11,809 --> 01:49:14,269
 and using these data-driven

4316
01:49:12,669 --> 01:49:14,269
 

4317
01:49:12,679 --> 01:49:15,920
 decision-making systems and maybe

4318
01:49:14,259 --> 01:49:15,920
 

4319
01:49:14,269 --> 01:49:17,269
 they're not appropriate in every case or

4320
01:49:15,910 --> 01:49:17,269
 

4321
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:19,400
 maybe we need to put some guardrails up

4322
01:49:17,259 --> 01:49:19,400
 

4323
01:49:17,269 --> 01:49:22,579
 in certain cases but I think if we want

4324
01:49:19,390 --> 01:49:22,579
 

4325
01:49:19,400 --> 01:49:28,030
 them to be usable in socially important

4326
01:49:22,569 --> 01:49:28,030
 

4327
01:49:22,579 --> 01:49:30,980
 contexts we have to know how to deploy

4328
01:49:28,020 --> 01:49:30,980
 

4329
01:49:28,030 --> 01:49:33,559
 these these kinds of abstract

4330
01:49:30,970 --> 01:49:33,559
 

4331
01:49:30,980 --> 01:49:35,929
 definitions and to me they're they're

4332
01:49:33,549 --> 01:49:35,929
 

4333
01:49:33,559 --> 01:49:38,570
 more like measures than definitions so

4334
01:49:35,919 --> 01:49:38,570
 

4335
01:49:35,929 --> 01:49:39,889
 what I imagine and I don't know exactly

4336
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:39,889
 

4337
01:49:38,570 --> 01:49:41,300
 how it works yet because that there's

4338
01:49:39,879 --> 01:49:41,300
 

4339
01:49:39,889 --> 01:49:44,449
 some sort of development process some

4340
01:49:41,290 --> 01:49:44,449
 

4341
01:49:41,300 --> 01:49:46,159
 sort of model development lifecycle like

4342
01:49:44,439 --> 01:49:46,159
 

4343
01:49:44,449 --> 01:49:47,780
 a software development lifecycle where

4344
01:49:46,149 --> 01:49:47,780
 

4345
01:49:46,159 --> 01:49:50,090
 we go through and gather requirements we

4346
01:49:47,770 --> 01:49:50,090
 

4347
01:49:47,780 --> 01:49:51,860
 we think about them we iterate on them

4348
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:51,860
 

4349
01:49:50,090 --> 01:49:54,530
 and then we continue to iterate on them

4350
01:49:51,850 --> 01:49:54,530
 

4351
01:49:51,860 --> 01:49:56,179
 as things develop and maybe through that

4352
01:49:54,520 --> 01:49:56,179
 

4353
01:49:54,530 --> 01:49:57,469
 process we do some evaluation which

4354
01:49:56,169 --> 01:49:57,469
 

4355
01:49:56,179 --> 01:50:00,409
 involves these kinds of fairness

4356
01:49:57,459 --> 01:50:00,409
 

4357
01:49:57,469 --> 01:50:02,239
 definitions as a guidepost to say hey

4358
01:50:00,399 --> 01:50:02,239
 

4359
01:50:00,409 --> 01:50:03,650
 here's something that we thought might

4360
01:50:02,229 --> 01:50:03,650
 

4361
01:50:02,239 --> 01:50:05,329
 be problematic and indeed we've

4362
01:50:03,640 --> 01:50:05,329
 

4363
01:50:03,650 --> 01:50:06,590
 discovered in this specific case it

4364
01:50:05,319 --> 01:50:06,590
 

4365
01:50:05,329 --> 01:50:10,030
 actually is a problem and maybe we have

4366
01:50:06,580 --> 01:50:10,030
 

4367
01:50:06,590 --> 01:50:10,030
 to do something about it here so that's

4368
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:11,520
 

4369
01:50:11,530 --> 01:50:19,420
 I have some suggestion I'm that just

4370
01:50:16,770 --> 01:50:19,420
 

4371
01:50:16,780 --> 01:50:22,030
 suggestion from the Marshall learning

4372
01:50:19,410 --> 01:50:22,030
 

4373
01:50:19,420 --> 01:50:23,560
 community I'm thinking that okay machine

4374
01:50:22,020 --> 01:50:23,560
 

4375
01:50:22,030 --> 01:50:26,890
 learning or artificial intelligence

4376
01:50:23,550 --> 01:50:26,890
 

4377
01:50:23,560 --> 01:50:30,610
 provides for us some some solution and

4378
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:30,610
 

4379
01:50:26,890 --> 01:50:33,790
 now it's or responsibilities that accept

4380
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:33,790
 

4381
01:50:30,610 --> 01:50:36,730
 that solution or judgment or not but

4382
01:50:33,780 --> 01:50:36,730
 

4383
01:50:33,790 --> 01:50:38,560
 when we are coming to say no to that

4384
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:38,560
 

4385
01:50:36,730 --> 01:50:40,600
 judgment there is other you know

4386
01:50:38,550 --> 01:50:40,600
 

4387
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:42,490
 conflicts that people saying that okay

4388
01:50:40,590 --> 01:50:42,490
 

4389
01:50:40,600 --> 01:50:44,830
 is the answer of machine learning or

4390
01:50:42,480 --> 01:50:44,830
 

4391
01:50:42,490 --> 01:50:47,740
 artificial intelligence so in this case

4392
01:50:44,820 --> 01:50:47,740
 

4393
01:50:44,830 --> 01:50:51,280
 what do you think if we have another AI

4394
01:50:47,730 --> 01:50:51,280
 

4395
01:50:47,740 --> 01:50:55,720
 on top of that that we are starting to

4396
01:50:51,270 --> 01:50:55,720
 

4397
01:50:51,280 --> 01:51:00,430
 negotiate with AR and you know consider

4398
01:50:55,710 --> 01:51:00,430
 

4399
01:50:55,720 --> 01:51:05,020
 all of you know actually in comments

4400
01:51:00,420 --> 01:51:05,020
 

4401
01:51:00,430 --> 01:51:07,390
 from people from AR and now reach a fair

4402
01:51:05,010 --> 01:51:07,390
 

4403
01:51:05,020 --> 01:51:10,000
 comment or something that we can say

4404
01:51:07,380 --> 01:51:10,000
 

4405
01:51:07,390 --> 01:51:13,650
 that is it positive judgment or everyone

4406
01:51:09,990 --> 01:51:13,650
 

4407
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:13,650
 would be happy at there at the end

4408
01:51:15,100 --> 01:51:15,100
 

4409
01:51:15,110 --> 01:51:20,910
 so I think that's interesting and it's

4410
01:51:18,110 --> 01:51:20,910
 

4411
01:51:18,120 --> 01:51:22,560
 often a reaction that machine learning

4412
01:51:20,900 --> 01:51:22,560
 

4413
01:51:20,910 --> 01:51:26,910
 people have is this idea that there

4414
01:51:22,550 --> 01:51:26,910
 

4415
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:29,700
 really is no difference between you know

4416
01:51:26,900 --> 01:51:29,700
 

4417
01:51:26,910 --> 01:51:32,610
 the basically the idea that humans are

4418
01:51:29,690 --> 01:51:32,610
 

4419
01:51:29,700 --> 01:51:35,210
 are just machines that are implemented

4420
01:51:32,600 --> 01:51:35,210
 

4421
01:51:32,610 --> 01:51:36,990
 with different kind of hardware and that

4422
01:51:35,200 --> 01:51:36,990
 

4423
01:51:35,210 --> 01:51:39,090
 means there's nothing particularly

4424
01:51:36,980 --> 01:51:39,090
 

4425
01:51:36,990 --> 01:51:41,910
 special about humans making a decision

4426
01:51:39,080 --> 01:51:41,910
 

4427
01:51:39,090 --> 01:51:48,090
 about humans trying to solve the problem

4428
01:51:41,900 --> 01:51:48,090
 

4429
01:51:41,910 --> 01:51:50,580
 and what we can do is somehow build a

4430
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:50,580
 

4431
01:51:48,090 --> 01:51:53,610
 sort of sufficiently advanced AI

4432
01:51:50,570 --> 01:51:53,610
 

4433
01:51:50,580 --> 01:51:55,350
 sometime in the in the future which can

4434
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:55,350
 

4435
01:51:53,610 --> 01:51:58,920
 kind of hybridize these definitions or

4436
01:51:55,340 --> 01:51:58,920
 

4437
01:51:55,350 --> 01:52:01,500
 help us to do that negotiation I have a

4438
01:51:58,910 --> 01:52:01,500
 

4439
01:51:58,920 --> 01:52:04,380
 little bit of trouble with this idea for

4440
01:52:01,490 --> 01:52:04,380
 

4441
01:52:01,500 --> 01:52:05,850
 a couple of reasons not because I want

4442
01:52:04,370 --> 01:52:05,850
 

4443
01:52:04,380 --> 01:52:07,260
 to engage in this question of like what

4444
01:52:05,840 --> 01:52:07,260
 

4445
01:52:05,850 --> 01:52:09,570
 is intelligence or what does it mean to

4446
01:52:07,250 --> 01:52:09,570
 

4447
01:52:07,260 --> 01:52:10,500
 be human or not human but I think we

4448
01:52:09,560 --> 01:52:10,500
 

4449
01:52:09,570 --> 01:52:12,270
 talked a little bit about it with the

4450
01:52:10,490 --> 01:52:12,270
 

4451
01:52:10,500 --> 01:52:17,910
 dignitary requirements in the GDP are

4452
01:52:12,260 --> 01:52:17,910
 

4453
01:52:12,270 --> 01:52:19,290
 that there is a a sense that if it's a

4454
01:52:17,900 --> 01:52:19,290
 

4455
01:52:17,910 --> 01:52:21,240
 machine that's making decisions about

4456
01:52:19,280 --> 01:52:21,240
 

4457
01:52:19,290 --> 01:52:22,800
 you regardless of how advanced that

4458
01:52:21,230 --> 01:52:22,800
 

4459
01:52:21,240 --> 01:52:26,640
 machine is there is a sort of

4460
01:52:22,790 --> 01:52:26,640
 

4461
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:29,100
 fundamental human dignity aspect so

4462
01:52:26,630 --> 01:52:29,100
 

4463
01:52:26,640 --> 01:52:32,460
 having decisions made about you by

4464
01:52:29,090 --> 01:52:32,460
 

4465
01:52:29,100 --> 01:52:34,860
 another human and that your sense of

4466
01:52:32,450 --> 01:52:34,860
 

4467
01:52:32,460 --> 01:52:37,710
 self-worth is somehow validated by by

4468
01:52:34,850 --> 01:52:37,710
 

4469
01:52:34,860 --> 01:52:41,630
 that decision process in a way that it

4470
01:52:37,700 --> 01:52:41,630
 

4471
01:52:37,710 --> 01:52:44,220
 wouldn't be through a machine that's

4472
01:52:41,620 --> 01:52:44,220
 

4473
01:52:41,630 --> 01:52:46,470
 sort of the most coherent thing I have

4474
01:52:44,210 --> 01:52:46,470
 

4475
01:52:44,220 --> 01:52:48,500
 to say on that topic you were next in

4476
01:52:46,460 --> 01:52:48,500
 

4477
01:52:46,470 --> 01:52:52,410
 line I think

4478
01:52:48,490 --> 01:52:52,410
 

4479
01:52:48,500 --> 01:52:55,680
 and do recommend any practical tools

4480
01:52:52,400 --> 01:52:55,680
 

4481
01:52:52,410 --> 01:52:58,920
 that help you to detect such biases

4482
01:52:55,670 --> 01:52:58,920
 

4483
01:52:55,680 --> 01:53:01,700
 through data or model exploration in

4484
01:52:58,910 --> 01:53:01,700
 

4485
01:52:58,920 --> 01:53:01,700
 your problems

4486
01:53:02,240 --> 01:53:02,240
 

4487
01:53:02,250 --> 01:53:06,360
 so we're laughing at each other because

4488
01:53:04,640 --> 01:53:06,360
 

4489
01:53:04,650 --> 01:53:08,760
 we started a project over the summer

4490
01:53:06,350 --> 01:53:08,760
 

4491
01:53:06,360 --> 01:53:11,130
 looking at the tools that exist and

4492
01:53:08,750 --> 01:53:11,130
 

4493
01:53:08,760 --> 01:53:13,740
 trying to figure out what they do and

4494
01:53:11,120 --> 01:53:13,740
 

4495
01:53:11,130 --> 01:53:15,690
 don't capture and you might imagine that

4496
01:53:13,730 --> 01:53:15,690
 

4497
01:53:13,740 --> 01:53:19,680
 there are tools out there that capture

4498
01:53:15,680 --> 01:53:19,680
 

4499
01:53:15,690 --> 01:53:21,660
 all of the kind of fairness metrics or

4500
01:53:19,670 --> 01:53:21,660
 

4501
01:53:19,680 --> 01:53:22,590
 definitions that have been proposed in

4502
01:53:21,650 --> 01:53:22,590
 

4503
01:53:21,660 --> 01:53:24,660
 the literature and there really aren't

4504
01:53:22,580 --> 01:53:24,660
 

4505
01:53:22,590 --> 01:53:25,860
 it really isn't a tool that that

4506
01:53:24,650 --> 01:53:25,860
 

4507
01:53:24,660 --> 01:53:27,810
 captures everything they're they're a

4508
01:53:25,850 --> 01:53:27,810
 

4509
01:53:25,860 --> 01:53:31,560
 whole bunch of these tools that are open

4510
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:31,560
 

4511
01:53:27,810 --> 01:53:34,530
 source now you can you can search around

4512
01:53:31,550 --> 01:53:34,530
 

4513
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:36,060
 for them but there isn't really a lot of

4514
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:36,060
 

4515
01:53:34,530 --> 01:53:37,740
 a sense of how you would deploy them

4516
01:53:36,050 --> 01:53:37,740
 

4517
01:53:36,060 --> 01:53:39,570
 into a workflow and I think that's

4518
01:53:37,730 --> 01:53:39,570
 

4519
01:53:37,740 --> 01:53:41,400
 what's missing and so I think this this

4520
01:53:39,560 --> 01:53:41,400
 

4521
01:53:39,570 --> 01:53:44,450
 workflow idea that I alluded to earlier

4522
01:53:41,390 --> 01:53:44,450
 

4523
01:53:41,400 --> 01:53:47,460
 is an interesting one and it's

4524
01:53:44,440 --> 01:53:47,460
 

4525
01:53:44,450 --> 01:53:51,090
 definitely something that's you know a

4526
01:53:47,450 --> 01:53:51,090
 

4527
01:53:47,460 --> 01:53:54,510
 good space for research that I don't

4528
01:53:51,080 --> 01:53:54,510
 

4529
01:53:51,090 --> 01:53:57,750
 think we have great answers for okay

4530
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:57,750
 

4531
01:53:54,510 --> 01:53:59,940
 thank you thanks Ashley great idea would

4532
01:53:57,740 --> 01:53:59,940
 

4533
01:53:57,750 --> 01:54:01,800
 be great if you're comfortable even

4534
01:53:59,930 --> 01:54:01,800
 

4535
01:53:59,940 --> 01:54:03,180
 publishing some preliminary work there

4536
01:54:01,790 --> 01:54:03,180
 

4537
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:05,670
 well we can work together on putting

4538
01:54:03,170 --> 01:54:05,670
 

4539
01:54:03,180 --> 01:54:07,800
 something well I I want to put Adrienne

4540
01:54:05,660 --> 01:54:07,800
 

4541
01:54:05,670 --> 01:54:09,690
 on the spot but actually I think the UK

4542
01:54:07,790 --> 01:54:09,690
 

4543
01:54:07,800 --> 01:54:13,350
 is is pretty far along here where

4544
01:54:09,680 --> 01:54:13,350
 

4545
01:54:09,690 --> 01:54:15,060
 there's like a public body that thinks

4546
01:54:13,340 --> 01:54:15,060
 

4547
01:54:13,350 --> 01:54:19,410
 about these issues that Adrienne is

4548
01:54:15,050 --> 01:54:19,410
 

4549
01:54:15,060 --> 01:54:21,090
 actually part of that sort of is meant

4550
01:54:19,400 --> 01:54:21,090
 

4551
01:54:19,410 --> 01:54:22,530
 to to do stakeholder engagement there

4552
01:54:21,080 --> 01:54:22,530
 

4553
01:54:21,090 --> 01:54:23,940
 are other there's a that's not to say

4554
01:54:22,520 --> 01:54:23,940
 

4555
01:54:22,530 --> 01:54:25,200
 there's no work on this right there's a

4556
01:54:23,930 --> 01:54:25,200
 

4557
01:54:23,940 --> 01:54:27,630
 project at the University of Washington

4558
01:54:25,190 --> 01:54:27,630
 

4559
01:54:25,200 --> 01:54:29,820
 called diverse voices that looks at how

4560
01:54:27,620 --> 01:54:29,820
 

4561
01:54:27,630 --> 01:54:31,890
 you would in a structured way bringing

4562
01:54:29,810 --> 01:54:31,890
 

4563
01:54:29,820 --> 01:54:34,860
 minority voices into a design a

4564
01:54:31,880 --> 01:54:34,860
 

4565
01:54:31,890 --> 01:54:36,810
 technical design process and solicit

4566
01:54:34,850 --> 01:54:36,810
 

4567
01:54:34,860 --> 01:54:38,840
 requirements I think that's very

4568
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:38,840
 

4569
01:54:36,810 --> 01:54:41,480
 interesting

4570
01:54:38,830 --> 01:54:41,480
 

4571
01:54:38,840 --> 01:54:43,850
 I don't you know that there are notions

4572
01:54:41,470 --> 01:54:43,850
 

4573
01:54:41,480 --> 01:54:47,860
 that come out of HCI about building user

4574
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:47,860
 

4575
01:54:43,850 --> 01:54:50,480
 panels that are relevant here I don't

4576
01:54:47,850 --> 01:54:50,480
 

4577
01:54:47,860 --> 01:54:53,480
 know a lot of details about any of those

4578
01:54:50,470 --> 01:54:53,480
 

4579
01:54:50,480 --> 01:54:56,210
 things but they are out there and worth

4580
01:54:53,470 --> 01:54:56,210
 

4581
01:54:53,480 --> 01:54:58,280

01:54:58,270 --> 01:55:00,260
 

4585
01:54:58,280 --> 01:55:01,370
 to speak to these to these guys and

4586
01:55:00,250 --> 01:55:01,370
 

4587
01:55:00,260 --> 01:55:02,990

01:55:01,360 --> 01:55:02,990
 

4589
01:55:01,370 --> 01:55:04,880
 them but of course we have to wrap up

4590
01:55:02,980 --> 01:55:04,880
 

4591
01:55:02,990 --> 01:55:05,870
