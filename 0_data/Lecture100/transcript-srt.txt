00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,170
 

25
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:13,720
 to introduce the Posner lecture posting

26
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,720
 

27
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:15,570
 the lecture is an opportunity that we

28
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,570
 

29
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,250
 take at nurbs to highlight the

00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,250
 

31
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:21,580
 contribution of someone in our field and

32
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,580
 

33
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:24,790
 in machine learning and the program

34
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:24,790
 

35
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:27,130
 chairs decided this year to select

36
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,130
 

37
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:29,920
 Joelle P know as our Posner lecture so

38
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,920
 

39
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:32,050
 she is associate professor at McGill

40
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,050
 

41
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,970
 University in Montreal she also could

42
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,970
 

43
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:36,820
 directs the reasoning and learning lab

44
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,820
 

45
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:41,200
 there and she leads the face book AI

46
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:41,200
 

47
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:45,270
 research lab in Montreal and so Joelle

48
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:45,270
 

49
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:47,740
 is known for her many contributions

50
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,740
 

51
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:49,270
 developing models and algorithms for

52
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,270
 

53
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,880
 planning and learning and complex

54
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,880
 

55
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:53,770
 partially observable domains she also

56
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,770
 

57
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,080
 works at applying these algorithms and

58
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,080
 

59
00:06:53,770 --> 00:07:00,820
 various domains like robotics healthcare

60
00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:00,820
 

61
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:03,070
 games conversational agents and as a

62
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:03,070
 

63
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:06,910
 student who's grown here in Montreal I

64
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,910
 

65
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:09,180
 know Joelle as well for as a big

66
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,180
 

67
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:11,830
 inspiration for many of us seeing her

68
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,830
 

69
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:14,380
 professionally in her career and also

70
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,380
 

71
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:16,180
 when I started as a student at nerves

72
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:16,180
 

73
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,290
 even though it was much smaller than it

74
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,290
 

75
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:20,230
 was still a pretty intimidating

76
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,230
 

77
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:22,570
 experience and for me Joelle was one of

78
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,570
 

79
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:25,780
 the few people who was generous with her

80
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,780
 

81
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:28,000
 time and and and approachable and that

82
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,000
 

83
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,920
 definitely helped me feel more welcome

84
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,920
 

85
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,580
 in this community so I think she's the

86
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,580
 

87
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:36,040
 perfect choice for the pose no lecture

88
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:36,040
 

89
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:40,450
 so she serves on the Editorial Board of

90
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:40,450
 

91
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:42,880
 chair and GM LR she also is the

92
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,880
 

93
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:44,800
 recipient of answer TC Memorial

94
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,800
 

95
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,690
 Fellowship by the way she told me not to

96
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,690
 

97
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,340
 read all of these but that didn't seem

98
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,340
 

99
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:50,610
 appropriate I think we should all be

100
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,610
 

101
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:54,610
 aware of these distinctions

102
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,610
 

103
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:57,670
 she's also was nominated as a fellow for

104
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,670
 

105
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:59,500
 triple AI a senior fellow at CFR and

106
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,500
 

107
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:01,480
 she's a member of the college of new

108
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:01,480

112
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,790
 

113
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:15,650

117
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:22,380
 good morning everyone it's a pleasure to

118
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:22,380
 

119
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:23,790
 be here on this stage sharing with you

120
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,790
 

121
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:26,610
 some of the things I've been thinking

122
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,610
 

123
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:29,850
 about over the last year in fact I've

124
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,850
 

125
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:32,400
 been on a path to try to understand how

126
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,400
 

127
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:35,460
 our community can establish structures

128
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:35,460
 

129
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:37,680
 standards practices to enable us to do

130
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,680
 

131
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:40,800
 better science and to have in particular

132
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:40,800
 

133
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,710
 more reliable findings there's been a

134
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,710
 

135
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:46,500
 call on a similar stage to have more

136
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,500
 

137
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:48,240
 Theory embedded in our research this is

138
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,240
 

139
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,250
 not quite the argument I'm gonna make

140
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,250
 

141
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,130
 today though I don't disagree with it

142
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,130
 

143
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:55,470
 but I do think that a lot of science

144
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,470
 

145
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:57,840
 progress has been driven by empirical

146
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,840
 

147
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:00,690
 findings and so what I wanted to discuss

148
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,690
 

149
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:02,610
 today is really some of the things that

150
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,610
 

151
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:04,350
 we can do as a community to improve our

152
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,350
 

153
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:07,230
 track record in terms of empirical

154
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:07,230
 

155
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:08,930
 science how that fits very practically

156
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,930
 

157
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:11,430
 in some of the work that I've been doing

158
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,430
 

159
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:13,350
 and while most of what I'll discuss

160
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,350
 

161
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:15,630
 today is about reinforcement learning I

162
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,630
 

163
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:18,240
 think there's many many lessons and

164
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,240
 

165
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:21,480
 findings that apply much beyond this and

166
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,480
 

167
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,910
 may be beneficial for many people so let

168
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,910
 

169
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,580
 me start by perhaps trying to illustrate

170
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,580
 

171
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:28,400
 what the thread is between the 3 R's

172
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:28,400
 

173
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:32,000
 that I've picked this morning

174
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:32,000
 

175
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:34,530
 reproducibility reusability robustness

176
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:34,530
 

177
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,780
 and as I was thinking through that in

178
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,780
 

179
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:39,570
 fact I found this quote from a report

180
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:39,570
 

181
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:41,370
 NSF 2015 that seems to say more

182
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,370
 

183
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:43,110
 eloquently than I could at least this

184
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,110
 

185
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:45,270
 early in the morning and so they

186
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,270
 

187
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:48,330
 suggested that reproducibility refers to

188
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:48,330
 

189
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:51,120
 the ability of a researcher to duplicate

190
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,120
 

191
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:52,920
 the results of a prior study using the

192
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,920
 

193
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,650
 same materials as we're used by the

194
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,650
 

195
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,670
 original investigator and

196
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,670
 

197
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:59,280
 reproducibility is a minimum necessary

198
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,280
 

199
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:03,600
 condition for finding to be believable

200
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:03,600
 

201
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:05,040
 and informative and so this essentially

202
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,040
 

203
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,750
 is going to be our program for this

204
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,750
 

205
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,940
 morning exploring aspects of these

206
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,940
 

207
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,650
 properties as they pertain to some of

208
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,650
 

209
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,950
 the recent scientific findings in our

210
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,950
 

211
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:15,590
 communities and trying to draw some

212
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,590
 

213
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:18,300
 thoughts on how we should move forward

214
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,300
 

215
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:19,350
 I'm not the first one to raise this

216
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,350
 

217
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,540
 question or concern about

218
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,540
 

219
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:25,410
 reproducibility it's been discussed in

220
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:25,410
 

221
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:27,459
 several other spheres and fields 2016

222
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,459
 

223
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:29,559
 the journal Nature ran a survey

224
00:10:27,449 --> 00:10:29,559
 

225
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:34,240
 fifteen hundred scientists asking them

226
00:10:29,549 --> 00:10:34,240
 

227
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:36,009
 is there a reproducibility crisis 52% of

228
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,009
 

229
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:40,689
 them in dark red said that there was a

230
00:10:35,999 --> 00:10:40,689
 

231
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:43,749
 significant crisis 38 percent in pink

232
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:43,749
 

233
00:10:40,689 --> 00:10:46,050
 said there was a slight crisis about

234
00:10:43,739 --> 00:10:46,050
 

235
00:10:43,749 --> 00:10:48,100
 three percent said no no no crisis year

236
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,100
 

237
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:50,170
 and another seven percent said they

238
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,170
 

239
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:53,410
 didn't know it's good to show your

240
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,410
 

241
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:55,569
 uncertainty bars right then we tried to

242
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,569
 

243
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:57,790
 tease it apart a little bit more by

244
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:57,790
 

245
00:10:55,569 --> 00:11:00,160
 fields it may be that the type of

246
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,160
 

247
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,779
 empirical work may affect the likelihood

248
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,779
 

249
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,850
 that an experiment is difficult to

250
00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:03,850
 

251
00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:07,389
 reproduce on this graph I'm showing for

252
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,389
 

253
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:09,100
 several fields on dark red weather the

254
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:09,100
 

255
00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:10,959
 scientists at some point had a

256
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,959
 

257
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:14,800
 difficulty reproducing someone else's

258
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:14,800
 

259
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:16,119
 experiment and in pink weather they had

260
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,119
 

261
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,660
 difficulty reproducing their own

262
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:19,660
 

263
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:21,610
 experiments and so the poor chemists are

264
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,610
 

265
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:23,350
 having a really hard time here right

266
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,350
 

267
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:25,629
 over 80 percent had difficulty

268
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,629
 

269
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:27,929
 reproducing someone else's experiment 60

270
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:27,929
 

271
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:30,399
 percent reproducing their own experiment

272
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:30,399
 

273
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:34,059
 biology not far behind physics

274
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:34,059
 

275
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:36,369
 engineering medicine computer science

276
00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:36,369
 

277
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:39,009
 doesn't show up on this graph perhaps

278
00:11:36,359 --> 00:11:39,009
 

279
00:11:36,369 --> 00:11:40,959
 were folded in with the others but

280
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:40,959
 

281
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:43,059
 perhaps they haven't spent the time to

282
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:43,059
 

283
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:45,399
 think through what may be the

284
00:11:43,049 --> 00:11:45,399
 

285
00:11:43,059 --> 00:11:47,410
 phenomenons and so what I tried to do is

286
00:11:45,389 --> 00:11:47,410
 

287
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:49,839
 figure out what was the incidence of

288
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,839
 

289
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:51,490
 such issues how did they apply to the

290
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:51,490
 

291
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,549
 work that I was doing that we were doing

292
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,549
 

293
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:56,319
 in my lab so let me set the stage a

294
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:56,319
 

295
00:11:54,549 --> 00:11:59,019
 little bit because our community has

296
00:11:56,309 --> 00:11:59,019
 

297
00:11:56,319 --> 00:12:00,490
 grown so much a little bit of background

298
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,490
 

299
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:02,559
 on reinforcement learning where I do

300
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,559
 

301
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:04,329
 most of my work the idea of

302
00:12:02,549 --> 00:12:04,329
 

303
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:06,610
 reinforcement learning is to enable an

304
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:06,610
 

305
00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:09,429
 intelligent agents to make sequences of

306
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,429
 

307
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:11,589
 decisions so there's a loop along which

308
00:12:09,419 --> 00:12:11,589
 

309
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:13,360
 the decisions are made information is

310
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:13,360
 

311
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:15,939
 fed into the system through this notion

312
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,939
 

313
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,449
 of a state and the agent has to take

314
00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:19,449
 

315
00:12:15,939 --> 00:12:21,639
 actions these actions are directed

316
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:21,639
 

317
00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:23,139
 towards accumulating reward and so the

318
00:12:21,629 --> 00:12:23,139
 

319
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:24,910
 objective is to maximize the

320
00:12:23,129 --> 00:12:24,910
 

321
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:27,209
 accumulation of reward over the

322
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,209
 

323
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:29,709
 trajectory or the lifetime of the agent

324
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:29,709
 

325
00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:31,360
 it's a very general framework for

326
00:12:29,699 --> 00:12:31,360
 

327
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:33,910
 sequential decision making

328
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,910
 

329
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,549
 very elegant mathematically it also

330
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,549
 

331
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:38,860
 allows the agent to learn to self train

332
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:38,860
 

333
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:40,610
 through trial and error it allows us to

334
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,610
 

335
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:43,310
 consider only very sparse

336
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,310
 

337
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:46,670
 feedback and also to have an agent that

338
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,670
 

339
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:49,310
 improves over the full lifetime and so

340
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,310
 

341
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:51,920
 from this very simple elegant framework

342
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,920
 

343
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:54,860
 we can actually solve a wide variety of

344
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,860
 

345
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,750
 problems we've had some impressive

346
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,750
 

347
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:58,010
 success from reinforcement learning just

348
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,010
 

349
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,810
 in the last couple of years in

350
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,810
 

351
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:01,579
 particular in solving some very

352
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,579
 

353
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:04,100
 challenging games and showing that our

354
00:13:01,569 --> 00:13:04,100
 

355
00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:06,500
 ELL agents could beat the best humans at

356
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,500
 

357
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:08,269
 some of these games and while these are

358
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,269
 

359
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,399
 very impressive results in a sense what

360
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:10,399
 

361
00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:12,649
 has me most excited about this framework

362
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:12,649
 

363
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,170
 is the huge potential for solving

364
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,170
 

365
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:17,110
 real-world problems and so scanning

366
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,110
 

367
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:19,130
 through the recent literature we find

368
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,130
 

369
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:21,829
 applications of reinforcement learning

370
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,829
 

371
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:24,110
 ranging for things like robotics video

372
00:13:21,819 --> 00:13:24,110
 

373
00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:27,019
 games medical intervention system

374
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,019
 

375
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:29,180
 managing agricultural crops prosthetic

376
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:29,180
 

377
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:31,700
 arm control financial training and so on

378
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,700
 

379
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:33,380
 and so forth and so you can imagine that

380
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,380
 

381
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,600
 there's a huge number of people that are

382
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,600
 

383
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:38,269
 looking very closely at this framework

384
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:38,269
 

385
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,269
 and are looking to use the results

386
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:40,269
 

387
00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:42,800
 coming out of the scientific community

388
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:42,800
 

389
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:45,140
 who are pushing the edge in terms of

390
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,140
 

391
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,180
 algorithms and models and trying to

392
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:47,180
 

393
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:49,810
 imagine what is the potential of these

394
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:49,810
 

395
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:52,610
 methods for solving important problems

396
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,610
 

397
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:54,440
 in some of my own work over the last few

398
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,440
 

399
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:56,209
 years we've considered the problem of

400
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,209
 

401
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,000
 optimizing the parameters of a neuro

402
00:13:56,199 --> 00:13:59,000
 

403
00:13:56,209 --> 00:14:01,220
 stimulation device a small device

404
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,220
 

405
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,860
 implanted that allows stimulation of the

406
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:03,860
 

407
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:07,010
 brain to prevent seizures in individuals

408
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:07,010
 

409
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:09,199
 with epilepsy in the case of this device

410
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,199
 

411
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:11,230
 we actually have an electrode doing EEG

412
00:14:09,189 --> 00:14:11,230
 

413
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:13,399
 reading in real-time of the human brain

414
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,399
 

415
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:15,079
 most of these experiments were actually

416
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:15,079
 

417
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:17,360
 done in animals I assure you at this

418
00:14:15,069 --> 00:14:17,360
 

419
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:20,269
 stage and you will understand why when

420
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:20,269
 

421
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,220
 you see the rest of my talk and so we're

422
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:22,220
 

423
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:23,600
 doing neuro stimulation we're looking at

424
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,600
 

425
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,980
 the EEG signal we're pulling out

426
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,980
 

427
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,170
 features of that and we're training a

428
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,170
 

429
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:29,870
 policy a strategy that decides when to

430
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,870
 

431
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:31,699
 do the stimulation in a way to minimize

432
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,699
 

433
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:33,380
 the incidence of seizure and ideally

434
00:14:31,689 --> 00:14:33,380
 

435
00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:35,810
 also minimize the amount of stimulation

436
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,810
 

437
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:38,300
 that's deployed you can imagine that in

438
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,300
 

439
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:42,199
 an application like this having sound

440
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:42,199
 

441
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:44,360
 empirical result matters a lot you can

442
00:14:42,189 --> 00:14:44,360
 

443
00:14:42,199 --> 00:14:46,519
 also imagine that in an experiment like

444
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,519
 

445
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,470
 this I can't afford to gather the

446
00:14:46,509 --> 00:14:48,470
 

447
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:51,410
 millions of trajectories that were used

448
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,410
 

449
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:54,380
 to train the system that are used for

450
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,380
 

451
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:58,460
 games and so one of our challenges

452
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:58,460
 

453
00:14:54,380 --> 00:15:01,100
 we go outside of the realm of games and

454
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:01,100
 

455
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:03,470
 simulators is to figure out which

456
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,470
 

457
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:05,270
 methods are reliable and which will

458
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,270
 

459
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:07,340
 transfer from the simulation domain to

460
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,340
 

461
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:09,290
 the real world where we can only afford

462
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:09,290
 

463
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:12,730
 a handful of trials maybe a few hundred

464
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,730
 

465
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:15,590
 or a few thousand if we're really lucky

466
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,590
 

467
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:17,450
 this is really the crux of the reason

468
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,450
 

469
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:19,190
 why I'm so interested in reproducibility

470
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,190
 

471
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:21,740
 and robustness and in many of these

472
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,740
 

473
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:24,200
 cases if we are managed to do that not

474
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,200
 

475
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:26,840
 only can we have better neural

476
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,840
 

477
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:28,640
 stimulation devices we can also have

478
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,640
 

479
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,380
 better at official pancreas for people

480
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,380
 

481
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:32,750
 with diabetes we can have better methods

482
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,750
 

483
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:35,390
 for discovering and treating patients

484
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,390
 

485
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:37,970
 with cancer and so when I engaged on

486
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,970
 

487
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:40,520
 some of these projects of course I for

488
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,520
 

489
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:42,290
 Asia Slee read the literature and look

490
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,290
 

491
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,700
 at everything that's happening what are

492
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,700
 

493
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:45,320
 the recent trends in machine learning

494
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,320
 

495
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:47,390
 what are the recent trends particularly

496
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:47,390
 

497
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,890
 in reinforcement learning and where can

498
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,890
 

499
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:51,080
 I draw inspiration to solve these

500
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,080
 

501
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:53,390
 important problems so this is a quick

502
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:53,390
 

503
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:55,580
 graph of the number of papers in

504
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,580
 

505
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:58,370
 reinforcement learning for 25 years or

506
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:58,370
 

507
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:59,810
 so I started working in reinforcement

508
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,810
 

509
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:02,570
 learning and looking at applications in

510
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,570
 

511
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:05,210
 robotics around 2000 so that's a point

512
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,210
 

513
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:07,490
 right around here writes about slightly

514
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,490
 

515
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:09,380
 under 2000 papers published at that time

516
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,380
 

517
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:10,910
 and what matters here is not really the

518
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,910
 

519
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:15,020
 number of paper in a given year it's

520
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:15,020
 

521
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:18,950
 really the area under the curve turning

522
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:18,950
 

523
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:21,200
 quickly to 2018 over 20,000 papers

524
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,200
 

525
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:23,720
 published this year and reinforcement

526
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,720
 

527
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:27,200
 learning and the years and over yet many

528
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:27,200
 

529
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:29,270
 exciting ones appearing this year but it

530
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:29,270
 

531
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:31,760
 makes it a challenge not only to keep up

532
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,760
 

533
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:34,970
 with the literature but also to tease

534
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,970
 

535
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:37,160
 apart within this huge volume what are

536
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,160
 

537
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:40,130
 the few gems that really hold promise to

538
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:40,130
 

539
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,750
 solve important problems and so for the

540
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,750
 

541
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:43,550
 rest of the next 15 minutes or so I'm

542
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,550
 

543
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:45,200
 going to focus on one particular class

544
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,200
 

545
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:47,150
 of reinforcement learning that have

546
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:47,150
 

547
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,950
 gotten the most attention possibly and

548
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,950
 

549
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:50,900
 show a lot of promise for practical

550
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,900
 

551
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:53,720
 applications and that is the class of

552
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:53,720
 

553
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:56,570
 policy gradient methods so in policy

554
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:56,570
 

555
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:59,080
 gradient really the idea is that you

556
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,080
 

557
00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:01,580
 learn the policy the strategy as the

558
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:01,580
 

559
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:03,530
 function and this function can be

560
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,530
 

561
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:05,630
 represented these days by a neural

562
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,630
 

563
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:08,050
 network though in years past it was by

564
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,050
 

565
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:10,459
 other regression functions

566
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,459
 

567
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:12,800
 into the neural network comes the state

568
00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:12,800
 

569
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:16,010
 out of the neural networks comes an

570
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:16,010
 

571
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:17,480
 action in the case of continuous system

572
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,480
 

573
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:19,190
 you may have one variable for each

574
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,190
 

575
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:21,140
 dimension of the system you're trying to

576
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,140
 

577
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:22,670
 control in the case of discrete actions

578
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:22,670
 

579
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,620
 you may have the probability of each of

580
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,620
 

581
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:26,630
 the discrete actions coming out in that

582
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,630
 

583
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:28,190
 neural network essentially contains your

584
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,190
 

585
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:30,170
 policy is parametrized by a set of

586
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,170
 

587
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:32,300
 parameters that I'm denoting by theta

588
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,300
 

589
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:35,090
 over here and the goal is to maximize

590
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:35,090
 

591
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:37,220
 the return as defined by the sequence of

592
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,220
 

593
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:39,830
 reward condition on the initial state

594
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:39,830
 

595
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:41,510
 and we do this using standard gradient

596
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,510
 

597
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:43,820
 descent methods we want to maximize the

598
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,820
 

599
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:46,280
 reward we consider the distribution over

600
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:46,280
 

601
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:47,720
 state that's induced by the policy right

602
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,720
 

603
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,610
 if you use a different policy you're

604
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,610
 

605
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,010
 gonna see different states and so we

606
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,010
 

607
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:53,750
 consider the expectation with respect to

608
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,750
 

609
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:55,340
 the states we see we look at the

610
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,340
 

611
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,810
 gradient of the policy with respect to

612
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:56,810
 

613
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:58,490
 the parameters and then we look at the

614
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,490
 

615
00:17:56,810 --> 00:18:01,760
 empirical return either through Monte

616
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,760
 

617
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:03,890
 Carlo or another fitted function so if

618
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,890
 

619
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:07,280
 we look at the space of policy gradient

620
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,280
 

621
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:09,320
 papers appearing that's a long list also

622
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,320
 

623
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,480
 not quite 20000 but a pretty long list

624
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:11,480
 

625
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,010
 too I've pulled out some titles of

626
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,010
 

627
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,650
 papers that are going to be presented

628
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,650
 

629
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:17,780
 this week at nerves apologies if I

630
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,780
 

631
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:20,270
 missed yours they're more than those

632
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:20,270
 

633
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:22,100
 ones just shown here and there's also a

634
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,100
 

635
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:24,830
 long list of them that appealed in other

636
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,830
 

637
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:29,870
 top conferences i clear ICML triple e IW

638
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:29,870
 

639
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:31,730
 RL Correll lots of papers as someone who

640
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,730
 

641
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:33,830
 reads that literature I have to figure

642
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,830
 

643
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:35,930
 out among all of these which is of

644
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,930
 

645
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:37,010
 course the most promising but they don't

646
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,010
 

647
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:38,630
 compare to each other because they're

648
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,630
 

649
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:41,000
 all appearing so quickly so in many

650
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:41,000
 

651
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:42,530
 cases my best bet is comparing how well

652
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,530
 

653
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,990
 they do with respect to the baseline

654
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,990
 

655
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:47,180
 algorithms most of them in their work

656
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,180
 

657
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:49,340
 include empirical results and also

658
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:49,340
 

659
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:51,320
 include comparison to some baseline and

660
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:51,320
 

661
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:53,480
 it turns out though the volume of papers

662
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,480
 

663
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:55,250
 appearing is quite large the number of

664
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,250
 

665
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:58,010
 baseline methods that they consider is

666
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,010
 

667
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:59,420
 much smaller and so there's four I've

668
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,420
 

669
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:00,800
 picked out four for today they're not

670
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,800
 

671
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,090
 the only ones but they're probably the

672
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,090
 

673
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:06,740
 ones that come through the literature

674
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,740
 

675
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:08,690
 most often trp OPP OD d PG actor all

676
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,690
 

677
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:11,930
 relatively in recent last three or four

678
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,930
 

679
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:14,480
 years or so but really used in many many

680
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,480
 

681
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:15,650
 papers high citation rates and we

682
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:15,650
 

683
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,600
 started playing with these algorithms

684
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,600
 

685
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:19,789
 and our lab trying to compare them and

686
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,789
 

687
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,889
 trying to see what are the trends in

688
00:19:19,779 --> 00:19:21,889
 

689
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:23,809
 relation to compare one versus the other

690
00:19:21,879 --> 00:19:23,809
 

691
00:19:21,889 --> 00:19:26,840
 hoping to distill knowledge that we can

692
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:26,840
 

693
00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:29,239
 then apply to our real-world problem and

694
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,239
 

695
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:31,309
 so we started with the Mojo Co simulator

696
00:19:29,229 --> 00:19:31,309
 

697
00:19:29,239 --> 00:19:33,169
 a common benchmark environment where we

698
00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:33,169
 

699
00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:35,779
 control these animated characters which

700
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:35,779
 

701
00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:38,330
 have a few joints and we compare the

702
00:19:35,769 --> 00:19:38,330
 

703
00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:39,859
 four algorithms and for the purposes of

704
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,859
 

705
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:41,359
 today's talk actually I'm not gonna tell

706
00:19:39,849 --> 00:19:41,359
 

707
00:19:39,859 --> 00:19:43,549
 you which algorithm is which really the

708
00:19:41,349 --> 00:19:43,549
 

709
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:45,830
 message is about how do we go about this

710
00:19:43,539 --> 00:19:45,830
 

711
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:49,759
 kind of empirical comparison so based on

712
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:49,759
 

713
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:51,289
 this simple experiment it seems to be

714
00:19:49,749 --> 00:19:51,289
 

715
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:53,529
 that the red algorithm is doing

716
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:53,529
 

717
00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:55,669
 significantly better than the blue

718
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:55,669
 

719
00:19:53,529 --> 00:19:57,229
 somewhat better than the orange but

720
00:19:55,659 --> 00:19:57,229
 

721
00:19:55,669 --> 00:19:58,729
 perhaps has a little bit more variance

722
00:19:57,219 --> 00:19:58,729
 

723
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:59,960
 than some of the other methods this is

724
00:19:58,719 --> 00:19:59,960
 

725
00:19:58,729 --> 00:20:02,859
 sort of what I would read out of that

726
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,859
 

727
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:05,450
 graph so that seemed a piece of evidence

728
00:20:02,849 --> 00:20:05,450
 

729
00:20:02,859 --> 00:20:07,460
 but since you know simulation is cheap

730
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,460
 

731
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:11,119
 we can afford to run a few more domains

732
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:11,119
 

733
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:12,979
 so we ran similar domains the hopper the

734
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:12,979
 

735
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:15,049
 swimmer which are variants on these

736
00:20:12,969 --> 00:20:15,049
 

737
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:17,509
 animated characters with the same set of

738
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,509
 

739
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:18,979
 four algorithms and then the results

740
00:20:17,499 --> 00:20:18,979
 

741
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:20,749
 were different all of a sudden a blue

742
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:20,749
 

743
00:20:18,979 --> 00:20:23,029
 algorithm seemed a lot better on the

744
00:20:20,739 --> 00:20:23,029
 

745
00:20:20,749 --> 00:20:24,590
 hopper environment the blue has very

746
00:20:23,019 --> 00:20:24,590
 

747
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:26,479
 small variance but then on the swimmer

748
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,479
 

749
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:30,799
 environment the blue has really large

750
00:20:26,469 --> 00:20:30,799
 

751
00:20:26,479 --> 00:20:33,619
 variance not completely surprising these

752
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:33,619
 

753
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:36,229
 are different domains but they're all

754
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:36,229
 

755
00:20:33,619 --> 00:20:37,999
 the same kind of dynamics on the same

756
00:20:36,219 --> 00:20:37,999
 

757
00:20:36,229 --> 00:20:41,090
 physics emulator running on the same

758
00:20:37,989 --> 00:20:41,090
 

759
00:20:37,999 --> 00:20:43,279
 computer and so if I can't even hope to

760
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,279
 

761
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:46,220
 have reliable comparison between these

762
00:20:43,269 --> 00:20:46,220
 

763
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:48,529
 on this simple class of algorithms it

764
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:48,529
 

765
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:50,450
 makes it a little bit challenging for me

766
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:50,450
 

767
00:20:48,529 --> 00:20:52,210
 to know what to do when I want to do

768
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,210
 

769
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:54,649
 neurostimulation

770
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,649
 

771
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:58,039
 and so at this stage we had a lot of

772
00:20:54,639 --> 00:20:58,039
 

773
00:20:54,649 --> 00:20:59,479
 heated discussion with the team and we

774
00:20:58,029 --> 00:20:59,479
 

775
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:01,849
 thought maybe we don't you know we

776
00:20:59,469 --> 00:21:01,849
 

777
00:20:59,479 --> 00:21:03,289
 didn't we didn't implement these on our

778
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:03,289
 

779
00:21:01,849 --> 00:21:06,049
 own we thought maybe we didn't pick the

780
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:06,049
 

781
00:21:03,289 --> 00:21:07,639
 right code base so we went back and it

782
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:07,639
 

783
00:21:06,049 --> 00:21:09,859
 turns out that conveniently enough

784
00:21:07,629 --> 00:21:09,859
 

785
00:21:07,639 --> 00:21:11,659
 several people including possibly some

786
00:21:09,849 --> 00:21:11,659
 

787
00:21:09,859 --> 00:21:13,279
 of you in the audience today generously

788
00:21:11,649 --> 00:21:13,279
 

789
00:21:11,659 --> 00:21:16,249
 provided code and I'm a strong supporter

790
00:21:13,269 --> 00:21:16,249
 

791
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:20,269
 of open source code and so we tried a

792
00:21:16,239 --> 00:21:20,269
 

793
00:21:16,249 --> 00:21:22,220
 few other packages all 40 RPO and so we

794
00:21:20,259 --> 00:21:22,220
 

795
00:21:20,269 --> 00:21:26,210
 tried a few other packages all 40 RPO

796
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:26,210
 

797
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:30,440
 and again we got pretty surprising

798
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,440
 

799
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:33,700
 results blue red yellow all trp Oh three

800
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:33,700
 

801
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,700
 different implementations

802
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:33,900
 

803
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:38,870
 it's not just TRP oh we tried the same

804
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,870
 

805
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:41,570
 thing with DD PG grabbed a bunch of open

806
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,570
 

807
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:44,240
 source code and again significantly

808
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,240
 

809
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:45,980
 different now on the half cheetah the

810
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,980
 

811
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,530
 blue code seems to be doing really well

812
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,530
 

813
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:50,630
 and on the you know the half cheetah

814
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,630
 

815
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:52,790
 with DD PG the red seem to be doing very

816
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,790
 

817
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:55,250
 well but it's not really clear where to

818
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:55,250
 

819
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:56,960
 go from there and so we started digging

820
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,960
 

821
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:59,420
 in a little bit more most of the time we

822
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:59,420
 

823
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,700
 started as many of you do in your papers

824
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:01,700
 

825
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:04,010
 with the default set of hyper parameters

826
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:04,010
 

827
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:06,620
 for the models so we started playing

828
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,620
 

829
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:08,030
 around with a network structure right

830
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:08,030
 

831
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:11,450
 remember I have a neural network for my

832
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:11,450
 

833
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:13,460
 policy changing the architecture looking

834
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,460
 

835
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:15,500
 at different types of unit activations

836
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,500
 

837
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:17,240
 again huge variance and results we

838
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:17,240
 

839
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,680
 started playing with reward scale

840
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,680
 

841
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:21,890
 whether we were using layer wise

842
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,890
 

843
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:26,120
 normalization huge set of different

844
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:26,120
 

845
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:27,980
 results and at this point we were

846
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,980
 

847
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:31,400
 actually quite motivated to find the

848
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:31,400
 

849
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:33,680
 best configuration but the worry we had

850
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:33,680
 

851
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:36,110
 was that perhaps people writing papers

852
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:36,110
 

853
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:38,060
 we're not always as motivated to find

854
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,060
 

855
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:40,940
 the best hyper parameters for the

856
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:40,940
 

857
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:44,440
 baseline and perhaps very conveniently

858
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:44,440
 

859
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:49,340
 often use the default hyper parameters

860
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:49,340
 

861
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:51,980
 and so you know in one sense this is a

862
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:51,980
 

863
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:54,470
 little bit of a plea but if we are doing

864
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,470
 

865
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:56,840
 comparisons as a community whether it's

866
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,840
 

867
00:22:54,470 --> 00:23:00,080
 for a baseline algorithm or for a new

868
00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:00,080
 

869
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:03,230
 your new fantastic idea to really think

870
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:03,230
 

871
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:05,690
 carefully about using the same amount of

872
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,690
 

873
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:07,610
 data and the same amount of computation

874
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,610
 

875
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:09,710
 when comparing methods that seems

876
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,710
 

877
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:11,710
 relatively simple so I hope there will

878
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,710
 

879
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:14,180
 not be much controversy about this one

880
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,180
 

881
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:15,890
 this is something we try to apply in our

882
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:15,890
 

883
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:18,020
 own group and so after much discussion

884
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,020
 

885
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:19,580
 we decided to redo some experiments

886
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:19,580
 

887
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:21,620
 normalizing in particular the hyper

888
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:21,620
 

889
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:23,780
 parameter budget happening between

890
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:23,780
 

891
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:26,330
 different methods go back to some

892
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:26,330
 

893
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:28,040
 experiment and we ran another one and a

894
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,040
 

895
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:30,680
 week later my collaborators came back

896
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:30,680
 

897
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:32,810
 and said well we have a and a week later

898
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:32,810
 

899
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:34,940
 my collaborators came back and said well

900
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,940
 

901
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:38,390
 we have a really interesting graph for

902
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:38,390
 

903
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:40,910
 you here's this one two different runs

904
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,910
 

905
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:43,460
 five averaged over five different ones

906
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,460
 

907
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:45,500
 each of them it seems to be pretty clean

908
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:45,500
 

909
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:47,570
 that orange is doing better than blue

910
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,570
 

911
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,820
 as did you spend the same amount of data

912
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,820
 

913
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:52,340
 the same amount of computation yes yes

914
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:52,340
 

915
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:56,030
 we compared these two very fairly and I

916
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:56,030
 

917
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:58,490
 asked them okay what are these two it

918
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,490
 

919
00:23:56,030 --> 00:24:00,920
 turns out both of them were the same T

920
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,920
 

921
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:03,070
 RPO code with the best type of parameter

922
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:03,070
 

923
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:06,230
 configuration that could be found just

924
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:06,230
 

925
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:09,860
 five different random seeds on each of

926
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:09,860
 

927
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:11,960
 them that's a little bit problematic so

928
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,960
 

929
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:15,650
 we thought well you know maybe it was a

930
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:15,650
 

931
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:17,450
 particularly funny run clearly n was not

932
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,450
 

933
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:19,400
 large enough we need to run most of this

934
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,400
 

935
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:22,580
 and it should somehow you know get a

936
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:22,580
 

937
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:24,800
 little tighter so we tried to do that

938
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:24,800
 

939
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:26,870
 my I system you know why did you run

940
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,870
 

941
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:29,570
 five runs why did you think that was

942
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:29,570
 

943
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:32,480
 enough clearly you know picking out that

944
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,480
 

945
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:34,340
 factor n really influences the size of

946
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,340
 

947
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,160
 our confidence interval so how should we

948
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:37,160
 

949
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:39,410
 be picking in and so my collaborator

950
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,410
 

951
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:41,930
 said well you know we looked at the

952
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,930
 

953
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:45,170
 literature saw how many trials people

954
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,170
 

955
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:47,240
 were doing and five seemed to be like on

956
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,240
 

957
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:50,150
 the upper side of thing so we thought we

958
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:50,150
 

959
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:51,710
 were doing well with five trials these

960
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,710
 

961
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:53,750
 are some of the recent papers on

962
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,750
 

963
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:56,090
 reinforcement learning not quite 2018 I

964
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,090
 

965
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:57,560
 mean it's not necessary to identify the

966
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,560
 

967
00:24:56,090 --> 00:25:02,060
 authors because I promise you they're

968
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:02,060
 

969
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:04,900
 not the only ones doing this and this is

970
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:04,900
 

971
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:08,410
 the thing about reproducibility right

972
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:08,410
 

973
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:11,480
 when enough people start doing something

974
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,480
 

975
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:13,400
 then the next generation of people think

976
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:13,400
 

977
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,500
 that's the thing to do we were taught to

978
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:15,500
 

979
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:18,080
 read the literature and follow the

980
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:18,080
 

981
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:20,240
 methodology and replicate what's in the

982
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:20,240
 

983
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,910
 paper and so not only were people

984
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:22,910
 

985
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,860
 running only five runs some people were

986
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,860
 

987
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:26,660
 doing this thing when I heard about this

988
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,660
 

989
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:30,500
 I thought it was marvelous

990
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:30,500
 

991
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:32,960
 um they would run and runs and was not

992
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:32,960
 

993
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:38,390
 specified and then they would report the

994
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:38,390
 

995
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:39,950
 top five results I thought this was

996
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,950
 

997
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:43,880
 fabulous cuz that's a really good way to

998
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:43,880
 

999
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:45,860
 get good results let me be very clear

1000
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:45,860
 

1001
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:48,140
 about what happens when you do that this

1002
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:48,140
 

1003
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:50,750
 is what happens when you run ten runs of

1004
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,750
 

1005
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:52,400
 some algorithm that has a little bit of

1006
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,400
 

1007
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:54,350
 maybe random noise and the rewards in

1008
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:54,350
 

1009
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,910
 this transition probability and assume

1010
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,910
 

1011
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:57,560
 you've got some baseline to beat and

1012
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,560
 

1013
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:58,640
 this is your algorithm that you're very

1014
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,640
 

1015
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,710
 motivated to

1016
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:00,710
 

1017
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,770
 as well so you can write this beautiful

1018
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,770
 

1019
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:07,730
 NURBS paper if you pick the top three

1020
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,730
 

1021
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:09,890
 results one there's a very strong

1022
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,890
 

1023
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:14,150
 positive bias so it becomes much more

1024
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:14,150
 

1025
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:16,030
 clear easy to beat the baseline to the

1026
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,030
 

1027
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:18,500
 variance appears a lot smaller in

1028
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,500
 

1029
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:20,870
 particular when you're doing this max

1030
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:20,870
 

1031
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:23,830
 operator in there and this is something

1032
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,830
 

1033
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:26,240
 we should know in reinforcement learning

1034
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,240
 

1035
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:28,220
 so I've been talking about these results

1036
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:28,220
 

1037
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,410
 here and there in workshops over the

1038
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:30,410
 

1039
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:32,179
 last year and you know as the message

1040
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,179
 

1041
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:34,730
 sort of at some point got a little

1042
00:26:32,169 --> 00:26:34,730
 

1043
00:26:32,179 --> 00:26:36,650
 muddled some people use this to argue

1044
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,650
 

1045
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:38,750
 that the whole field was broken and

1046
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,750
 

1047
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:40,820
 quite frankly every lab in university

1048
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,820
 

1049
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:44,120
 justice fire all of its reinforcement

1050
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:44,120
 

1051
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:47,990
 learning researchers and we should just

1052
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:47,990
 

1053
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:50,540
 not use this kind of technique and that

1054
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,540
 

1055
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:52,910
 is not my message for today I hope this

1056
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:52,910
 

1057
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:56,660
 is recorded this is not my message for

1058
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:56,660
 

1059
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:58,610
 today right my message is that sometimes

1060
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:58,610
 

1061
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:01,280
 fair comparisons don't tell the whole

1062
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,280
 

1063
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:03,860
 story and just because you give an equal

1064
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,860
 

1065
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:06,799
 amount of data budget and computation

1066
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:06,799
 

1067
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:09,080
 budget to two algorithms it doesn't mean

1068
00:27:06,789 --> 00:27:09,080
 

1069
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:11,840
 that you get the most knowledge out of

1070
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:11,840
 

1071
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:13,160
 your empirical study first of all

1072
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,160
 

1073
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:16,580
 different methods may have a very

1074
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:16,580
 

1075
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:18,470
 distinct set of hyper parameters in some

1076
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:18,470
 

1077
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:20,390
 cases if you're considering random force

1078
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,390
 

1079
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,799
 versus neural networks the number of

1080
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,799
 

1081
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,790
 hyper parameter is very different so

1082
00:27:21,789 --> 00:27:22,790
 

1083
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:24,950
 it's normal that you may need a

1084
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,950
 

1085
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:27,049
 different budget to properly optimize

1086
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,049
 

1087
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:29,450
 the hyper parameter different methods

1088
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,450
 

1089
00:27:27,049 --> 00:27:31,370
 have different variable sensitivity to

1090
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,370
 

1091
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:34,580
 those hyper parameters that should be

1092
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,580
 

1093
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:37,250
 taken into account and most important

1094
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:37,250
 

1095
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:39,350
 what method is best often depends on

1096
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,350
 

1097
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:42,919
 what is your data budget and what is

1098
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:42,919
 

1099
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:44,570
 your computation budget and so this is

1100
00:27:42,909 --> 00:27:44,570
 

1101
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:48,500
 something that I hope everyone takes

1102
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:48,500
 

1103
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:51,380
 into account this is a lot more subtle

1104
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:51,380
 

1105
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:53,450
 than just telling you to use the same

1106
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,450
 

1107
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:57,290
 computation budget and use the same data

1108
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,290
 

1109
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:59,240
 budget this requires careful thinking

1110
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,240
 

1111
00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:01,360
 about your experiment and most

1112
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:01,360
 

1113
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:05,690
 importantly it requires very careful

1114
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:05,690
 

1115
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:07,130
 reporting about your experiment and so

1116
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,130
 

1117
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:08,600
 since I've been talking about this the

1118
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,600
 

1119
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:10,130
 first time I talked about at least some

1120
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,130
 

1121
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,110
 of these results when then was in the

1122
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,110
 

1123
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:13,640
 DPL workshop a year ago and since then

1124
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,640
 

1125
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:15,860
 we've really evolved some of our

1126
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:15,860
 

1127
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:18,649
 thinking about it we went back in the

1128
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:18,649
 

1129
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:21,289
 last three weeks and looked at papers

1130
00:28:18,639 --> 00:28:21,289
 

1131
00:28:18,649 --> 00:28:24,200
 this case time only papers from 2018

1132
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,200
 

1133
00:28:21,289 --> 00:28:27,350
 that were published at nurbs ICML iclear

1134
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:27,350
 

1135
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,279
 we took a sample of 50 papers there's a

1136
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,279
 

1137
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:32,390
 lot more than that

1138
00:28:28,269 --> 00:28:32,390
 

1139
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:34,610
 but we looked at 50 papers all of the

1140
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,610
 

1141
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:36,470
 papers we considered had experiments so

1142
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,470
 

1143
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:40,309
 that's good that seems relevant for our

1144
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:40,309
 

1145
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:44,899
 discussion this morning 90% of them used

1146
00:28:40,299 --> 00:28:44,899
 

1147
00:28:40,309 --> 00:28:46,669
 the very fashionable neural networks 90%

1148
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,669
 

1149
00:28:44,899 --> 00:28:48,590
 of them described all the hyper

1150
00:28:46,659 --> 00:28:48,590
 

1151
00:28:46,669 --> 00:28:53,409
 parameters needed to reproduce their own

1152
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:53,409
 

1153
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:53,409
 methods so that was reasonably good

1154
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:54,600
 

1155
00:28:54,610 --> 00:29:01,279
 hyper parameters for the baseline

1156
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:01,279
 

1157
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:05,269
 reported in 60% of papers that makes it

1158
00:29:01,269 --> 00:29:05,269
 

1159
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:09,590
 a little bit harder for us code was

1160
00:29:05,259 --> 00:29:09,590
 

1161
00:29:05,269 --> 00:29:11,809
 linked in 55% of the cases better than I

1162
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,809
 

1163
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:14,210
 had expected I must say so the trend is

1164
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:14,210
 

1165
00:29:11,809 --> 00:29:16,730
 definitely in the right direction the

1166
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,730
 

1167
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:18,710
 method for choosing the hyper parameters

1168
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,710
 

1169
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:25,639
 right how did you optimize what was your

1170
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:25,639
 

1171
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:30,760
 budget 20% of papers some evaluation on

1172
00:29:25,629 --> 00:29:30,760
 

1173
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:34,130
 a holdout test set 10% of papers and

1174
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:34,130
 

1175
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:38,840
 significance testing applied 5% of

1176
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:38,840
 

1177
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:42,169
 papers presumably significant testing is

1178
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:42,169
 

1179
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:43,669
 the one thing we care about so there was

1180
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:43,669
 

1181
00:29:42,169 --> 00:29:45,740
 a lot of graphs that had figures that

1182
00:29:43,659 --> 00:29:45,740
 

1183
00:29:43,669 --> 00:29:48,889
 looks like this right shading looks good

1184
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:48,889
 

1185
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:50,630
 of course the challenge is when you

1186
00:29:48,879 --> 00:29:50,630
 

1187
00:29:48,889 --> 00:29:52,760
 don't tell us what your shading area is

1188
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,760
 

1189
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:54,169
 and you would be surprised about the

1190
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,169
 

1191
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,580
 number of papers that don't tell you

1192
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,580
 

1193
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:57,830
 whether you're looking at a 95 percent

1194
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:57,830
 

1195
00:29:55,580 --> 00:30:00,309
 confidence interval is 68 percent

1196
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:00,309
 

1197
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:02,960
 confidence interval a standard deviation

1198
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,960
 

1199
00:30:00,309 --> 00:30:05,649
 shading looks good but shading is not

1200
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:05,649
 

1201
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:09,200
 knowledge unless you define it properly

1202
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:09,200
 

1203
00:30:05,649 --> 00:30:13,789
 so to make it a little easier for you

1204
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:13,789
 

1205
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:16,700
 for 2019 papers in consultation with

1206
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:16,700
 

1207
00:30:13,789 --> 00:30:21,020
 colleagues we have come together with a

1208
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:21,020
 

1209
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:23,470
 reproducibility checklist the first part

1210
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:23,470
 

1211
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:25,299
 will seem relatively straightforward

1212
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,299
 

1213
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:27,039
 you present an algorithm you should

1214
00:30:25,289 --> 00:30:27,039
 

1215
00:30:25,299 --> 00:30:29,140
 include a Creely or description of your

1216
00:30:27,029 --> 00:30:29,140
 

1217
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:31,659
 algorithm and analysis of the complexity

1218
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:31,659
 

1219
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:33,760
 and you should think about including

1220
00:30:31,649 --> 00:30:33,760
 

1221
00:30:31,659 --> 00:30:36,640
 source code and it's on your conscious

1222
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,640
 

1223
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,500
 whether you check that box or not if you

1224
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:38,500
 

1225
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,409
 make theoretical claims you should have

1226
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:40,409
 

1227
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:42,940
 a statement of the results a clear

1228
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,940
 

1229
00:30:40,409 --> 00:30:47,230
 explanation of any assumption and a

1230
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:47,230
 

1231
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:51,299
 complete proof of the claim should you

1232
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:51,299
 

1233
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:53,679
 wish to include figures tables results

1234
00:30:51,289 --> 00:30:53,679
 

1235
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:55,270
 then you should think about having a

1236
00:30:53,669 --> 00:30:55,270
 

1237
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:58,860
 description of the data collection

1238
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:58,860
 

1239
00:30:55,270 --> 00:31:01,630
 process a link to a downloadable version

1240
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:01,630
 

1241
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:04,260
 some explanation of how samples r

1242
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:04,260
 

1243
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:06,610
 allocated training validation testing an

1244
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:06,610
 

1245
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:09,130
 explanation of any data that was

1246
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,130
 

1247
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:10,780
 excluded so if you're taking the top

1248
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,780
 

1249
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:14,380
 five you gotta explain to me why the

1250
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:14,380
 

1251
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:17,020
 other K were not kept the hyper

1252
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:17,020
 

1253
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:18,880
 parameters selected how you selected

1254
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:18,880
 

1255
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:21,580
 them so on the number of our valuation

1256
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:21,580
 

1257
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:24,250
 runs a description of the specific

1258
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:24,250
 

1259
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:27,490
 statistics error bars I love every bars

1260
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,490
 

1261
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:29,679
 both the central tendency the mean is

1262
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,679
 

1263
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:31,809
 great but also some measure of variation

1264
00:31:29,669 --> 00:31:31,809
 

1265
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:34,270
 and I don't really care if you give me a

1266
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:34,270
 

1267
00:31:31,809 --> 00:31:36,400
 95% confidence interval or some quartile

1268
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,400
 

1269
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:38,919
 interpretation tell me what it is

1270
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:38,919
 

1271
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:42,880
 and finally the computing infrastructure

1272
00:31:38,909 --> 00:31:42,880
 

1273
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:44,500
 that you used let me say I will make

1274
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,500
 

1275
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,419
 this available for anyone who wishes to

1276
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:46,419
 

1277
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:48,520
 use it anyone who is a program chair in

1278
00:31:46,409 --> 00:31:48,520
 

1279
00:31:46,419 --> 00:31:49,840
 2019 I encourage you to include this

1280
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,840
 

1281
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:53,950
 checklist as part of your submission

1282
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:53,950
 

1283
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:56,350
 process on the role of infrastructure

1284
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,350
 

1285
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:57,700
 right we often feel that because we're

1286
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,700
 

1287
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:59,559
 running things on computers things

1288
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:59,559
 

1289
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:01,059
 should be relatively predictable at

1290
00:31:59,549 --> 00:32:01,059
 

1291
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:04,690
 least much more so than in the other

1292
00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:04,690
 

1293
00:32:01,059 --> 00:32:08,080
 sciences remember the poor chemists yet

1294
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:08,080
 

1295
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:10,169
 it's been well documented that at least

1296
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:10,169
 

1297
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,640
 in clinical science often just the

1298
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,640
 

1299
00:32:10,169 --> 00:32:14,500
 identifier for this center where the

1300
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,500
 

1301
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:17,020
 care was given is one of the best

1302
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:17,020
 

1303
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:19,059
 predictors in terms of outcomes measured

1304
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:19,059
 

1305
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:20,830
 and so I think we still have to be a

1306
00:32:19,049 --> 00:32:20,830
 

1307
00:32:19,059 --> 00:32:22,419
 little bit cognizant of the fact that

1308
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,419
 

1309
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:24,280
 depending on how we're running our

1310
00:32:22,409 --> 00:32:24,280
 

1311
00:32:22,419 --> 00:32:26,130
 experiments they may be a little bit of

1312
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:26,130
 

1313
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:28,630
 variability especially as we use

1314
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,630
 

1315
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:31,090
 distributed training system depending on

1316
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,090
 

1317
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:32,890
 how the scheduler is used whether some

1318
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,890
 

1319
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:35,280
 of the properties of your kukuda

1320
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,280
 

1321
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:37,770
 operations and so on so there's room for

1322
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:37,770
 

1323
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:39,660
 a bit of variability even in hardware

1324
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,660
 

1325
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:44,040
 and that's why I think specifying and

1326
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:44,040
 

1327
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:46,830
 can be useful now that we have a

1328
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:46,830
 

1329
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:50,060
 checklist we should feel much better

1330
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:50,060
 

1331
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:52,950
 prepared for the next year of science

1332
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:52,950
 

1333
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:54,900
 and so I want to spend a little bit of

1334
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,900
 

1335
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:56,610
 time on another statement that has

1336
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,610
 

1337
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,630
 appeared in last year perhaps quite

1338
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,630
 

1339
00:32:56,610 --> 00:33:00,030
 controversially

1340
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:00,030
 

1341
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:02,550
 since we didn't yet fire all the RL

1342
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,550
 

1343
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:05,250
 researchers we must respond to this

1344
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:05,250
 

1345
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:06,870
 accusation reinforcement learning is the

1346
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,870
 

1347
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:08,970
 only case of machine learning where it

1348
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,970
 

1349
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:14,630
 is acceptable to test on your training

1350
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:14,630
 

1351
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:19,620
 set what's the deal here

1352
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:19,620
 

1353
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:22,830
 so in classical ARL indeed it has been

1354
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:22,830
 

1355
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:25,380
 the custom to train on a particular task

1356
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:25,380
 

1357
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:27,780
 be it a maze a maze or a game a

1358
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,780
 

1359
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:30,240
 particular game to train our agent to

1360
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:30,240
 

1361
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:33,090
 accomplish that one task and then that

1362
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:33,090
 

1363
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:35,460
 test time to run the optimal policy or

1364
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,460
 

1365
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:37,920
 the learned policy on that same

1366
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:37,920
 

1367
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:41,790
 environment and I would say on the road

1368
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:41,790
 

1369
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:45,090
 map to AGI this is a starting point and

1370
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:45,090
 

1371
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:47,700
 where we want to be is really have the

1372
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,700
 

1373
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:50,490
 ability for AI agent to test on anything

1374
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:50,490
 

1375
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:54,360
 right this is essentially AGI the world

1376
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,360
 

1377
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:57,150
 is your test set and while we've done a

1378
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:57,150
 

1379
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:59,250
 lot of good work at the left side of

1380
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,250
 

1381
00:33:57,150 --> 00:34:00,840
 that I'm here to encourage you to

1382
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,840
 

1383
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:03,090
 explore the full spectrum of

1384
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,090
 

1385
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:06,750
 opportunities that stand between the

1386
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:06,750
 

1387
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:08,190
 classical RL paradigm and AGI and so one

1388
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,190
 

1389
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:10,169
 of the things that people have done is

1390
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,169
 

1391
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:12,179
 actually to use separate tasks for

1392
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,179
 

1393
00:34:10,169 --> 00:34:16,020
 training and for testing so I'm gonna

1394
00:34:12,169 --> 00:34:16,020
 

1395
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:18,060
 run my RL agent on a class of mazes or a

1396
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:18,060
 

1397
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:20,760
 class of games and then I'm gonna test

1398
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:20,760
 

1399
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:23,880
 on a different classes of maze and games

1400
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:23,880
 

1401
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:25,560
 and while I think that's a that's a good

1402
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:25,560
 

1403
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:27,179
 way to test generalization that's not

1404
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:27,179
 

1405
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:29,100
 quite the space I'm gonna explore today

1406
00:34:27,169 --> 00:34:29,100
 

1407
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:30,480
 there's a lot of work on multitask and

1408
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:30,480
 

1409
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,550
 meta learning and so on that explore

1410
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:32,550
 

1411
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,860
 that piece I want to explore things that

1412
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,860
 

1413
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:37,679
 don't quite go that far as requiring

1414
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:37,679
 

1415
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:39,450
 different completely different tasks

1416
00:34:37,669 --> 00:34:39,450
 

1417
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:41,190
 with different goals something that's

1418
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,190
 

1419
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:43,770
 maybe a little bit closer but still

1420
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:43,770
 

1421
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:45,960
 allows much more variability between

1422
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,960
 

1423
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:48,149
 training and testing and so the

1424
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,149
 

1425
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,140
 following ideas was proposed in this one

1426
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:49,140
 

1427
00:34:48,149 --> 00:34:52,800
 we've explored this

1428
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:52,800
 

1429
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:55,620
 is to actually have simply separate

1430
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,620
 

1431
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,840
 random seeds for the training runs and

1432
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:57,840
 

1433
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:59,490
 for your test run and so this isn't that

1434
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:59,490
 

1435
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:02,130
 complicated to do assuming there's

1436
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,130
 

1437
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:04,260
 enough variance in the tasks variability

1438
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,260
 

1439
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:05,850
 in your initial state in your stochastic

1440
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:05,850
 

1441
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:08,340
 reward your transition this should make

1442
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,340
 

1443
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:11,400
 a difference right and so we defined a

1444
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:11,400
 

1445
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:12,750
 nice simple generalization error on the

1446
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:12,750
 

1447
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,570
 one hand you're going to look at your

1448
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:15,570
 

1449
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:17,490
 empirical return with the states that

1450
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,490
 

1451
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:19,170
 you visit in your training seeds and

1452
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,170
 

1453
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:21,090
 another case you're gonna have the

1454
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,090
 

1455
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:23,280
 empirical reward you see in the state

1456
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,280
 

1457
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:25,440
 that you see with your test seed and as

1458
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:25,440
 

1459
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,830
 you learn more and more hopefully the

1460
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:28,830
 

1461
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,390
 performance will reduce and we tried

1462
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,390
 

1463
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:33,690
 that on a very simple task

1464
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:33,690
 

1465
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:35,190
 this acrobat simulator and we looked

1466
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,190
 

1467
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:37,110
 what happens if in your training seeds

1468
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,110
 

1469
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:38,850
 you just have one training seat so you

1470
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,850
 

1471
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:40,530
 can have as many training trajectory as

1472
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,530
 

1473
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:42,390
 you want but you're only allowed to

1474
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,390
 

1475
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:44,910
 observe like one starting position and

1476
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,910
 

1477
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:46,320
 then there was a big gap right the line

1478
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,320
 

1479
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:48,240
 in green up here that's my

1480
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,240
 

1481
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,160
 generalization error so that's a big gap

1482
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:50,160
 

1483
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,320
 between what I think I'm gonna get when

1484
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:52,320
 

1485
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,720
 I train and what I actually get when I

1486
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:54,720
 

1487
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,360
 test so then we moved to two seeds and

1488
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:57,360
 

1489
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,040
 five seeds and as soon as we get to five

1490
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:59,040
 

1491
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,990
 or ten seeds essentially my

1492
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,990
 

1493
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:04,710
 generalization error completely

1494
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:04,710
 

1495
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:06,630
 disappear right so in a sense that's

1496
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,630
 

1497
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:09,450
 good right we want low generalization

1498
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:09,450
 

1499
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:12,810
 error that's really good it's a little

1500
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,810
 

1501
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:14,790
 bit worrisome that so few seeds allow

1502
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,790
 

1503
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:18,060
 you to essentially memorize the domain

1504
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:18,060
 

1505
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:20,670
 and when I asked some of my robotics

1506
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,670
 

1507
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:22,680
 colleague who I know have been working

1508
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,680
 

1509
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:25,650
 with a very similar set up in their work

1510
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:25,650
 

1511
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:29,130
 right they trained a robot to do this I

1512
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:29,130
 

1513
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:30,840
 asked them you know no jus five initial

1514
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,840
 

1515
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:34,320
 positions surely that was enough for

1516
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:34,320
 

1517
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:37,110
 your robot right it turns out not it

1518
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:37,110
 

1519
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,580
 turns out the real world is not quite so

1520
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,580
 

1521
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:42,510
 predictable in fact has a lot more

1522
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:42,510
 

1523
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:45,060
 variability than our simulators like the

1524
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,060
 

1525
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:47,400
 real world has incredible complexity and

1526
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:47,400
 

1527
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:51,210
 when we go to these simulators that

1528
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:51,210
 

1529
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:53,370
 complexity is completely lost standard

1530
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,370
 

1531
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:55,110
 robotic sensors like a bumblebee camera

1532
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,110
 

1533
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:57,720
 is gonna have like maybe 10 million

1534
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,720
 

1535
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:59,340
 bytes of data coming in every second the

1536
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:59,340
 

1537
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,780
 natural world needs on the order of

1538
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:01,780
 

1539
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:05,109
 zettabytes to be described

1540
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:05,109
 

1541
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:09,820
 and yet we're running with our L

1542
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:09,820
 

1543
00:37:05,109 --> 00:37:12,340
 benchmark that have a simplicity the

1544
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:12,340
 

1545
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:14,140
 Mojo codomain is very low state space le

1546
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,140
 

1547
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:16,330
 has a lot of different games but very

1548
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:16,330
 

1549
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:18,460
 small number of actions both cases

1550
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,460
 

1551
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:20,500
 mostly deterministic transitions reward

1552
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:20,500
 

1553
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:22,750
 if you actually look at the code to

1554
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:22,750
 

1555
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:24,160
 write some of these right the code is on

1556
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,160
 

1557
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:26,050
 the order of like a hundred kilobyte you

1558
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:26,050
 

1559
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,630
 can essentially describe the whole world

1560
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,630
 

1561
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:29,470
 with hundred kilobytes compared to the

1562
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,470
 

1563
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:32,830
 natural world

1564
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:32,830
 

1565
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:35,590
 this is ages apart and so as we move on

1566
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,590
 

1567
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:37,390
 the spectrum of generalization one of

1568
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,390
 

1569
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:40,119
 the things we have to do is really break

1570
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,119
 

1571
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:44,290
 out of these simulators and find a way

1572
00:37:40,109 --> 00:37:44,290
 

1573
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:46,630
 to tackle RL in the natural world now I

1574
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,630
 

1575
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:49,450
 realize it's a little bit difficult for

1576
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,450
 

1577
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:51,369
 all of the RL researchers to have access

1578
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,369
 

1579
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:53,560
 to labs to do neuro stimulation and

1580
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,560
 

1581
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:56,650
 robots to run experiments and one thing

1582
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:56,650
 

1583
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:59,410
 I love about the simulators is the fact

1584
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,410
 

1585
00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:01,030
 that they help reproducibility I can run

1586
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,030
 

1587
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:02,770
 my algorithms on something you can do

1588
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,770
 

1589
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:05,170
 the same we can compare a result in a

1590
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,170
 

1591
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:07,270
 very fluid way so we wanted to find a

1592
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,270
 

1593
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:09,670
 mechanism to keep the convenience of the

1594
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,670
 

1595
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:11,710
 simulator but do it in a way that we can

1596
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,710
 

1597
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:13,780
 actually include some of the complexity

1598
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,780
 

1599
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:15,400
 of the real world so we started

1600
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:15,400
 

1601
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:17,050
 brainstorming about this and the first

1602
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:17,050
 

1603
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:19,540
 thing we came up with is this cute

1604
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,540
 

1605
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:22,330
 little task where we take an image and

1606
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:22,330
 

1607
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:24,609
 we turn it into an RL simulation so take

1608
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,609
 

1609
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:27,250
 an image any image and the goal of the

1610
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:27,250
 

1611
00:38:24,609 --> 00:38:30,099
 agent is going to be to run around the

1612
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,099
 

1613
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:31,780
 world and as it runs around it acquires

1614
00:38:30,089 --> 00:38:31,780
 

1615
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:34,660
 more and more information about the

1616
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:34,660
 

1617
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:36,940
 image so the state is the image at

1618
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,940
 

1619
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:39,010
 anytime in point the RL actions are to

1620
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:39,010
 

1621
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:42,570
 move in the four cardinal directions and

1622
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,570
 

1623
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:46,839
 at some point the agent has to declare

1624
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,839
 

1625
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:50,050
 victory it has found this is a lanten a

1626
00:38:46,829 --> 00:38:50,050
 

1627
00:38:46,839 --> 00:38:52,960
 camera and if it gets the right guess it

1628
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,960
 

1629
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:55,000
 gets the reward and so very convenient

1630
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:55,000
 

1631
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,070
 because these images are taken from the

1632
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:57,070
 

1633
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,500
 real world they have the natural noise

1634
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,500
 

1635
00:38:57,070 --> 00:39:02,260
 that I'm seeking they embedded into an

1636
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:02,260
 

1637
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:04,150
 RL system and they do so in a way that I

1638
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,150
 

1639
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:06,070
 can share all I have to do is send an

1640
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,070
 

1641
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:08,589
 image to someone and we can run on the

1642
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,589
 

1643
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:10,570
 same RL domain a little bit simplistic

1644
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,570
 

1645
00:39:08,589 --> 00:39:12,400
 in terms of dynamics and actions but at

1646
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,400
 

1647
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:14,820
 least on the observation side I have

1648
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:14,820
 

1649
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:17,370
 wonderful variability

1650
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,370
 

1651
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:18,870
 and when I do this on the CFR 10 dataset

1652
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,870
 

1653
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:22,200
 where have a lot of images and I used

1654
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:22,200
 

1655
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:23,610
 the standard Train test split so all of

1656
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,610
 

1657
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,800
 the training images can be used as

1658
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,800
 

1659
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:27,510
 simulation environments for training all

1660
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:27,510
 

1661
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,460
 of the testing images are used for

1662
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,460
 

1663
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:31,860
 testing now if I look at my

1664
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,860
 

1665
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:33,690
 generalization gap I see that to get my

1666
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:33,690
 

1667
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:35,790
 generalization error all the way down I

1668
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,790
 

1669
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:39,300
 need on the order of 10,000 training

1670
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:39,300
 

1671
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:41,970
 seeds and so that's a lot more healthy

1672
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:41,970
 

1673
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:44,370
 in terms of variability I think we did

1674
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,370
 

1675
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:46,620
 this not only for CFR 10 we also did it

1676
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,620
 

1677
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:49,560
 for EM nough sweded it for C for 100 and

1678
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:49,560
 

1679
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:51,840
 what you also start to see if you train

1680
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:51,840
 

1681
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:54,150
 different RL agents in the three graphs

1682
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:54,150
 

1683
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:55,890
 below I have three different RL agents

1684
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,890
 

1685
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:58,830
 that we've trained you start to see nice

1686
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,830
 

1687
00:39:55,890 --> 00:40:00,870
 separation in the very easy M nest task

1688
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,870
 

1689
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:02,550
 um the blue and the green algorithm

1690
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,550
 

1691
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:05,250
 actually neck-and-neck for performance

1692
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:05,250
 

1693
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:06,990
 as you move to see far ten green really

1694
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,990
 

1695
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:09,420
 starts to pull ahead as you move to see

1696
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,420
 

1697
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:11,730
 far a hundred green has a nice big

1698
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:11,730
 

1699
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:13,680
 separation and so there seems to be also

1700
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,680
 

1701
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:15,240
 some discriminating power in terms of

1702
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:15,240
 

1703
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:19,200
 comparing algorithms for this task

1704
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:19,200
 

1705
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:21,690
 despite the simple dynamics static

1706
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:21,690
 

1707
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:24,240
 images are nice but they don't require a

1708
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,240
 

1709
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:26,430
 lot of strategy and you could probably

1710
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:26,430
 

1711
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:28,140
 make the argument that with a good you

1712
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,140
 

1713
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:30,210
 know information-gathering heuristic you

1714
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:30,210
 

1715
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:32,010
 could get a policy that doesn't need you

1716
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,010
 

1717
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:34,200
 know PPO or something like that to be

1718
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,200
 

1719
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:37,740
 trained and so we started looking at a

1720
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:37,740
 

1721
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:40,490
 second strategy for doing this in this

1722
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:40,490
 

1723
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:44,340
 case we looked at the atari domains

1724
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,340
 

1725
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:46,560
 realize that many of them had a very

1726
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:46,560
 

1727
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:48,540
 simple background black background in

1728
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:48,540
 

1729
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,190
 this case the game called breakout right

1730
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:50,190
 

1731
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:51,780
 you control the little palette at the

1732
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,780
 

1733
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:53,760
 bottom you if you hit the ball and it

1734
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:53,760
 

1735
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:56,580
 touches a brick you get some points and

1736
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:56,580
 

1737
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,460
 we thought what if what if we could make

1738
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:59,460
 

1739
00:40:56,580 --> 00:41:02,700
 this a lot more interesting with natural

1740
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:02,700
 

1741
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:05,040
 world signal and so we spent some time

1742
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:05,040
 

1743
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:08,720
 taking atari games and instead of a

1744
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:08,720
 

1745
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:12,540
 black background we pipe in some video

1746
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:12,540
 

1747
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:16,260
 videos from the real world videos an

1748
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:16,260
 

1749
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:18,330
 endless source of natural noise and the

1750
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,330
 

1751
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:20,340
 beautiful thing about video is I can use

1752
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,340
 

1753
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:22,200
 some videos for training I can use some

1754
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:22,200
 

1755
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:24,300
 videos for testing and if I want a

1756
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:24,300
 

1757
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:27,840
 completely new test set next year I just

1758
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:27,840
 

1759
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:28,620
 grab some new videos in in doing so as

1760
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:28,620
 

1761
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,660
 long as I have a

1762
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:30,660
 

1763
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:32,880
 process for grabbing videos I can have a

1764
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:32,880
 

1765
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:35,880
 simulator that I can share that we can

1766
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:35,880
 

1767
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:38,040
 all use we can have as much data as we

1768
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:38,040
 

1769
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:40,590
 want the strategy aspects are still

1770
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:40,590
 

1771
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:42,300
 respected in this case we asked ashumen

1772
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,300
 

1773
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:44,340
 we haven't yet trained the RL agent for

1774
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:44,340
 

1775
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:46,170
 this I invite you all to try it out we

1776
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:46,170
 

1777
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:47,520
 asked a human to play the game and we

1778
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,520
 

1779
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,200
 show that though the game is a little

1780
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:49,200
 

1781
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,360
 bit harder for the human they can still

1782
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:51,360
 

1783
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:53,250
 play there's a little bit of distraction

1784
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:53,250
 

1785
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:56,340
 from the background but it's still a

1786
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:56,340
 

1787
00:41:53,250 --> 00:42:00,510
 doable game and we have easy replication

1788
00:41:56,330 --> 00:42:00,510
 

1789
00:41:56,340 --> 00:42:03,930
 and comparison in this move from static

1790
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:03,930
 

1791
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:06,120
 images to video background I think

1792
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,120
 

1793
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:08,670
 there's a lot further we can go as a

1794
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:08,670
 

1795
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:10,170
 community one of the things that has

1796
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,170
 

1797
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:12,630
 been investigated by some of my

1798
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,630
 

1799
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:14,850
 colleagues at Facebook is actually the

1800
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,850
 

1801
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:17,340
 creation of simulation environments that

1802
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,340
 

1803
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:20,520
 are completely photorealistic but have

1804
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:20,520
 

1805
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:22,830
 full properties of simulators so in this

1806
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:22,830
 

1807
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:25,770
 case the simulator is essentially an

1808
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:25,770
 

1809
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:28,080
 emulator built from images videos that

1810
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,080
 

1811
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:29,760
 were taken from real homes thousands of

1812
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:29,760
 

1813
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:31,920
 real homes you can have nice separation

1814
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:31,920
 

1815
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:34,260
 again with training and testing you can

1816
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:34,260
 

1817
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:36,840
 actually set tasks like get the ball

1818
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:36,840
 

1819
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:38,610
 find my keys if you look at this one

1820
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:38,610
 

1821
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,050
 there's particularly nice effects

1822
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,050
 

1823
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:42,300
 through the mirrors which some of the

1824
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,300
 

1825
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:44,430
 colleagues at Facebook reality labs have

1826
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:44,430
 

1827
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:46,710
 been working on and it gives you a

1828
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,710
 

1829
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:54,060
 really high variability of different

1830
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:54,060
 

1831
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:56,190
 domains so going back to this do we

1832
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:56,190
 

1833
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:58,530
 really have to train and test on the

1834
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:58,530
 

1835
00:42:56,190 --> 00:43:01,500
 same task I would argue that we really

1836
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,500
 

1837
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:04,500
 don't add a minimum we can start by

1838
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:04,500
 

1839
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:05,820
 using different random seeds it turns

1840
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:05,820
 

1841
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,140
 out that not a lot of seeds are

1842
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:07,140
 

1843
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:09,650
 necessary with our current simulation

1844
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:09,650
 

1845
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:11,970
 environment there's a lot we can do to

1846
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,970
 

1847
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:13,410
 incorporate natural noise in the

1848
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,410
 

1849
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:15,690
 environment whether through image

1850
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,690
 

1851
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:18,180
 through video and eventually through

1852
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,180
 

1853
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:20,400
 photorealistic simulators I encourage

1854
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:20,400
 

1855
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:22,800
 you to explore that full spectrum

1856
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:22,800
 

1857
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,720
 I think simulation and the ability to

1858
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:24,720
 

1859
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,970
 share environment is great but I think

1860
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:26,970
 

1861
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:29,340
 really we can set the bar much higher in

1862
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,340
 

1863
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:33,600
 terms of the realism of our simulators

1864
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:33,600
 

1865
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:35,640
 and should you once in a while want to

1866
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:35,640
 

1867
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:38,130
 tackle a real-world problem I do

1868
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:38,130
 

1869
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:40,290
 encourage all of you on a regular basis

1870
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,290
 

1871
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:42,180
 to step out into the real world and

1872
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,180
 

1873
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:44,849
 tackle a real problem

1874
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:44,849
 

1875
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:47,430
 one where you might not control how data

1876
00:43:44,839 --> 00:43:47,430
 

1877
00:43:44,849 --> 00:43:49,890
 is acquired we worry a lot about

1878
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:49,890
 

1879
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:52,200
 exploration policy and solving the

1880
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,200
 

1881
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:54,630
 exploration problem in my experience

1882
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:54,630
 

1883
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:57,119
 solving real world problem I never got

1884
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:57,119
 

1885
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:58,920
 into the project early enough or rarely

1886
00:43:57,109 --> 00:43:58,920
 

1887
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:00,750
 did I get in the project early enough

1888
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:00,750
 

1889
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:02,700
 that I couldn't control exploration most

1890
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:02,700
 

1891
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:05,520
 of the time I'm given data collected by

1892
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:05,520
 

1893
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:07,020
 some strategy if I'm lucky there's a

1894
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:07,020
 

1895
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:09,180
 little bit of randomization in my

1896
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:09,180
 

1897
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:11,099
 strategy and I'm given the task of

1898
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:11,099
 

1899
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:13,859
 learning the best policy I can and then

1900
00:44:11,089 --> 00:44:13,859
 

1901
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:16,289
 testing that policy when we did the

1902
00:44:13,849 --> 00:44:16,289
 

1903
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:19,049
 neurostimulation project and we got the

1904
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:19,049
 

1905
00:44:16,289 --> 00:44:20,460
 data not controlling this strategy it

1906
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:20,460
 

1907
00:44:19,049 --> 00:44:22,529
 had been collected with a fixed

1908
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:22,529
 

1909
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:24,750
 simulation policy we spent six months

1910
00:44:22,519 --> 00:44:24,750
 

1911
00:44:22,529 --> 00:44:26,730
 eight months learning the best policy we

1912
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:26,730
 

1913
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:29,940
 could some point we were ready we had

1914
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,940
 

1915
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:31,770
 this PI star our optimal policy we went

1916
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:31,770
 

1917
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:33,900
 back into the lab and we were not

1918
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,900
 

1919
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:37,859
 allowed any online learning we deployed

1920
00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:37,859
 

1921
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:39,900
 the strategy it took two years to just

1922
00:44:37,849 --> 00:44:39,900
 

1923
00:44:37,859 --> 00:44:42,029
 do the policy evaluation get enough

1924
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:42,029
 

1925
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:44,880
 animals so that we could get significant

1926
00:44:42,019 --> 00:44:44,880
 

1927
00:44:42,029 --> 00:44:46,650
 results in terms of showing that the

1928
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:46,650
 

1929
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:49,440
 optimal policy was better than the

1930
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,440
 

1931
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:51,150
 current standard in the literature so

1932
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:51,150
 

1933
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,950
 you have to be patient if you want to do

1934
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:52,950
 

1935
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:54,569
 real-world but in doing so we learned a

1936
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,569
 

1937
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:56,849
 ton about what were realistic

1938
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:56,849
 

1939
00:44:54,569 --> 00:44:58,829
 assumptions what kind of methods worked

1940
00:44:56,839 --> 00:44:58,829
 

1941
00:44:56,849 --> 00:45:01,079
 under these conditions and it has

1942
00:44:58,819 --> 00:45:01,079
 

1943
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:05,369
 inspired since then a lot of our more

1944
00:45:01,069 --> 00:45:05,369
 

1945
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:07,140
 recent work so I've given I've been

1946
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:07,140
 

1947
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:08,849
 given this really amazing opportunity to

1948
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:08,849
 

1949
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:11,609
 speak to you this morning it's really

1950
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:11,609
 

1951
00:45:08,849 --> 00:45:14,369
 been an honor but I do come with you

1952
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:14,369
 

1953
00:45:11,609 --> 00:45:17,760
 with a few messages the first one is

1954
00:45:14,359 --> 00:45:17,760
 

1955
00:45:14,369 --> 00:45:21,390
 really to let go of this notion that

1956
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:21,390
 

1957
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:23,520
 science is a competitive sport science

1958
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:23,520
 

1959
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:25,890
 is a collaborative process it's a

1960
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:25,890
 

1961
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,750
 collective institution and it's through

1962
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,750
 

1963
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:29,819
 sharing of our results and sharing of

1964
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:29,819
 

1965
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:31,260
 our methods that we are going to do

1966
00:45:29,809 --> 00:45:31,260
 

1967
00:45:29,819 --> 00:45:33,270
 better science and that we are going to

1968
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:33,270
 

1969
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:37,049
 have a better ability to understand and

1970
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:37,049
 

1971
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:39,119
 have a positive impact on our world in

1972
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:39,119
 

1973
00:45:37,049 --> 00:45:40,770
 some cases you know consider using our

1974
00:45:39,109 --> 00:45:40,770
 

1975
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:42,510
 checklist we will make it available for

1976
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,510
 

1977
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:45,059
 anyone who wants to do the checklist

1978
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:45,059
 

1979
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:47,039
 isn't really meant as a safeguard

1980
00:45:45,049 --> 00:45:47,039
 

1981
00:45:45,059 --> 00:45:49,890
 towards letting papers and it's really

1982
00:45:47,029 --> 00:45:49,890
 

1983
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:51,390
 meant as a reminder to each of us of

1984
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,390
 

1985
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:54,089
 what we should be looking for in terms

1986
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:54,089
 

1987
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:55,589
 of good science in our own work and in

1988
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:55,589
 

1989
00:45:54,089 --> 00:46:00,089
 the work of others when we do read

1990
00:45:55,579 --> 00:46:00,089
 

1991
00:45:55,589 --> 00:46:02,249
 Euan should you feel like you want to

1992
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:02,249
 

1993
00:46:00,089 --> 00:46:04,349
 contribute to this work this effort

1994
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:04,349
 

1995
00:46:02,249 --> 00:46:06,630
 towards reproducibility and better

1996
00:46:04,339 --> 00:46:06,630
 

1997
00:46:04,349 --> 00:46:08,549
 science we have launched the iclear

1998
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:08,549
 

1999
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:10,200
 reproducibility challenge we are now in

2000
00:46:08,539 --> 00:46:10,200
 

2001
00:46:08,549 --> 00:46:12,539
 the second year of the challenge it's

2002
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:12,539
 

2003
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:15,329
 still not too late the goal is to get

2004
00:46:12,529 --> 00:46:15,329
 

2005
00:46:12,539 --> 00:46:17,400
 members of the community to take on the

2006
00:46:15,319 --> 00:46:17,400
 

2007
00:46:15,329 --> 00:46:19,229
 task of reproducing the empirical

2008
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:19,229
 

2009
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:21,299
 results in one of the iclear submissions

2010
00:46:19,219 --> 00:46:21,299
 

2011
00:46:19,229 --> 00:46:23,670
 the use of open review makes it very

2012
00:46:21,289 --> 00:46:23,670
 

2013
00:46:21,299 --> 00:46:25,769
 easy to have access to the work early on

2014
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:25,769
 

2015
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:28,109
 but also to communicate back to the

2016
00:46:25,759 --> 00:46:28,109
 

2017
00:46:25,769 --> 00:46:31,049
 authors the results of your findings

2018
00:46:28,099 --> 00:46:31,049
 

2019
00:46:28,109 --> 00:46:33,539
 when we did this challenge last year

2020
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:33,539
 

2021
00:46:31,049 --> 00:46:36,329
 after the fact we asked authors who had

2022
00:46:33,529 --> 00:46:36,329
 

2023
00:46:33,539 --> 00:46:38,460
 received reproducibility reports whether

2024
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:38,460
 

2025
00:46:36,329 --> 00:46:41,069
 they appreciated it how many of them

2026
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:41,069
 

2027
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:43,469
 change their paper as a result of that

2028
00:46:41,059 --> 00:46:43,469
 

2029
00:46:41,069 --> 00:46:45,119
 feedback 80% of them said they changed

2030
00:46:43,459 --> 00:46:45,119
 

2031
00:46:43,469 --> 00:46:47,430
 their paper as a result of that feedback

2032
00:46:45,109 --> 00:46:47,430
 

2033
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:49,200
 we also asked them what you want to your

2034
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:49,200
 

2035
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:52,319
 paper to enter the reproducibility

2036
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:52,319
 

2037
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:54,749
 challenge next year 80% of them said yes

2038
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:54,749
 

2039
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:56,729
 right now we have 31 institutions

2040
00:46:54,739 --> 00:46:56,729
 

2041
00:46:54,749 --> 00:46:59,069
 participating about a hundred papers are

2042
00:46:56,719 --> 00:46:59,069
 

2043
00:46:56,729 --> 00:47:01,469
 being replicated but there are many many

2044
00:46:59,059 --> 00:47:01,469
 

2045
00:46:59,069 --> 00:47:03,150
 more submissions at iclear and we have a

2046
00:47:01,459 --> 00:47:03,150
 

2047
00:47:01,469 --> 00:47:04,680
 mechanism through github to ensure that

2048
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:04,680
 

2049
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:07,019
 you're claiming a paper that hasn't been

2050
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:07,019
 

2051
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:10,619
 reproduced by another team so if after

2052
00:47:07,009 --> 00:47:10,619
 

2053
00:47:07,019 --> 00:47:13,200
 nips you have nothing else to do and you

2054
00:47:10,609 --> 00:47:13,200
 

2055
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:14,579
 need a break from your own science and

2056
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:14,579
 

2057
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:17,609
 you want to help someone else the

2058
00:47:14,569 --> 00:47:17,609
 

2059
00:47:14,579 --> 00:47:21,269
 science and the community please jump in

2060
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:21,269
 

2061
00:47:17,609 --> 00:47:23,940
 do your share if you feel like after

2062
00:47:21,259 --> 00:47:23,940
 

2063
00:47:21,269 --> 00:47:25,259
 today you either don't know anything

2064
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:25,259
 

2065
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:26,940
 about reinforcement learning or want to

2066
00:47:25,249 --> 00:47:26,940
 

2067
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:29,579
 learn a little bit more I'm delighted to

2068
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:29,579
 

2069
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:31,259
 say we have a monograph appearing this

2070
00:47:29,569 --> 00:47:31,259
 

2071
00:47:29,579 --> 00:47:32,999

2073
00:47:31,259 --> 00:47:35,400
 machine learning I encourage you to read

2074
00:47:32,989 --> 00:47:35,400
 

2075
00:47:32,999 --> 00:47:36,869
 it and it contains a chapter with some

2076
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:36,869
 

2077
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:39,420

2079
00:47:36,869 --> 00:47:41,279
 discussed today though not all as I

2080
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:41,279
 

2081
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:43,769

2095
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:58,650
 the work on natural RL and I continue to

00:47:57,019 --> 00:47:58,650
 

2097
00:47:57,029 --> 00:48:01,349
 be supported and inspired by my labs

2099
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:02,540
 both at McGill and at fair thank you

2100
00:48:01,339 --> 00:48:02,540
 

2101
00:48:01,349 --> 00:48:16,750
 very much

2102
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:16,750
 

2103
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:21,440
[Applause]

2104
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:21,440
 

2105
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:23,810
 yeah so I mean I'm a dietician and I'm

2106
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:23,810
 

2107
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:25,010
 listening to it who is some kind of

2108
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,010
 

2109
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:30,260
 puzzlement

2110
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:30,260
 

2111
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:32,330
 because for me trust in results comes

2112
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:32,330
 

2113
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:34,640
 from truths for mathematical proofs and

2114
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,640
 

2115
00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:37,130
 you didn't you hardly ever mentioned it

2116
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:37,130
 

2117
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:40,460
 I mean it's like we are in the early

2118
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:40,460
 

2119
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:45,460
 ages where we all we can do is probably

2120
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:45,460
 

2121
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:49,910
 our experiments what about more you know

2122
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:49,910
 

2123
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:52,120
 provable guarantees or limit to verbal

2124
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:52,120
 

2125
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:56,570
 limitations

2126
00:48:52,110 --> 00:48:56,570
 

2127
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:58,400
 mm-hmm I am all in favor of proofs and I

2128
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,400
 

2129
00:48:56,570 --> 00:49:00,620
 mentioned it maybe too briefly in the

2130
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:00,620
 

2131
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:03,110
 beginning I think the case can be made

2132
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:03,110
 

2133
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:05,930
 that we need much stronger results on

2134
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:05,930
 

2135
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:08,000
 the theoretical side the reality is in

2136
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,000
 

2137
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:10,100
 many fields of science including

2138
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:10,100
 

2139
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,440
 reinforcement learning there's a lag

2140
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:12,440
 

2141
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:14,570
 between what theory says and what

2142
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:14,570
 

2143
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:17,120
 empirical results say and so this is not

2144
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:17,120
 

2145
00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:20,300
 in any way a claim that we should only

2146
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:20,300
 

2147
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:22,520
 do empirical work this is simply a call

2148
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:22,520
 

2149
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:23,900
 that for anyone who does do empirical

2150
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:23,900
 

2151
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:26,630
 work and I think empirical work is

2152
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:26,630
 

2153
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:28,370
 important to do it well and then I'll

2154
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:28,370
 

2155
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:30,140
 leave it to others to tell us how to do

2156
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,140
 

2157
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:32,780
 the theoretical work well on a different

2158
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:32,780
 

2159
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:39,340
 day but absolutely I strongly support

2160
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:39,340
 

2161
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:41,810
 good theory thank you for great talk

2162
00:49:39,330 --> 00:49:41,810
 

2163
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:46,160
 just wondering whether you can comment

2164
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:46,160
 

2165
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:49,310
 on the fact that you know unlike a more

2166
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:49,310
 

2167
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:53,030
 artificial simulation environment in a

2168
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:53,030
 

2169
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:54,740
 not more of a natural type of input data

2170
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:54,740
 

2171
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:56,930
 you know it might be a little bit more

2172
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:56,930
 

2173
00:49:54,740 --> 00:50:00,290
 difficult to actually characterize those

2174
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:00,290
 

2175
00:49:56,930 --> 00:50:01,850
 data so I'm just wondering whether you

2176
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:01,850
 

2177
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:05,660
 have any comments on regarding the kind

2178
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:05,660
 

2179
00:50:01,850 --> 00:50:07,070
 of embedded bias things like that are

2180
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:07,070
 

2181
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:09,230
 you asking whether it may be more

2182
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:09,230
 

2183
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:10,790
 difficult to characterize natural data

2184
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:10,790
 

2185
00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:12,200
 when we pipe it in the trend the

2186
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:12,200
 

2187
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:14,360
 properties of that data on the

2188
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:14,360
 

2189
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:16,730
 distributions exactly yeah I think

2190
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:16,730
 

2191
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:19,070
 that's absolutely right definitely you

2192
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,070
 

2193
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:20,900
 know I showed this where we feed in this

2194
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:20,900
 

2195
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:22,820
 video in the background and it's

2196
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:22,820
 

2197
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:24,410
 possible that there's a lot of

2198
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:24,410
 

2199
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:25,140
 variability and the types of videos that

2200
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,140
 

2201
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:28,320
 get fed

2202
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:28,320
 

2203
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:30,330
 and in a sense when we do pure

2204
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:30,330
 

2205
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:31,950
 simulation we can control that a lot and

2206
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,950
 

2207
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:34,440
 in the examples I showed we don't

2208
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:34,440
 

2209
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:36,630
 control that at all and I think the

2210
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:36,630
 

2211
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:39,000
 level of control that we impose on that

2212
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:39,000
 

2213
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:40,890
 has to do with how we sample the natural

2214
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:40,890
 

2215
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,020
 world and so in some of the works or

2216
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,020
 

2217
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:45,450
 just sample images we're looking at one

2218
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:45,450
 

2219
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:47,550
 modality in a certain number of pixels

2220
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,550
 

2221
00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:50,220
 of the natural world and so that allows

2222
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:50,220
 

2223
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:52,320
 us to generalize within that space what

2224
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:52,320
 

2225
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:54,240
 I like about these ideas is it's really

2226
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:54,240
 

2227
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:56,190
 more a way of thinking I'm not being

2228
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:56,190
 

2229
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:58,290
 prescriptive completely about how you

2230
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:58,290
 

2231
00:50:56,190 --> 00:51:00,510
 should simulate the world I'm calling on

2232
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:00,510
 

2233
00:50:58,290 --> 00:51:02,670
 everyone to think of creative mechanisms

2234
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,670
 

2235
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:04,260
 to feed in natural world so if you have

2236
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:04,260
 

2237
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:06,810
 a method that you think is more adequate

2238
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:06,810
 

2239
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:08,310
 for relatively controlled variability

2240
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,310
 

2241
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:10,260
 there's a way to sample the natural

2242
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:10,260
 

2243
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:12,600
 world for that and if you really want to

2244
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:12,600
 

2245
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:14,430
 go all out then we're hoping to have

2246
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:14,430
 

2247
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:18,030
 some nice 3d simulation environments

2248
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:18,030
 

2249
00:51:14,430 --> 00:51:19,440
 built over the next few years as your

2250
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:19,440
 

2251
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:23,000
 nice talk

2252
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:23,000
 

2253
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:25,710
 one quick remark and then a question

2254
00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:25,710
 

2255
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,060
 with RL there's more than the machine

2256
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:27,060
 

2257
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:28,680
 learning component right in

2258
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:28,680
 

2259
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:30,360
 generalization there's also the planning

2260
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:30,360
 

2261
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:32,190
 component and I think if you take that

2262
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:32,190
 

2263
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:36,480
 perspective some of the current

2264
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:36,480
 

2265
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:38,790
 practices are not are not that bad but

2266
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:38,790
 

2267
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:42,480
 this is probably a requires a longer

2268
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:42,480
 

2269
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:45,000
 answer how do you square the idea of

2270
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:45,000
 

2271
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:46,920
 using a reproducibility checklist with

2272
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:46,920
 

2273
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,200
 the current conference culture that we

2274
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:49,200
 

2275
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:52,200
 have with the really short review cycle

2276
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:52,200
 

2277
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:54,330
 and just to be blunt the superficial

2278
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:54,330
 

2279
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:56,490
 review cycle that way that we currently

2280
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,490
 

2281
00:51:54,330 --> 00:51:59,220
 have I think what you said on the ICL

2282
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,220
 

2283
00:51:56,490 --> 00:52:00,390
 our side of things is a step in the

2284
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:00,390
 

2285
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:02,100
 right direction but you have anything

2286
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:02,100
 

2287
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:03,980
 more to say it's how we can change as a

2288
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:03,980
 

2289
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:08,130
 community to reflect those standards

2290
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:08,130
 

2291
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:10,110
 yeah I think in terms of you know you

2292
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:10,110
 

2293
00:52:08,130 --> 00:52:12,030
 make a very good point that RL is both

2294
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:12,030
 

2295
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:13,890
 the the learning and the planning and

2296
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:13,890
 

2297
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:15,510
 one of the things I'll be candid that

2298
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,510
 

2299
00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:17,310
 I'm really not satisfied with is our

2300
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,310
 

2301
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:19,170
 ability to have natural noise in terms

2302
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,170
 

2303
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:20,850
 of our control and our plans by the

2304
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,850
 

2305
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:22,590
 effects of the actions and so on are

2306
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,590
 

2307
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:26,520
 still very deterministic so if anyone

2308
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:26,520
 

2309
00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:29,010
 has ideas in terms of our ability to

2310
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:29,010
 

2311
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:30,690
 incorporate new practices with respect

2312
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,690
 

2313
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:33,330
 to publishing and submission and

2314
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,330
 

2315
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:36,390
 reviewing I'm quite hopeful that we can

2316
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:36,390
 

2317
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:37,619
 do that I think I've been pushing a lot

2318
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:37,619
 

2319
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:40,079
 in the last year

2320
00:52:37,609 --> 00:52:40,079
 

2321
00:52:37,619 --> 00:52:41,910
 to have mandatory code submission

2322
00:52:40,069 --> 00:52:41,910
 

2323
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:43,499
 mandatory data set inclusion in the

2324
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,499
 

2325
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:45,900
 papers and I've had some really good

2326
00:52:43,489 --> 00:52:45,900
 

2327
00:52:43,499 --> 00:52:47,190
 discussions with folks in in a sense you

2328
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:47,190
 

2329
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:49,259
 know the checklist may be a little bit

2330
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:49,259
 

2331
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:51,450
 backing away from that in that I'm not

2332
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:51,450
 

2333
00:52:49,259 --> 00:52:53,609
 requiring anything I'm just requiring

2334
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,609
 

2335
00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:56,519
 accountability so I'm asking the

2336
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:56,519
 

2337
00:52:53,609 --> 00:52:57,599
 author's to do an audit careful audit of

2338
00:52:56,509 --> 00:52:57,599
 

2339
00:52:56,519 --> 00:52:59,700
 whether they're putting in their paper

2340
00:52:57,589 --> 00:52:59,700
 

2341
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:01,289
 and answer this honestly and then I'm

2342
00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:01,289
 

2343
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:02,910
 allowing their so I'm suggesting we use

2344
00:53:01,279 --> 00:53:02,910
 

2345
00:53:01,289 --> 00:53:05,660
 these kinds of checklist that submission

2346
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:05,660
 

2347
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:08,220
 times the author feel them but then the

2348
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:08,220
 

2349
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:09,569
 then the reviewers can actually check

2350
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:09,569
 

2351
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:11,940
 whether what they saw in the paper

2352
00:53:09,559 --> 00:53:11,940
 

2353
00:53:09,569 --> 00:53:14,309
 matches what's on there and eventually I

2354
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:14,309
 

2355
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:15,420
 should have said I'm sorry I apologize I

2356
00:53:14,299 --> 00:53:15,420
 

2357
00:53:14,309 --> 00:53:17,400
 didn't say it but this checklist was

2358
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:17,400
 

2359
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:19,769
 actually inspired by a checklist that's

2360
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:19,769
 

2361
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:21,210
 been introduced in the journal Nature it

2362
00:53:19,759 --> 00:53:21,210
 

2363
00:53:19,769 --> 00:53:22,890
 looks very different because they're

2364
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,890
 

2365
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:24,299
 worried about different questions and

2366
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,299
 

2367
00:53:22,890 --> 00:53:26,490
 different equipments and different

2368
00:53:24,289 --> 00:53:26,490
 

2369
00:53:24,299 --> 00:53:28,049
 methods but the spirit is coming from

2370
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,049
 

2371
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:30,450
 there and in their case they make the

2372
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:30,450
 

2373
00:53:28,049 --> 00:53:31,980
 checklist public at publication time so

2374
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:31,980
 

2375
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:33,089
 that people who read a paper know what's

2376
00:53:31,970 --> 00:53:33,089
 

2377
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:34,529
 in there and know what they're in for

2378
00:53:33,079 --> 00:53:34,529
 

2379
00:53:33,089 --> 00:53:36,539
 they'll know if there's code and data

2380
00:53:34,519 --> 00:53:36,539
 

2381
00:53:34,529 --> 00:53:38,759
 set and so on and so having that

2382
00:53:36,529 --> 00:53:38,759
 

2383
00:53:36,539 --> 00:53:41,940
 accountability is what I'm trying to

2384
00:53:38,749 --> 00:53:41,940
 

2385
00:53:38,759 --> 00:53:44,400
 encourage here do you think we have to

2386
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:44,400
 

2387
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:46,529
 give reviewers the space and so on

2388
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:46,529
 

2389
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,779
 that's a pretty significant set of

2390
00:53:46,519 --> 00:53:48,779
 

2391
00:53:46,529 --> 00:53:50,579
 standards that you know if we want to

2392
00:53:48,769 --> 00:53:50,579
 

2393
00:53:48,779 --> 00:53:52,859
 enforce them as a community we've got to

2394
00:53:50,569 --> 00:53:52,859
 

2395
00:53:50,579 --> 00:53:56,069
 maybe rethink a little bit how we do

2396
00:53:52,849 --> 00:53:56,069
 

2397
00:53:52,859 --> 00:53:58,200
 reviewing absolutely thank you thank you

2398
00:53:56,059 --> 00:53:58,200
 

2399
00:53:56,069 --> 00:54:01,289
 for the fantastic talk I love the idea

2400
00:53:58,190 --> 00:54:01,289
 

2401
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:02,940
 of the video Atari benchmark I was

2402
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:02,940
 

2403
00:54:01,289 --> 00:54:05,489
 wondering in your experience and pushing

2404
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:05,489
 

2405
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:07,499
 towards real-world RL problems where to

2406
00:54:05,479 --> 00:54:07,499
 

2407
00:54:05,489 --> 00:54:09,720
 see the key challenges that we need to

2408
00:54:07,489 --> 00:54:09,720
 

2409
00:54:07,499 --> 00:54:12,239
 address so is it in the complexity of

2410
00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:12,239
 

2411
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:14,400
 the observations is it the complexity of

2412
00:54:12,229 --> 00:54:14,400
 

2413
00:54:12,239 --> 00:54:15,869
 the dynamics at the the revert structure

2414
00:54:14,390 --> 00:54:15,869
 

2415
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:19,019
 I'd be really curious to hear your

2416
00:54:15,859 --> 00:54:19,019
 

2417
00:54:15,869 --> 00:54:20,759
 thoughts on that so I think with the

2418
00:54:19,009 --> 00:54:20,759
 

2419
00:54:19,019 --> 00:54:23,099
 natural signal the type of natural

2420
00:54:20,749 --> 00:54:23,099
 

2421
00:54:20,759 --> 00:54:24,839
 signal we've put in we really touch on

2422
00:54:23,089 --> 00:54:24,839
 

2423
00:54:23,099 --> 00:54:28,619
 the nerve of like the complexity of the

2424
00:54:24,829 --> 00:54:28,619
 

2425
00:54:24,839 --> 00:54:30,329
 observation space and in a sense that's

2426
00:54:28,609 --> 00:54:30,329
 

2427
00:54:28,619 --> 00:54:32,099
 an easier one to tackle because we've

2428
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:32,099
 

2429
00:54:30,329 --> 00:54:35,970
 had fantastic progress on deep learning

2430
00:54:32,089 --> 00:54:35,970
 

2431
00:54:32,099 --> 00:54:39,089
 that enables us to deal with that it's

2432
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:39,089
 

2433
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:41,670
 still really hard NRL to handle you know

2434
00:54:39,079 --> 00:54:41,670
 

2435
00:54:39,089 --> 00:54:44,220
 the very long planning sequences with

2436
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:44,220
 

2437
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:46,829
 the very sparse rewards and this doesn't

2438
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:46,829
 

2439
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:48,539
 really tackle that yet and so I think

2440
00:54:46,819 --> 00:54:48,539
 

2441
00:54:46,829 --> 00:54:50,789
 we're in the next year we're gonna be

2442
00:54:48,529 --> 00:54:50,789
 

2443
00:54:48,539 --> 00:54:52,650
 looking for ideas of how to do that but

2444
00:54:50,779 --> 00:54:52,650
 

2445
00:54:50,789 --> 00:54:54,059
 a mode that still preserves the ability

2446
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,059
 

2447
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:57,890
 to get lots of data and to share

2448
00:54:54,049 --> 00:54:57,890
 

2449
00:54:54,059 --> 00:54:57,890
 environments and to reproduce results

2450
00:54:58,749 --> 00:54:58,749
 

2451
00:54:58,759 --> 00:55:04,650
 good morning thank you for the great

2452
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:04,650
 

2453
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:06,959
 talk so listening to your talk and

2454
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,959
 

2455
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:09,719
 listening to a previous talk on Monday

2456
00:55:06,949 --> 00:55:09,719
 

2457
00:55:06,959 --> 00:55:12,869
 morning on adversarially robust machine

2458
00:55:09,709 --> 00:55:12,869
 

2459
00:55:09,719 --> 00:55:15,390
 learning I see this community grappling

2460
00:55:12,859 --> 00:55:15,390
 

2461
00:55:12,869 --> 00:55:18,689
 with a lot of problems and finding

2462
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:18,689
 

2463
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:20,969
 solutions that a different community has

2464
00:55:18,679 --> 00:55:20,969
 

2465
00:55:18,689 --> 00:55:22,709
 already grappled with and solved to some

2466
00:55:20,959 --> 00:55:22,709
 

2467
00:55:20,969 --> 00:55:26,189
 extent and that's the community I come

2468
00:55:22,699 --> 00:55:26,189
 

2469
00:55:22,709 --> 00:55:28,199
 from the control theory community so I'm

2470
00:55:26,179 --> 00:55:28,199
 

2471
00:55:26,189 --> 00:55:29,939
 wondering if you have thoughts on the

2472
00:55:28,189 --> 00:55:29,939
 

2473
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:32,549
 way to bring these two communities

2474
00:55:29,929 --> 00:55:32,549
 

2475
00:55:29,939 --> 00:55:35,789
 together for what I think would be good

2476
00:55:32,539 --> 00:55:35,789
 

2477
00:55:32,549 --> 00:55:37,829
 for all basically especially on the

2478
00:55:35,779 --> 00:55:37,829
 

2479
00:55:35,789 --> 00:55:39,900
 aspect of robustness I think the control

2480
00:55:37,819 --> 00:55:39,900
 

2481
00:55:37,829 --> 00:55:42,029
 community has done a lot and there's

2482
00:55:39,890 --> 00:55:42,029
 

2483
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:45,119
 some members of the RAL community that

2484
00:55:42,019 --> 00:55:45,119
 

2485
00:55:42,029 --> 00:55:47,640
 do have a foot in each and help us

2486
00:55:45,109 --> 00:55:47,640
 

2487
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:49,890
 bridge some of these ideas I would say

2488
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:49,890
 

2489
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:50,969
 there's a there's a conference our ldm

2490
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:50,969
 

2491
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:52,949
 the reinforcement learning and

2492
00:55:50,959 --> 00:55:52,949
 

2493
00:55:50,969 --> 00:55:55,589
 decision-making conference that really

2494
00:55:52,939 --> 00:55:55,589
 

2495
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:58,079
 tries to take RL from a much broader

2496
00:55:55,579 --> 00:55:58,079
 

2497
00:55:55,589 --> 00:56:00,659
 perspective and welcomes people from

2498
00:55:58,069 --> 00:56:00,659
 

2499
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:02,880
 control from neuroscience from economics

2500
00:56:00,649 --> 00:56:02,880
 

2501
00:56:00,659 --> 00:56:05,339
 and so on and get together I mean so

2502
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:05,339
 

2503
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:07,650
 that's one forum we have for exploring

2504
00:56:05,329 --> 00:56:07,650
 

2505
00:56:05,339 --> 00:56:13,380
 the much wider set of ideas and trying

2506
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:13,380
 

2507
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:16,799
 to build bridges thank you for this

2508
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:16,799
 

2509
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:19,169
 great talk my question is as a

2510
00:56:16,789 --> 00:56:19,169
 

2511
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:21,900
 supervisor how do you guarantee that

2512
00:56:19,159 --> 00:56:21,900
 

2513
00:56:19,169 --> 00:56:24,479
 your students replicated an algorithm

2514
00:56:21,890 --> 00:56:24,479
 

2515
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:26,999
 correctly before putting it in a

2516
00:56:24,469 --> 00:56:26,999
 

2517
00:56:24,479 --> 00:56:29,839
 baseline as just as a simple example

2518
00:56:26,989 --> 00:56:29,839
 

2519
00:56:26,999 --> 00:56:32,400
 recently in cvpr there was a publication

2520
00:56:29,829 --> 00:56:32,400
 

2521
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:34,799
 that went out and the whole testing

2522
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:34,799
 

2523
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:36,569
 procedure was flawed in the code and it

2524
00:56:34,789 --> 00:56:36,569
 

2525
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:39,179
 was discovered later and called out on

2526
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:39,179
 

2527
00:56:36,569 --> 00:56:41,849
 Reddit basically so that was not

2528
00:56:39,169 --> 00:56:41,849
 

2529
00:56:39,179 --> 00:56:43,589
 discovered during the supervisor review

2530
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:43,589
 

2531
00:56:41,849 --> 00:56:44,519
 process not discovered during the cvpr

2532
00:56:43,579 --> 00:56:44,519
 

2533
00:56:43,589 --> 00:56:48,569
 review process

2534
00:56:44,509 --> 00:56:48,569
 

2535
00:56:44,519 --> 00:56:50,519
 how can this problem be remedied in

2536
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:50,519
 

2537
00:56:48,569 --> 00:56:52,349
 relation to reinforcement learning for

2538
00:56:50,509 --> 00:56:52,349
 

2539
00:56:50,519 --> 00:56:54,509
 example where it's much more difficult

2540
00:56:52,339 --> 00:56:54,509
 

2541
00:56:52,349 --> 00:56:55,900
 than standard machine learning to

2542
00:56:54,499 --> 00:56:55,900
 

2543
00:56:54,509 --> 00:56:57,730
 quantify

2544
00:56:55,890 --> 00:56:57,730
 

2545
00:56:55,900 --> 00:57:00,279
 I think there's there's no perfect

2546
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:00,279
 

2547
00:56:57,730 --> 00:57:02,710
 solution there right it really it's

2548
00:57:00,269 --> 00:57:02,710
 

2549
00:57:00,279 --> 00:57:05,349
 about making very clear to the students

2550
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:05,349
 

2551
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:08,200
 on a daily basis that good science is

2552
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:08,200
 

2553
00:57:05,349 --> 00:57:10,539
 better than just pumping out the papers

2554
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:10,539
 

2555
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:13,109
 and understanding really we're always

2556
00:57:10,529 --> 00:57:13,109
 

2557
00:57:10,539 --> 00:57:15,819
 after understanding what is going on

2558
00:57:13,099 --> 00:57:15,819
 

2559
00:57:13,109 --> 00:57:17,319
 this particular work came out of my

2560
00:57:15,809 --> 00:57:17,319
 

2561
00:57:15,819 --> 00:57:19,059
 students trying to implement baselines

2562
00:57:17,309 --> 00:57:19,059
 

2563
00:57:17,319 --> 00:57:21,789
 and being quite frustrated by the

2564
00:57:19,049 --> 00:57:21,789
 

2565
00:57:19,059 --> 00:57:23,680
 results one thing that's also important

2566
00:57:21,779 --> 00:57:23,680
 

2567
00:57:21,789 --> 00:57:26,829
 to keep in mind is you know ask a lot of

2568
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:26,829
 

2569
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:28,960
 questions and question the good results

2570
00:57:26,819 --> 00:57:28,960
 

2571
00:57:26,829 --> 00:57:31,150
 as much as the bad results sometimes the

2572
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:31,150
 

2573
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:33,279
 result seems a little too good really

2574
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:33,279
 

2575
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:35,890
 question how the method was done why

2576
00:57:33,269 --> 00:57:35,890
 

2577
00:57:33,279 --> 00:57:38,049
 suddenly did we get a X percent

2578
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:38,049
 

2579
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:40,960
 improvement what was it and make sure we

2580
00:57:38,039 --> 00:57:40,960
 

2581
00:57:38,049 --> 00:57:42,760
 understand what's going on and in some

2582
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:42,760
 

2583
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:47,190
 cases you know pair students up together

2584
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:47,190
 

2585
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:49,990
 and ask them to work together thank you

2586
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:49,990
 

2587
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:52,119
 thank you for the great talk I think

2588
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:52,119
 

2589
00:57:49,990 --> 00:57:54,640
 it's very useful that you aspire to our

2590
00:57:52,109 --> 00:57:54,640
 

2591
00:57:52,119 --> 00:57:57,010
 conscience as scientists that you remind

2592
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:57,010
 

2593
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:59,230
 us that evidence is important good

2594
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,230
 

2595
00:57:57,010 --> 00:58:00,910
 quality evidence but I'm afraid this

2596
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:00,910
 

2597
00:57:59,230 --> 00:58:02,829
 might be fundamentally about incentives

2598
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:02,829
 

2599
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:04,960
 people actually are not very strongly

2600
00:58:02,819 --> 00:58:04,960
 

2601
00:58:02,829 --> 00:58:08,619
 incentivized to you know make their base

2602
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:08,619
 

2603
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:10,990
 lines look strong in the papers how can

2604
00:58:08,609 --> 00:58:10,990
 

2605
00:58:08,619 --> 00:58:13,750
 you use your great checklists you know

2606
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:13,750
 

2607
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:16,289
 in this science as this into institution

2608
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,289
 

2609
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:18,010
 project to actually reward good research

2610
00:58:16,279 --> 00:58:18,010
 

2611
00:58:16,289 --> 00:58:20,289
 mm-hmm

2612
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,289
 

2613
00:58:18,010 --> 00:58:22,720
 it depends a little bit on the context

2614
00:58:20,279 --> 00:58:22,720
 

2615
00:58:20,289 --> 00:58:25,630
 right I think sometimes like a healthy

2616
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:25,630
 

2617
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:27,880
 amount of competition can be helpful by

2618
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:27,880
 

2619
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:30,130
 asking different people to implement the

2620
00:58:27,870 --> 00:58:30,130
 

2621
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:33,160
 baseline versus a particular algorithm

2622
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:33,160
 

2623
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:35,380
 can be one way to kind of try things out

2624
00:58:33,150 --> 00:58:35,380
 

2625
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:37,180
 asking a second person to replicate in

2626
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:37,180
 

2627
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:39,010
 the lab some of the results can be

2628
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:39,010
 

2629
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:41,289
 another good way and then being very

2630
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,289
 

2631
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:43,180
 careful about documenting what space

2632
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:43,180
 

2633
00:58:41,289 --> 00:58:45,190
 it's it's a lot in the space of hyper

2634
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:45,190
 

2635
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:48,220
 parameters that is search that a lot of

2636
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:48,220
 

2637
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:50,410
 the competitive advantage comes and so

2638
00:58:48,210 --> 00:58:50,410
 

2639
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:53,440
 being diligent about making sure that

2640
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,440
 

2641
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:55,329
 you have appropriate appropriate

2642
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:55,329
 

2643
00:58:53,440 --> 00:59:00,940
 confidence that each of the methods were

2644
00:58:55,319 --> 00:59:00,940
 

2645
00:58:55,329 --> 00:59:05,049
 sufficiently explored compliments for

2646
00:59:00,930 --> 00:59:05,049
 

2647
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:08,590
 the talk it was very interesting I have

2648
00:59:05,039 --> 00:59:08,590
 

2649
00:59:05,049 --> 00:59:11,650
 a question for sure as you say it's from

2650
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:11,650
 

2651
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:14,740
 to document all you did during your

2652
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:14,740
 

2653
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:17,560
 numeric your experimental research okay

2654
00:59:14,730 --> 00:59:17,560
 

2655
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:20,020
 but for what concerns significance

2656
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:20,020
 

2657
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:22,870
 testing wouldn't that actually make the

2658
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:22,870
 

2659
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:24,910
 problem worse because in statistics a

2660
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:24,910
 

2661
00:59:22,870 --> 00:59:27,820
 lot of people are arguing for moving

2662
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:27,820
 

2663
00:59:24,910 --> 00:59:30,730
 away from null hypothesis significance

2664
00:59:27,810 --> 00:59:30,730
 

2665
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:32,380
 testing in especially in the case of

2666
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,380
 

2667
00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:35,050
 reinforcement learning where you can

2668
00:59:32,370 --> 00:59:35,050
 

2669
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:38,470
 decide with data to exclude how many

2670
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:38,470
 

2671
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:40,780
 runs to report which other parameters to

2672
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:40,780
 

2673
00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:42,940
 move if you don't really make a

2674
00:59:40,770 --> 00:59:42,940
 

2675
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:46,120
 pre-registration of your study before

2676
00:59:42,930 --> 00:59:46,120
 

2677
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:48,250
 then that p-value that we you will get

2678
00:59:46,110 --> 00:59:48,250
 

2679
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:50,860
 can be basically anything anything it's

2680
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,860
 

2681
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:53,170
 very difficult to compare it so it makes

2682
00:59:50,850 --> 00:59:53,170
 

2683
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:55,540
 things in my opinion more complicated

2684
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:55,540
 

2685
00:59:53,170 --> 00:59:57,100
 not simpler yeah I think this is an

2686
00:59:55,530 --> 00:59:57,100
 

2687
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:58,870
 excellent point and in a sense you know

2688
00:59:57,090 --> 00:59:58,870
 

2689
00:59:57,100 --> 01:00:01,180
 everything you say and everything we've

2690
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:01,180
 

2691
00:59:58,870 --> 01:00:04,300
 heard about this applies in this case

2692
01:00:01,170 --> 01:00:04,300
 

2693
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:07,240
 also there's no magic bullet I think you

2694
01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:07,240
 

2695
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:09,220
 know documentation and accountability is

2696
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:09,220
 

2697
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:12,640
 no replacement for good science and good

2698
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:12,640
 

2699
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:14,620
 methodology I think we don't yet have we

2700
01:00:12,630 --> 01:00:14,620
 

2701
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:16,420
 don't have anything new to suggest to

2702
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:16,420
 

2703
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:18,370
 address some of the challenges in terms

2704
01:00:16,410 --> 01:00:18,370
 

2705
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:20,530
 of significance testing I think we're

2706
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:20,530
 

2707
01:00:18,370 --> 01:00:22,450
 really aware of what's going on and

2708
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,450
 

2709
01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:24,190
 looking to other communities to see if

2710
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:24,190
 

2711
01:00:22,450 --> 01:00:25,150
 there's better ways to do this but at

2712
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:25,150
 

2713
01:00:24,190 --> 01:00:26,710
 this stage really

2714
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:26,710
 

2715
01:00:25,150 --> 01:00:29,110
 I'm calling for more thorough

2716
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:29,110
 

2717
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:31,120
 documentation and accountability but

2718
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:31,120
 

2719
01:00:29,110 --> 01:00:33,850
 it's good to remember that it doesn't

2720
01:00:31,110 --> 01:00:33,850
 

2721
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:35,760
 it's not a solution in itself to some of

2722
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:35,760
 

2723
01:00:33,850 --> 01:00:38,020
 the challenges thank you

2724
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:38,020
 

2725
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:39,220
 all right this will need to be our last

2726
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:39,220
 

2727
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:40,870
 question but I'm sure Joelle will be

2728
01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:40,870
 

2729
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:42,960
 happy to answer questions offline does

2730
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:42,960
 

2731
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:47,210
 so let's thank her again

2732
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:47,210
 

2733
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:48,660
[Applause]

2734
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,660
 

2735
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:50,510
 all right

2736
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:50,510
 

2737
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:52,560
 and then we have a break and then the

2738
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:52,560
 

2739
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:55,970
 various sessions of the different tracks

2740
01:00:52,550 --> 01:00:55,970
 

2741
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:55,970
 we'll be starting in a few minutes
