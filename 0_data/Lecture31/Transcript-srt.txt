8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,020
What I'm going to
be talking about

9
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,330
is some of the
fundamental work that

10
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:29,030
has been done
trying to understand

11
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:35,240
neural basis for memory
and spatial perception

12
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:41,720
and cognition that comes
largely from behavioral and

13
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,680
electrophysiological studies
in the brain system that's

14
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,670
shown here-- the hippocampus.

15
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,206
And as I was mentioning
before we started,

16
00:00:51,206 --> 00:00:52,580
this year's Nobel
Prize was given

17
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,580
to John O'Keefe, who
discovered the properties

18
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,010
of individual neurons
in the hippocampus

19
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:02,840
by applying these
methods for recording

20
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,690
the discharge of
single cells by putting

21
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,100
little wires into the brain--
so-called extracellular

22
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:08,600
recordings.

23
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,350
You put in a wire.

24
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,180
The tip of the electrode can
record electrical discharge

25
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,114
of cells.

26
00:01:14,114 --> 00:01:15,530
You measure the
discharge of cells

27
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:18,230
as animals move around in space.

28
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:22,100
And you try to figure out what
this part of the brain does.

29
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,320
Now where the observation
part of science

30
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,000
comes in in this
case is interesting,

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,140
because it relates to another
aspect of neuroscience.

32
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:37,910
And that is the relationship
between the neurobiology

33
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,060
and behavior.

34
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,710
And this is an approach known
as a neuroethological approach.

35
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,760
And that's studying
the brain systems

36
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:51,010
in the context in which they
actually evolve and were used.

37
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:56,540
And so that could apply
to the use of song

38
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,100
as a mechanism of
communication in birds.

39
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,920
It can come from
the finding prey

40
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,190
in the dark, when it comes
sound-localization owls.

41
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:14,030
In the case of rodents,
O'Keefe appreciated the fact

42
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,120
that the hippocampus
in rodents really

43
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,170
has a primary role in
spatial navigation--

44
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,120
that animals that have
damaged the hippocampus

45
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,310
have problems with
spatial navigation.

46
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,770
And the hippocampus
had been studied up

47
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:31,130
to that point using animals
that were head-fixed.

48
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,580
So you take a little rat.

49
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,370
You fix his head.

50
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,786
And the reason for
fixing its head

51
00:02:35,786 --> 00:02:38,480
is for convenience,
largely, so that when

52
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,850
you place these little
electrodes into the brain,

53
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,014
the animal doesn't move.

54
00:02:42,014 --> 00:02:42,680
They don't move.

55
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,638
Electrode moves, you
can't get good recordings.

56
00:02:44,638 --> 00:02:47,190
So you need to keep
the preparation fixed.

57
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,530
So you fix the animal's head.

58
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,030
Then you figure out
ways to actually

59
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:54,380
look, to study the system
given the constraints

60
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,370
of the methodology.

61
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:00,800
And that involved, largely,
before John O'Keefe in 1970,

62
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,640
using methods of
classical conditioning.

63
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,170
So you might be familiar
with basic learning theory.

64
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:09,320
And how do we learn
how to do things?

65
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,800
Well, it's basically
chaining together

66
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,290
stimulus response associations.

67
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,950
You see something,
you do something,

68
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,830
you get rewarded for doing that.

69
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,510
You're more likely to do
that again in the future.

70
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,350
This is a basic
Pavlovian conditioning.

71
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,090
I ring a bell, you get food.

72
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,980
You associate bell
with the food.

73
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,710
And so that was the thinking--
that all of cognition

74
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:34,190
can be built up from basic
stimulus-response associations.

75
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,050
But there was a
movement around the time

76
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,380
that O'Keefe was
doing this work that

77
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,900
proposed that that
was insufficient--

78
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,547
that simple behavioral simple
stimulus response learning was

79
00:03:44,547 --> 00:03:46,130
insufficient, that
there was some kind

80
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:52,400
of internal foundation upon
which learning was applied.

81
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,740
And this was the
so-called cognitive theory

82
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,070
of learning and memory.

83
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:01,310
And the hippocampus
was posited beta-site

84
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:05,930
of one property of
this cognitive learning

85
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,370
as applied to space.

86
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:10,740
And the observation was
actually a fairly simple one.

87
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,080
If you take a rat--

88
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,700
I see you want to
learn something.

89
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:20,839
That is, if you want to learn
to associate a cue with food

90
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:24,920
or you want to train it to go
over and press a lever for food

91
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,616
or-- you want it
to learn something,

92
00:04:26,616 --> 00:04:27,990
and you do this
in an environment

93
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,966
and put it in a box.

94
00:04:28,966 --> 00:04:31,090
Well, if you take a rat
and you put it in that box,

95
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:33,674
let's say, the day before,
and just let it wander around.

96
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:34,340
It does nothing.

97
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,710
It just explores space.

98
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,620
You take it out.

99
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,230
And now we take two rats-- one
that's been in the box before

100
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,550
and one that has not
been in the box before--

101
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,050
and the rat that
has been in the box

102
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,174
before will learn faster
than the animal has not

103
00:04:45,174 --> 00:04:45,840
been in the box.

104
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,300
And you say, why would just
passive exposure to that box

105
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,900
enhance it's learning?

106
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,420
And this phenomena is
known as latent learning.

107
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,550
The animal had learned
something that it could then

108
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:02,390
apply to this new learning even
though it was not instructive.

109
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:05,340
It wasn't rewarded for doing
anything, it just explored.

110
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,150
And so this idea that there was
some sort of latent capacity

111
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:14,000
to enhance learning
was motivated

112
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,480
the study of the
hippocampus in the context

113
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,140
of non-head-fixed recording.

114
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,440
And so it keeps real inside.

115
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,930
In fact, the paper that was
cited for the Nobel Prize

116
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,939
was the paper in which he first
recorded from these cells--

117
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:32,480
and all he did was just take
the animals out of the ear bars.

118
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,188
So he took the animal
out of the ear bars

119
00:05:34,188 --> 00:05:36,750
and just let it run around on
a tabletop, just like this,

120
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,250
actually.

121
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,650
It was a table at the
University College

122
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:42,571
London about this size where
the rat just kind of wandered

123
00:05:42,571 --> 00:05:43,070
around.

124
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:46,040
And he made observations-- oh,
here's a cell that fires when

125
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,820
the animal goes over
to the left hand side--

126
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,250
very descriptive,
but the key insight

127
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,680
was to study the
hippocampus when rats are

128
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,670
doing what rats normally do--

129
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,510
explore in space.

130
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,340
So it was this
ethological approach.

131
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:08,034
And what he discovered was that
cells in the hippocampus.--

132
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,200
and this is a cross-section.

133
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,769
The hippocampus is found here.

134
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:12,185
It's in the medial
temporal lobes.

135
00:06:15,329 --> 00:06:17,620
The name hippocampus comes
from the Greek for seahorse,

136
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:21,380
so in humans, it sort of
looks like a seahorse.

137
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:25,220
The regions here--
the terminology CA,

138
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,950
these different fields
of the hippocampus,

139
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,770
comes from cornu
ammonis, or Amman's horn.

140
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,520
That's because it looks
like a ram's horn.

141
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,940
So if you think about it,
it's like little ram's horns

142
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,690
right here, put them
in the temporal lobes

143
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:36,500
and you move them
in there, that's

144
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,583
where your hippocampus is.

145
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:39,620
Just like this.

146
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,287
And if you make a cross-section,
slice through that,

147
00:06:43,287 --> 00:06:44,120
this is the circuit.

148
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,530
So information comes in
from across the brain,

149
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:53,670
converges in the primary
input to the hippocampus--

150
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:59,000
that's called entorhinal cortex,
which is what the other Nobel

151
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,540
Prize was awarded to--

152
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:07,310
the husband and wife team that
had discovered and identified

153
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,040
the properties of cells
in the entorhinal cortex,

154
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,130
these so-called grid cells
that seem to carry information

155
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:18,500
about actual, it seemed
like, Cartesian-like spatial

156
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,559
information conveyed
in the hippocampus.

157
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:22,850
So stuff comes in from the
rest of the brain, converges

158
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,980
in the entorhinal cortex,
and then goes around

159
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:28,490
this little loop, from these
three primary subfields--

160
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:34,520
the dentate gyrus, CA cornu
ammonis 3, CA1, subiculum,

161
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,270
and back on again.

162
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,820
So it goes through this loop.

163
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,320
Classically, it had
been referred to

164
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,420
as the trisynaptic loop.

165
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:46,620
One synapse, dentate, CA3,
CA1, and then back out.

166
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:50,150
And again, recordings in
this part of the hippocampus

167
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,700
reveal the properties
which I'll mention,

168
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:57,290
and that is that the cells
respond to locations in space.

169
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:00,250
But prior to that--

170
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,780
this electrophysiological
work in rodents--

171
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,920
there had been human
neuropsychological work,

172
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,680
in particular the seminal
case of the patient HM who

173
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,230
had been studied
here for many decades

174
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:15,610
before he just
recently passed away.

175
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:25,010
Known as HM, or Henry Molaison,
as he is sort of recently

176
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:32,939
revealed to be a patient who had
undergone bilateral resection

177
00:08:32,939 --> 00:08:33,980
of medial temporal lobes.

178
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:37,731
Cut out parts of his
hippocampus and other

179
00:08:37,731 --> 00:08:39,480
associated medial
temporal lobe structures

180
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,834
to treat intractable epilepsy.

181
00:08:41,834 --> 00:08:44,250
He subsequently lost the ability
to form any new memories.

182
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:48,860
So had permanent
anterograde- couldn't

183
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,530
form any new memories going
forward in the future and lost

184
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,940
some of his older memories.

185
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,470
So you lose memories
in humans, rodents

186
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,690
can't navigate in space, also
humans have a spatial deficit,

187
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,440
so there's some connection
between space and memory.

188
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,480
And the question
is, what is that?

189
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,300
What would link spatial
navigation and memory?

190
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,967
But not just any
kind of memory--

191
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,800
what we refer to as
episodic memory-- memory

192
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,610
for events or experiences.

193
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,420
And so the working hypothesis
is that these two things

194
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,570
are really connected by a
need, a computation imperative,

195
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:23,800
to maintain information
about time order.

196
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,390
And that is, if you're
going to use experience

197
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,950
to guide future
behavior, you need

198
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,320
to figure out what the
causal relationships are

199
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,020
between events in the world.

200
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,560
If I see A and B, what I
really want to figure out--

201
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,060
I don't just want
to record the fact

202
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,710
that A and B happen together.

203
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,990
Ultimately, I want
to try to understand

204
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:45,170
the relationship between
A and B. Did A cause B,

205
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:49,720
or how might I actually
predict B given A?

206
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,560
And the way I
would do that would

207
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,720
be to construct some kind
of simple internal model,

208
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,470
a predictive model, that's
based on experience.

209
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:01,202
And so the idea is, hippocampus
captures experience,

210
00:10:01,202 --> 00:10:03,160
and then sort through
some process, which we'll

211
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,320
refer to as the process
of consolidation,

212
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,370
translates experience into
some working model that

213
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:13,180
can predict events and can
be used to guide behavior

214
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,410
in decision making.

215
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,450
And critical to that
is just the idea

216
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:21,080
of time and a
particular time order.

217
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:26,740
So as I mentioned, the use
of very simple technology,

218
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:31,030
in this case extracellular
neurophysiological recording--

219
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:35,530
taking a tiny wire-- this wire
is actually four small wires,

220
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:38,699
each one about 10
microns across.

221
00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:40,490
You twist them together
in a little bundle.

222
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,430
The bundle is about 35 microns.

223
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:45,470
Human hair is on the order of
typically about 50 microns,

224
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:49,420
so these are wires, or
multi contact electrodes,

225
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,280
about as large as a human hair.

226
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,630
We thread these things
through the little oil rig

227
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:58,210
drilling device here, which is--

228
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:02,950
these little micromanipulators
allow this wire

229
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:06,220
to be driven down through
very small guide cannula,

230
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,680
and so out the bottom
will be a number

231
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,290
of these independent
individual electrodes,

232
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:15,010
each controlled by their
own micromanipulator.

233
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,930
So we can send these
electrodes down--

234
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:19,720
this entire device,
in this case,

235
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,310
weighs anywhere
from 12 to 20 grams,

236
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:27,130
and this can be placed
on an animal's head

237
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:30,430
permanently or chronically, and
that is that once it goes on,

238
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:31,570
it doesn't come off.

239
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:36,370
So they will have this
little helmet like thing

240
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:40,540
on their head, a small
opening is made in the skull,

241
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:44,980
the wires are sent through, and
the whole surgical procedure

242
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,190
takes maybe 30 to 45 minutes.

243
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,670
It's like an outpatient thing.

244
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,211
It would probably
take longer to have

245
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:55,060
your wisdom teeth pulled than to
have a brain implant installed.

246
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,340
But then once this is
installed, these electrodes

247
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:01,300
can be driven down and
placed permanently.

248
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,790
It gives you the ability
to monitor pattern activity

249
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:09,850
across large populations
over long periods of time--

250
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,710
days, weeks, months.

251
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:17,590
So you have tapped into
activity in this brain area,

252
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:24,060
and you can monitor as animals
experience, learn, and recall.

253
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,860
This is what the
raw data looks like.

254
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,450
This is a cartoon of the
electrode with four contacts.

255
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:30,010
The idea with the
four contacts is

256
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,880
it gives you the ability
to triangulate location,

257
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,760
much as you stereoscopically
can determine depth.

258
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,280
These four contacts
will give you

259
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,590
the ability to
triangulate things

260
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,330
in three dimensional space.

261
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,240
One of the properties of this
hippocampal circuit, and that

262
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,010
is-- so this little
cross-section-- you

263
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,060
imagine a neuron here.

264
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,560
And so there are
going to be, again,

265
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,970
neurons distributed
across the hippocampus.

266
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:58,960
In the rat, there are on
the order of maybe 200,000

267
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,750
cells in area CA1.

268
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:05,230
In the entire hippocampus,
there are on the order of one

269
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:07,370
to two million cells.

270
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:10,720
And if you drop an electrode
any place into the hippocampus,

271
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,870
you will find cells that have
this kind of spatial property.

272
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:17,650
And so what that says is
that spatial information

273
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:21,480
is distributed not
in a topographic way.

274
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,210
In other words, it's not
one location in space

275
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:29,590
is mapped into one location
in the hippocampus.

276
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:33,100
Unlike some of the sensory
areas that have this kind

277
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,490
of topography, for instance,
if you record in the visual

278
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:39,850
cortex, where there was there
would be some correspondence

279
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:43,090
between location
and visual field,

280
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:48,210
and the location of cells in
the cortex that respond to that

281
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:50,050
so-called retinotopic mapping--

282
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:51,880
visual field mapped
onto the anatomy.

283
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,400
Same thing with the
somatosensory system.

284
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,840
As I move and I touch
different parts of the body,

285
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,520
the cells that respond to
that will be mapped out

286
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:04,510
in a largely one-to-one
correspondence

287
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:10,370
between the adjacency of
stimuli in the input space

288
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,610
and adjacency of
the representation

289
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:15,770
in the neural space that does
not occur in the hippocampus.

290
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:18,730
Two cells that are right
next to one another

291
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:23,710
are no more likely to respond
to nearby locations in space

292
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:26,570
than two cells that are
distant from one another.

293
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:29,890
So, as we'll discuss,
the principle

294
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:33,250
of information representation
in the hippocampus

295
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:38,410
appears to be one of kind of
sparse distributed patterning,

296
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:44,620
that you have lots of
cells that will respond

297
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:48,220
to different environments
and individual cells

298
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,355
don't have a unique
relationship to locations.

299
00:14:50,355 --> 00:14:52,480
It's really the pattern
across cells that gives you

300
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,504
a unique signature of code.

301
00:14:55,504 --> 00:14:56,920
We're taking
advantage of the fact

302
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,490
that you don't necessarily
have to place the electrodes

303
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:05,060
at the proper place in
order to get responses

304
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,680
in some location in space.

305
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,470
Anywhere you put these
electrodes in the hippocampus,

306
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:12,100
you're going to get
a certain fraction--

307
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,570
generally about 30% of
the cells will respond

308
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,770
in the given environment.

309
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,860
And this is what those
responses look like.

310
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:23,870
I won't go through the technical
details, but, needless to say,

311
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:27,050
this just shows
how events, action

312
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,050
potentials that are detected--

313
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:31,700
in here, you see a voltage
trace, you pick out

314
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:40,070
the amplitude of these little
voltage transients generated

315
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,570
by action potentials
in the cells,

316
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:45,552
you plot the amplitude across
these different channels.

317
00:15:45,552 --> 00:15:47,510
In this way, each point
is an action potential,

318
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:51,230
and what you see is that
the amplitudes will cluster

319
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,480
in a way that reflect
the relative position

320
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,480
or location of cells--

321
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,060
the sources relative
to these wires,

322
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:03,441
using the basic principle that
if you're closer to a wire,

323
00:16:03,441 --> 00:16:04,940
the signal is going
to get stronger.

324
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:11,660
So amplitude is essentially
inversely related to distance.

325
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:15,380
So here, this is the amplitude
of an action potential plot

326
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,180
across two channels.

327
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,520
These points are
larger on channel one,

328
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,900
small on channel 2.

329
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:24,739
That means it's close to
channel 1, far from channel 2.

330
00:16:24,739 --> 00:16:27,030
And then different cells will
have different relations.

331
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:29,655
This will be large on channel 2,
small on channel 1, et cetera.

332
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,720
So you can figure out where
these cells are in space,

333
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,250
means you can pick out lots
of cells from, in this case,

334
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,850
maybe 12 to 18 electrodes
can give you 50

335
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:42,972
to 100 or more cells.

336
00:16:42,972 --> 00:16:44,930
And then looking at the
activity of those cells

337
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:45,890
in a simple box--

338
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:49,310
this is just a little box, one
wall removed, little ceiling

339
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:53,390
of cubes, simple
architectural design,

340
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:56,400
nice, clean and simple--

341
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:01,910
what you get is clean and simple
mapping of spatial locations

342
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,390
into these neural responses.

343
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:08,810
So each one of these panels
represents the activity

344
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:09,740
of individual cells.

345
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:13,010
So this is about 80
simultaneously recorded cells.

346
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:18,530
The color of the heat map
indicates the firing rate

347
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,369
of these individual cells.

348
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:24,510
Red indicates high firing
rate, blue indicates no firing.

349
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,036
So this is a top down
view of that box.

350
00:17:27,036 --> 00:17:29,660
So this cell, for instance, when
the animal is wandering around

351
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,290
in the box, the cell is
silent in all the blue areas,

352
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:34,290
and when it goes in the
lower right hand corner,

353
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,630
the cell fires vigorously.

354
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,930
So silent, fires vigorously.

355
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,610
This one fires on
the left hand wall.

356
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,750
This one also fires on
the lower right hand side.

357
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,640
So this points out the
combinatorial nature

358
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,010
of this spatial
representation, and that

359
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:51,290
is that if the animal is
in the lower right hand

360
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:53,810
corner of this
particular box, we'll

361
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:55,250
get these two cells to fire.

362
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:58,580
If I take the animal and I
put it into a different box,

363
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,994
all of these responses
will be scrambled up.

364
00:18:00,994 --> 00:18:02,660
There's nothing that
says this cell will

365
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,482
fire in the lower right
hand corner of another box.

366
00:18:05,482 --> 00:18:07,940
And certainly, even if it does
fire in the lower right hand

367
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:12,420
corner, this other cell isn't
going to fire along with it.

368
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,680
And at any given location,
there are roughly 1% to 5%

369
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,010
of the cells that are firing.

370
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:22,062
So at any given location, there
are about maybe 5,000 cells

371
00:18:22,062 --> 00:18:23,520
in the hippocampus
that are active.

372
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:29,180
So the unique location and
unique context and environments

373
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:33,980
can be conveyed across a unique
pattern of about 5,000 cells

374
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,800
out of 100,000 or 200,000 cells.

375
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,300
So there's large
combinatorial space

376
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:44,270
in which one can represent
unique locations or potentially

377
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:48,470
even unique experiences
within different locations.

378
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,510
You see that many
cells are silent.

379
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,160
On average, about
30% of the cells

380
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,130
respond in any
given environment.

381
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,930
The silent cells,
as we'll see, they

382
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:59,672
can be detected when the
animals are not in a running

383
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:01,880
around or experiencing space,
but when they're asleep

384
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,310
or in these other
offline states,

385
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:09,500
when the hippocampus is actually
thinking about other stuff.

386
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,320
We'll talk about that a bit.

387
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,890
And then here, you can also see
a small number of these cells.

388
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:24,230
In this case, about 5%
to 10% of these cells

389
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:28,210
seem to have elevated firing
rate across the entire space.

390
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,210
These are actually a
different class of neurons.

391
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,530
These are excitatory neurons.

392
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:32,760
These are inhibitory neurons.

393
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,430
The inhibition,
the idea that you

394
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:37,880
have circuits that can
both excite and inhibit,

395
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:42,120
and that this is used
as a circuit property

396
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:47,480
to sculpt computation
is something

397
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,620
that we'll also discuss.

398
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,080
So there's balance between
excitation as kind of a circuit

399
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,400
principle that's used.

400
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,080
Inhibitory cells fire
all over the place.

401
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,170
They're not really
communicating information.

402
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:01,740
They're really modulating the
processing of information.

403
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,540
And another property
of these cells

404
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:07,410
that O'Keefe termed
place cells is that when

405
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:11,970
animals are constrained to move
along these limited paths--

406
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,972
in this case, this is a linear
track, as we refer to it.

407
00:20:14,972 --> 00:20:16,430
It's like a little
corridor, and it

408
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:18,090
was moving down this corridor.

409
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:20,280
When they move down a
corridor, cells don't only

410
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,470
fire where the animal is, but
also in the direction that it's

411
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:22,970
going.

412
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:25,320
And so this is the
first indication

413
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,890
these cells are not just--
again, it's not just a GPS.

414
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:30,360
It's not telling
you where you are.

415
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,010
It's at least telling
you where you're

416
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:34,650
going, maybe what you're doing.

417
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,607
So here, if I look
at this yellow cell,

418
00:20:36,607 --> 00:20:38,940
I can tell that the animal
is not only in this location,

419
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:44,120
but it's moving down this
linear track in this direction.

420
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,940
So there's going to be a unique
sequence when the animal walks

421
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,020
along this path--

422
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,940
yellow cell, red
cell, green cell.

423
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,280
So the different cells
are color coded here.

424
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,070
So if you look over
time, you'll see

425
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:59,850
that there will be a
unique sequence of activity

426
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:02,780
in the hippocampus that reflects
the animal's actual behavior

427
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,640
experienced in that space.

428
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,755
So here, this is just a
little movie that shows raw--

429
00:21:07,755 --> 00:21:09,630
this is what you would
actually see if you're

430
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:10,710
running the experiment.

431
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,001
This is a little top down view.

432
00:21:12,001 --> 00:21:16,200
The green circle just highlights
where the rat actually is.

433
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,910
The color coding--
these are the cells

434
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,420
that we're picking up over here.

435
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,160
This is data as it would
be coming out of a set up.

436
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,480
You see, this light
blue cell fires here,

437
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,757
the dark blue cell fires here.

438
00:21:26,757 --> 00:21:28,090
Dark blue cell, light blue cell.

439
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:30,690
So this is the spatial
firing property, place cells.

440
00:21:35,645 --> 00:21:36,976
So the animal has stopped.

441
00:21:36,976 --> 00:21:39,350
The one thing you will notice--
you saw lots of activity,

442
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:41,460
and animal stopped there, there
was this big burst of activity.

443
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,959
He'll stop again a
little bit later.

444
00:21:48,814 --> 00:21:49,830
Now he's moving.

445
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,880
Now when he's moving ,
if you listen carefully,

446
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,550
you'll hear that there's
this background rhythm.

447
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:04,550
There's a modulation
that's going ch-ch-ch-ch.

448
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:07,400
Background modulation
activity which

449
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,470
is associated with locomotion.

450
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,510
So there are really two modes--

451
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:14,250
you're actively engaged or when
you're taking information in,

452
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,940
you get this rhythm.

453
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,440
When you're inattentive, not
engaged, not taking information

454
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,106
in, but internally
evaluated, the rhythm

455
00:22:20,106 --> 00:22:24,620
goes away and is replaced
by these bursts of activity.

456
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:29,480
And so these two modes,
active attentive--

457
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,350
you're processing information
coming in, inattentive--

458
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:37,010
you're evaluating information,
you're thinking about stuff--

459
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:40,880
can be reflected in these two
characteristic modes, which

460
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,420
you can literally hear.

461
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,277
You can hear the
difference between the two.

462
00:22:44,277 --> 00:22:46,860
Obviously, I've been listening
to these things for a long time

463
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,545
so it's very easy
for me to pick up.

464
00:22:48,545 --> 00:22:52,720
It might be harder for you but,
you listen to it a little bit

465
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,710
and it's very easy to
distinguish these two

466
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:55,720
different brain routes.

467
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,761
So this is going to be
another view of that data.

468
00:22:57,761 --> 00:23:00,380
So same data, only now, instead
of showing you the raw data,

469
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,210
where is the firing.

470
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:06,080
And that's one thing about this
correlate that's so compelling.

471
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,660
That was literally raw
data as it was coming out.

472
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,480
There's no processing at all
and you could see the correlate,

473
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,750
you can see the spatial
correlate, which tells you,

474
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,880
this is not something
that requires

475
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,730
I have to do
multiple regressions,

476
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:25,170
and show you all of the--

477
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:30,260
give you some sort of
statistical confidence

478
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,180
that this is what the
hippocampus is doing.

479
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,790
You can literally see
it in individual cells.

480
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:38,345
The spatial correlate is
extremely robust, compelling,

481
00:23:38,345 --> 00:23:39,780
and consistent.

482
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,390
Those cells weren't selected.

483
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:43,670
If you record any of the
cells in the hippocampus,

484
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:44,930
they're all doing that.

485
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:47,630
The estimate is that over
95% of the cells that you

486
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,350
can record in rodent
hippocampus will

487
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,600
have these spatial properties.

488
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,410
So it's really a fundamental
property of this memory system.

489
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:56,090
So this is the same
data, except now,

490
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:57,780
instead of showing
the spiking, we're

491
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:01,250
going to use this simple
Bayesian Estimation

492
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,350
Algorithm to ask the question.

493
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:08,090
"OK, if we know which
cells are firing,

494
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:11,980
can we guess the location that
the animal would likely be?"

495
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:16,970
That is, if we know the firing
as a function of location,

496
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:20,640
we can use a Bayesian inference
to guess the probability

497
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,176
of location, given firing.

498
00:24:23,176 --> 00:24:24,800
And that's what we're
going to do here.

499
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,590
Just asking, if we know
which cells are firing--

500
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,420
for instance, if the
blue cell is firing,

501
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,820
you would say, "Oh, the
animal's probably over here."

502
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:35,150
So recording across, looking
at pattern across many cells,

503
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:39,770
and then we're coming up
every 100 milliseconds,

504
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,990
we're coming up
with a probability

505
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:44,600
that that pattern could have
occurred if the animal was

506
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,939
at any location on this track.

507
00:24:45,939 --> 00:24:48,230
And the probability is going
to be shown by a triangle.

508
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:50,040
Big triangle means
high probability.

509
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:55,580
And what you'll see is,
when we do this estimation,

510
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:59,470
when the animal's moving,
you see the triangle.

511
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:04,370
The triangles are
only highly probable

512
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:07,310
when the animal is
actually moving,

513
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:09,410
and only at the location
that the animal is.

514
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:11,130
So the hippocampus
is centrally--

515
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:12,505
the hippocampus
representation is

516
00:25:12,505 --> 00:25:15,540
tracking the location the animal
and also when the animal stops.

517
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:20,570
Now, if you listen,
you heard the burst

518
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:22,760
and you look at the triangle,
when the animal stops,

519
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,275
the triangle no
longer corresponds

520
00:25:24,275 --> 00:25:25,290
to where the animal is.

521
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,790
In fact, when you
get the burst, you

522
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,580
see the triangle jumping
around the track.

523
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,350
So again, there's
these two modes

524
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:34,010
and the representations
have these two properties.

525
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:38,240
Moving, oscillation,
track current location.

526
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,832
Stopping, oscillation goes
away, representation now

527
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:43,790
jumps across the track.

528
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:50,780
And interestingly, these
little bursts, like that,

529
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,906
also occur, not just when
the animal stops briefly,

530
00:25:52,906 --> 00:25:54,363
but when it actually
goes to sleep.

531
00:25:54,363 --> 00:25:56,224
So here on the inset,
this is the animal now

532
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,890
has been taken off
the track altogether.

533
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,931
It's just sitting in a
little box somewhere else,

534
00:25:59,931 --> 00:26:02,600
it's curled up, and it's asleep.

535
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,240
You get these same bursts
and when you decode activity,

536
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,930
you find you can decode
the position on the track

537
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:11,840
and, if you look carefully, you
see that the position actually

538
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,320
follows a sequence of
trajectory along the track.

539
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,010
And we'll go into that in
a little bit more detail.

540
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:22,520
So you think of there being
these two states, the offline

541
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,210
and the online.

542
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:26,960
And the online, when
the animal's moving,

543
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,770
the characteristic mode of
activity in the hippocampus

544
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:34,250
is an oscillatory mode,
described as the theta rhythm,

545
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,900
which is this 10
hertz oscillation.

546
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,600
When the animal
stops and becomes

547
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,550
quiet and immobile, within
about half a second,

548
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:44,750
oscillation goes
away and is replaced

549
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:48,730
by these large transient
aperiodic events,

550
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:51,620
these so-called
sharp waves, because

551
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:54,530
in the extracellular
electrical field

552
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:57,847
that you measure, you see
these large deflections.

553
00:26:57,847 --> 00:26:58,930
And then, if you zoom in--

554
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:02,310
I'll also show you shortly--

555
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:05,090
you can actually see that
these very high frequency

556
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:08,630
oscillations, about 100 to 200
hertz, riding on top of that,

557
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,520
these are referred
to as, ripples.

558
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:16,280
And this is the term that
Gyorgy Buzsaki came up with.

559
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,800
He described this sharp
wave ripple activity

560
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:24,140
as corresponding to this
offline state, quiet wakeful,

561
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:28,040
and some sleep states.

562
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:32,150
So the first thing is to look
at this oscillatory state.

563
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,779
So an animal's actually moving.

564
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:36,320
And I've already shown you the
spatial correlate, these place

565
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:36,830
cells.

566
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:39,740
But there's another
property of these cells

567
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:42,020
that O'Keefe also discovered.

568
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:45,777
But this was in early
1990s, around 1991.

569
00:27:45,777 --> 00:27:47,360
And that is, he
noted, if you actually

570
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,870
look at the discharge of
single spikes with respect

571
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:53,180
to this oscillation,
first of all,

572
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,060
the spikes are
actually phase locked.

573
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,230
In other words, here
spikes fire when

574
00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:01,160
the oscillation, this theta
rhythm, is at its peak.

575
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,170
So the idea is, this
oscillation really

576
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:05,930
reflects time
varying excitability,

577
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:08,780
sometimes where
cells likely to fire,

578
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:09,910
other times when it's not.

579
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:14,360
And you can think of this
oscillation in excitability

580
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:19,040
as being an oscillation
in relative excitability,

581
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:19,820
or inhibitions.

582
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,490
So inhibition, elevation
is high, it's low,

583
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:23,990
its high, it's low.

584
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:25,850
When inhibition is
low, cell fires.

585
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:27,860
When it's high,
cell doesn't fire.

586
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:30,030
So this is modulation
excitability.

587
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:30,780
You see this here.

588
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,280
But he noted another
thing, and that

589
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,610
is, if you look at
the precise phase--

590
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:37,760
so here, yes, cells tend
to fire at the peak,

591
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,330
but here, this is now
over time, but animal

592
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:44,210
moving at constant
velocity, space, and time,

593
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:45,840
are interchangeable.

594
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,890
So as the animal's moving
through it's place field,

595
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:53,690
the spikes start to fire earlier
and earlier, as this phase

596
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,250
code, spatial location.

597
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:59,520
So you can tell, based
upon the relative phase,

598
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,050
whether the animal is just
entering the field, spikes fire

599
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:06,650
late, here close to the
peak, versus further

600
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:09,735
into the field, where they
fire a little bit earlier.

601
00:29:09,735 --> 00:29:11,360
There's a relationship
between distance

602
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,480
into the field and
relative phase.

603
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,280
What he termed,
phase precession.

604
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,840
And this is a
representation of that.

605
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,126
This is actual data.

606
00:29:19,126 --> 00:29:20,750
This is just a cartoon
that illustrates

607
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,070
the basic principle.

608
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:24,507
And so the idea that,
if I have a place cell,

609
00:29:24,507 --> 00:29:26,090
if I look at the
marginal distribution

610
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:28,680
as a function of location,
this would be the place field.

611
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,990
Otherwise, it would just
collapse all of this.

612
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:34,700
This is the spiking now, as a
function of position and phase.

613
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,190
If I just look at spiking
as a function of position,

614
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:40,430
as just the density of
firing, what I would get

615
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:42,140
is a place field.

616
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:45,500
Not many spikes here as the
animal enters the field, lots

617
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,210
of spikes here as
you get into-- this

618
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:50,244
would be the classic
spatial receptive field.

619
00:29:50,244 --> 00:29:52,410
But now, if I introduce
phase, as well, now you say,

620
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:54,576
"Oh, wait, there's a
systematic relationship as well

621
00:29:54,576 --> 00:29:57,930
between phase and location."

622
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:02,600
In fact, phase is a better
predictor of relative location

623
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,265
than firing rate.

624
00:30:04,265 --> 00:30:07,220
If I asked, when
did the spike occur?

625
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:11,150
If it occurred
here, late in phase,

626
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:13,570
then I know the animal is
just entering the field.

627
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:15,850
If it occurs early
in phase, I know

628
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:18,200
it's at the end of its field.

629
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,490
And that's interesting.

630
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:24,320
And this is a simple
model that says, well,

631
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,510
an easy way of explaining
that is, if you just

632
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,925
have this excitability model--

633
00:30:27,925 --> 00:30:29,300
and this was one
of the questions

634
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,880
that I guess you asked about
this sweeping inhibition.

635
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,940
So if we just imagine
that you have an input,

636
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:39,050
excitatory input, shown in blue,
and then an inhibitory input,

637
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:42,080
shown in red, where the
inhibition is oscillating,

638
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:47,000
and you apply a very
simple biophysical model

639
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,540
that says, a spike
action potential is

640
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,790
going to occur when
excitation and blue exceeds

641
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:52,750
inhibition and red.

642
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,920
More excitation inhibition,
you get a spike.

643
00:30:54,920 --> 00:31:01,270
So here, in this oscillation,
anywhere the red trace

644
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:03,640
is higher than the
blue trace, no spiking.

645
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:07,180
So in this case, when
excitation is low,

646
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,370
you have to wait until
inhibition drops all the way

647
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:11,050
to here to get a spike.

648
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,770
This is late-phase.

649
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,440
So weak excitation
means you have

650
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,080
to wait until inhibition is low.

651
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,847
So this is the
sweeping inhibition,

652
00:31:18,847 --> 00:31:20,180
you have to wait until it's low.

653
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:23,560
When excitation is strong, I
don't have to wait so long.

654
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,250
It can fire earlier.

655
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,730
So the principle here is
that there is a relationship

656
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:29,260
between magnitude and latency.

657
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,376
Stronger means earlier.

658
00:31:30,376 --> 00:31:31,750
That's the
biophysical principle.

659
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,500
Very simple.

660
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:36,430
Stronger earlier, weaker later.

661
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:39,510
That will give you this
phase precession property.

662
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:41,800
Phase precession,
you might think

663
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,110
of as this
biophysical curiosity.

664
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,850
But when you think
about how that

665
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:49,060
would apply when you have more
than one place cell-- in fact,

666
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:53,140
I have two place cells here,
one in blue, one here in purple,

667
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:56,270
where place cell one is to
the left of place cell two.

668
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,920
So as the animal's
going through here,

669
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,880
first the blue cell will fire,
and then, the purple cell

670
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,900
will fire.

671
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,700
And if you look
at the excitatory

672
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:08,960
drive, shown here as a ramp
in blue, ramp in purple,

673
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,750
and now you ask,
"When is the blue cell

674
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:13,420
going to fire, and the
purple going to fire,

675
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:16,407
during each one of these
oscillatory cycles?"

676
00:32:16,407 --> 00:32:18,490
The answer will be, well,
because the blue's-- the

677
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:21,799
excitatory drives the blue cells
higher than the purple cell,

678
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:23,590
blue is always going
to fire before purple.

679
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:25,960
In fact, in each
and every cycle,

680
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,360
it will be blue purple
blue purple blue purple.

681
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:32,530
So this principle
of phase precession,

682
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:35,590
or phase coding,
for single cells,

683
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:39,490
actually gives you sequential
encoding across a population

684
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:41,800
that you will actually
on each and every cycle

685
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,360
have a sequence.

686
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,520
The code in the hippocampus
is not a location,

687
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:49,360
it's actually a
sequence, a trajectory.

688
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,860
This is just raw
data, but I'm going

689
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,240
to quickly go-- this is
just talking about what

690
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,330
the spiking looks like.

691
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:54,788
And you can see,
if you look at it,

692
00:32:54,788 --> 00:32:57,490
you see these spike sequences.

693
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:00,100
But the property's more
clearly demonstrated

694
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,780
when I do this decoding.

695
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,650
So what I'm showing you here--

696
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:04,720
this is, again, raw data.

697
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,386
But now, instead of
showing the spiking,

698
00:33:06,386 --> 00:33:08,290
I'm showing you that
the result of doing

699
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:11,530
this decoding, this Bayesian
decoding, where there's

700
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:15,550
a probability estimate
that given spiking activity

701
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:18,190
in each one of a
set of successive 20

702
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:20,560
millisecond windows--

703
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,900
so I'm walking
along, now I'm firing

704
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,630
at a finer temporal resolution
every 20 milliseconds.

705
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:27,580
I'm doing the same
decoding, probability

706
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:30,562
is indicated in grayscale.

707
00:33:30,562 --> 00:33:32,020
So you can see here
the dark areas,

708
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,147
this is high probability
that this pattern--

709
00:33:34,147 --> 00:33:35,980
the animal would have
been in this location,

710
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,780
or to get this
pattern of activity

711
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,240
in this 20 millisecond bin.

712
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,560
And so, what you can see
here is that the probability,

713
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,610
these Bayesian
decoded probabilities,

714
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:49,630
form short sequences
every single theta cycle,

715
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:51,460
what we refer to
as theta sequences.

716
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:54,130
And the theta sequences
actually move from just

717
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:55,267
behind the animal--

718
00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:57,100
dotted line is where
the animal actually is.

719
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,200
The estimate goes from just
behind the animal to just

720
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,158
in front of the animal.

721
00:34:00,158 --> 00:34:02,710
So 10 times a second
the hippocampus

722
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:05,530
is actually expressing
a representation

723
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:08,707
of spatial sequence
that goes from behind

724
00:34:08,707 --> 00:34:09,790
to in front of the animal.

725
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:11,560
You can think of
behind and in front

726
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:16,070
as also reflecting recent
past and near future.

727
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:24,190
So there is this relative
predictive differentiation

728
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:28,610
of response as a function
of oscillatory phase.

729
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:31,540
So if I want to look at, "Gee,
where did I just come from?"

730
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:34,540
I just have to look
at activity here,

731
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,909
at this slightly earlier phase.

732
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:39,730
If I want to ask the question,
"Gee, where am I likely to go

733
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:41,040
to?"

734
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,449
I simply have to shift the
phase, the channel that I

735
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:45,520
look at here, and
I can see where

736
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,989
the likely future location is.

737
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:50,260
So you can think that
there is actually a code,

738
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:55,929
not just of location, but of
the relative causal relationship

739
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:58,794
between locations
mapped into phase.

740
00:34:58,794 --> 00:35:00,460
And we'll see that
we can experimentally

741
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:03,400
test this idea,
that that's just not

742
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,420
an artifact of our decoding,
but the animals are actually

743
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:11,680
using information of
these different phases

744
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:16,810
to drive spatial navigation
in particular ways

745
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:20,680
by using some of the tools
for manipulating activity

746
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,560
in a closed loop optogenetics.

747
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,050
So we see we can manipulate
activity, specifically

748
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:28,660
manipulate activity, hippocampal
activity, different phases

749
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,880
and show these different
phases actually

750
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,380
carry different
functional consequences.

751
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,120
So we've got these sequences.

752
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,730
So we've got these
sequences captured

753
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:38,560
during these oscillations.

754
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,210
Are these things
actually meaningful?

755
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:42,160
Well, some of the
indications that,

756
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,840
A, the oscillations in the
sequences are meaningful

757
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:48,050
first come from the observation
that, as I mentioned,

758
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:49,582
actually successful,
using memory--

759
00:35:49,582 --> 00:35:52,040
information that the hippocampus
requires that you actually

760
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,530
communicate this to
executive structures

761
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:56,662
that can guide behavior,
make decisions.

762
00:35:56,662 --> 00:35:58,370
That would include
the prefrontal cortex.

763
00:35:58,370 --> 00:36:01,620
The portion of the
prefrontal cortex,

764
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,640
which form part of
this limbic circuit,

765
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:07,770
referred to as the
limbic prefrontal cortex,

766
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:12,240
which have direct connections
from the hippocampus.

767
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,990
These structures are--
in the hippocampus,

768
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:16,940
you have deficits in
spatial learning memory.

769
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:22,370
Prefrontal cortex-- you
think of this as deficits

770
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:24,770
in working memory and
retrieval, executive control,

771
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:27,020
decision-making.

772
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:32,270
But you can think of these two
things as working together.

773
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:36,770
Hippocampus
providing information

774
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:40,520
that the prefrontal cortex can
use in order to direct behavior

775
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,425
and decision-making.

776
00:36:41,425 --> 00:36:43,550
And you damage either one
of these things, animals,

777
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:45,341
rats can't find their
way around the space.

778
00:36:45,341 --> 00:36:47,490
You damage either one
of these in humans,

779
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:50,840
you're going to get
memory deficits.

780
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,870
Dementia is-- when you think
of dementia as being problems

781
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:57,410
of cognition and memory, you
can get them temporal lobe

782
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:00,320
dementias, frontal lobe
dementias, you can have--

783
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:07,830
they're really very
closely related.

784
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:10,810
And so we can look
at a simple task.

785
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:13,420
This is a simple task, testing
a so-called working memory.

786
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,060
Just remember, what
did you do last?

787
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,630
And this task, it's just
a simple alternation,

788
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:18,950
where you turn left--

789
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:21,140
first time you turn left,
next time to go right.

790
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,970
Ethologically, it's
like, "Look, I just

791
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:26,290
got food over here, why don't
I check out the other place?

792
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:29,790
I'll check out places
where I didn't get food."

793
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:31,880
It's a so-called
win-shift strategy.

794
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:35,150
I got something here this time,
I'm going to go someplace else.

795
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:38,510
As opposed to-- a
reference memory strategy

796
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:40,880
would be referred
to as a win-stay.

797
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,000
That's really a good spot.

798
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,310
Home.

799
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:47,942
I love going home because I've
got my TV, I got my microwave,

800
00:37:47,942 --> 00:37:49,400
I'm going to stick
with that place.

801
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,564
Win-stay, you keep going back
to the place that rewards you.

802
00:37:52,564 --> 00:37:54,980
And so you can think of both--
again, both of these things

803
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,450
have ethological value.

804
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:58,460
Home is a good place,
that's a reference place.

805
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:01,430
If you're foraging,
win-shift, don't go back

806
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:02,990
to the place I
just looted, right?

807
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:10,250
Again, these two structures--

808
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:16,330
classically, you think of--
in the prefrontal cortex we

809
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:17,990
think of working memory cells.

810
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:20,460
And this is the short term,
the idea of short term memory.

811
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,920
So prefrontal
cortex typically has

812
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,960
been thought of as subservient.

813
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,790
Working memory,
where working memory

814
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:29,540
is about holding information
over short delays.

815
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:34,006
It's an overlap in
terminology, where

816
00:38:34,006 --> 00:38:35,630
working memory in
the prefrontal cortex

817
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:37,610
is really thinking about time.

818
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:39,290
Working memory in
hippocampus is really

819
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:43,460
thinking about the context
in which it's used,

820
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:47,600
relative, session specific
information, trial

821
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,933
specific information.

822
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,100
So I'm not going to go
through the details.

823
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,225
You have these two systems.

824
00:38:57,570 --> 00:39:00,450
One interesting property, if
you look at these two systems

825
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:04,140
simultaneously, what you
find is that the same idea

826
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:08,515
about oscillatory phase
governing the firing of cells

827
00:39:08,515 --> 00:39:10,890
in the hippocampus also applies
in the prefrontal cortex.

828
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,900
That is, cells in
the prefrontal cortex

829
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,450
like to fire at a certain
phase of the hippocampal theta

830
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:15,950
rhythm.

831
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:19,560
They care about,
their listening to,

832
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,980
this rhythm in the hippocampus.

833
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:25,060
And so, we can look at a task.

834
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,775
This is basically the
same kind of task,

835
00:39:26,775 --> 00:39:28,400
only now there's a
back-to-back T-maze.

836
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,191
So there can be two
T-mazes, and we're just

837
00:39:30,191 --> 00:39:33,680
going to do a simple
variation on that,

838
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:40,961
on that working memory
task, in which the animal's

839
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:42,460
going to start from
one of these two

840
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,180
arms-- it's going to
walk down this arm

841
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:48,700
and then, it has to go to the
arm that's on the same side

842
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,760
as it started from.

843
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,540
So it has to remember,
"Where did I start from?

844
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,150
Oh, that's the side
I have to go to."

845
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:55,650
Then it's going to
turn around, it's

846
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:57,186
going to come back,
run down here,

847
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:59,560
and then, we're going to force
it into one of these arms.

848
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:02,800
So two back-to-back T-mazes.

849
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,560
In this direction, the animal
chooses, in this direction,

850
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,545
we choose.

851
00:40:07,545 --> 00:40:10,030
In this direction, there's
a working memory demand.

852
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,900
It has to remember
where it came from.

853
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,230
In this direction, doesn't
have to remember anything,

854
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,396
doesn't make any difference.

855
00:40:15,396 --> 00:40:19,060
So behaviorally, it's symmetric,
but cognitively, here there's

856
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:21,310
a working memory demand,
here there's not.

857
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:24,610
And then we're going to look at
all these things, oscillations,

858
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:31,320
spiking, and the oscillations,
look at the peak time,

859
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,450
look at the firing with
respect to that, firing,

860
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:39,220
spiking, as a function of this
oscillation in both structures.

861
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:42,520
The bottom line is
what you find is,

862
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:47,680
that this is a measure
of relative phase locking

863
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:55,180
and as how well do
prefrontal cells actually

864
00:40:55,180 --> 00:41:00,100
lock to this data oscillation.

865
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,775
And what you find is that the
degree to which they locked

866
00:41:02,775 --> 00:41:06,730
the theta rhythm is a function
of whether or not the animal

867
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:08,030
has to choose.

868
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:10,812
So the red ones are when the
animal's going down the arm

869
00:41:10,812 --> 00:41:11,770
and it's got to choose.

870
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:15,710
The gray one is when it doesn't
have to choose, when we choose.

871
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:18,910
Then in addition,
the solid red is

872
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:23,560
when the animal had to
choose and it got it right.

873
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,690
And the stipple red is
when it had to choose

874
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,190
and it got it wrong.

875
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:30,940
So the degree to which the
prefrontal cortex actually

876
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:35,290
locks, successfully locks, to
the hippocampal theta rhythm,

877
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:37,360
predicts whether the
animal actually makes

878
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,530
the correct choice or not.

879
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:41,620
So it's as though
this is a channel that

880
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:45,340
is necessary for effectively
communicating information

881
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:48,190
between the two structures.

882
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:54,760
And, that not only is it in
the blocking of the spikes,

883
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,980
spikes in the prefrontal cortex,
the rhythm in the hippocampus,

884
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:00,580
it also comes in the blocking
of the rhythms themselves.

885
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:02,320
So you can think
of there being--

886
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:06,070
this is the theta
rhythm that you

887
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:09,260
can detect in the prefrontal
cortex and in the hippocampus.

888
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,470
And what you can see is
there are two conditions.

889
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:14,230
One, the animal's actually
choosing, is running down here,

890
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:15,244
it's making a choice.

891
00:42:15,244 --> 00:42:17,410
And in about the half second
before the animal makes

892
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:20,050
a choice, you see these
two rhythms actually

893
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:21,820
lock, they become coherent.

894
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:26,530
So transient coherence
is predictive

895
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:30,040
of correct choice behavior.

896
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,910
The thinking is that
the rhythms themselves

897
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:36,970
can be generating coordinated
through the regulation

898
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:38,810
of these local
inhibitory circuits.

899
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:41,060
In fact, there's been a lot
of interest, for instance,

900
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:45,130
in the relationship
of local inhibitory

901
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:49,550
control and neuropsychiatric
disease and disorders.

902
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:53,170
So, for instance, disrupting
local inhibitory rhythms.

903
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:54,700
In particular,
some, for instance,

904
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:58,300
the theta rhythms
in prefrontal cortex

905
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,729
can be associated with
disorders like schizophrenia,

906
00:43:00,729 --> 00:43:01,270
for instance.

907
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:04,840
So the inability to
effectively impose these modes

908
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:09,820
and then synchronize these
modes can introduce disruptions

909
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:13,900
in the ability to
communicate or use memory.

910
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:16,390
Cognitive disruption
coming through disruption

911
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:21,670
of these oscillations through
disruption of inhibition

912
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:23,110
in these local circuits.

913
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:28,900
Now how you actually coordinate
these two subjective states.

914
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:33,710
We've been looking at the role
of mid-line thalamic nuclei.

915
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:36,820
So the thalamus as being
a set of structures

916
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:39,010
that have widespread
connectivity to all

917
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:43,030
these cortical areas, that
much of their connectivity

918
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:45,970
is inhibitory, and so they
have the ability to actually

919
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:51,640
coordinate, modulate and
coordinate, these oscillatory

920
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:52,570
modes.

921
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:57,230
We've even just recently
published on individual cells

922
00:43:57,230 --> 00:43:59,410
we found in some of these
mid-line thalamic nuclei

923
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:02,050
that, for instance, will branch.

924
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:04,390
Single cells will
branch and target cells

925
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:06,300
in the hippocampus and
the prefrontal cortex.

926
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,470
So they would be
ideally positioned

927
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:11,380
to introduce, to
select and impose,

928
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:13,780
this synchronization there.

929
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:17,590
So that's the way
we think about a lot

930
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:20,980
of this dynamic connectivity
being established,

931
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:24,610
presumably through some
sort of thalamic regulation.

932
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:26,470
And then, you think
about the thalamus

933
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:30,430
as being regulated by those
so-called thalamic reticular

934
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:33,430
nucleus that
regulates the thalamus

935
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:35,164
and it sets up these modes.

936
00:44:35,164 --> 00:44:36,580
And there's also
a lot of interest

937
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:39,490
now in the thalamic
reticular nucleus

938
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:41,560
in disease and disorders.

939
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:45,250
A lot of the genetic
screening has

940
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:49,527
identified targets in the
thalamic reticular nucleus.

941
00:44:49,527 --> 00:44:50,860
So you can think about it again.

942
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:58,930
It's like the oscillator in
your computer or your radio that

943
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:01,210
breaks down, you can't--

944
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:03,667
the information can be there,
but you can't tune into it.

945
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:05,000
So it's this fundamental tuning.

946
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,100
You've got to have
the modes and you've

947
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,990
got to be able to lock
to these frequencies.

948
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:10,180
And then, beyond
that, as we'll see,

949
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:12,760
it's not just the
frequencies, but it's also

950
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:16,334
the precise phase within
those oscillatory modes that

951
00:45:16,334 --> 00:45:17,500
carry different information.

952
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:21,220
That we actually determine
by taking advantage

953
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:24,130
of these techniques,
optogenetic techniques,

954
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:25,760
for targeted manipulation.

955
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,420
So you infect the
inhibitory neurons

956
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:32,980
in the hippocampus with
this optogenetically

957
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:39,880
encoded and controllable
channel so that we can optically

958
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:42,760
excite inhibitory cells.

959
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:47,660
So we infect this excitatory
channel into inhibitory cells,

960
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:50,860
and then, we can transiently,
giving very brief pulses

961
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:55,840
of laser light, we can activate
drive, inhibitory cells,

962
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,610
and then, because
the local circuit,

963
00:45:57,610 --> 00:46:01,160
those inhibitory cells will
inhibit the excitatory cells.

964
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:05,530
And so we have about
20-25 millisecond control.

965
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:12,580
And now, we can
lock, or control,

966
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:16,370
inhibition based upon the
phase of this oscillation.

967
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:19,570
So the idea is, we're
going to selectively

968
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:22,780
disrupt, or inactivate,
the hippocampus

969
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,520
at different phases.

970
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:27,430
We're going to ask,
"Do those phases,

971
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:30,820
do they differ in terms
of their contribution

972
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:32,960
to behavior and performance?"

973
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,590
So here, we're going
to lock inhibition

974
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:38,470
to either the peak of the trough
of this state of oscillation.

975
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:40,490
And so in this task--

976
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:43,090
and we're going to do this
manipulation, that is,

977
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:44,175
selectively inhibit--

978
00:46:44,175 --> 00:46:45,550
you're picking
hippocampal output

979
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:47,675
at either the peak of the
trough, the theta rhythm,

980
00:46:47,675 --> 00:46:49,027
at two behavioral phases.

981
00:46:49,027 --> 00:46:51,610
So in this task, animal's going
to start on one of these arms,

982
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:53,700
going to run up, and
it's going to choose.

983
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:57,360
So we're going to think
about the starting arms as--

984
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,110
we'll refer to this
as the encoding phase.

985
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:01,190
This is where you have to
keep track of where you are.

986
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:02,759
And then, here in
the central arm--

987
00:47:02,759 --> 00:47:04,550
we'll refer to this as
the retrieval phase.

988
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:05,390
This is where you
have to remember,

989
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:06,680
"Oh, where did I come from?"

990
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:10,950
And then use that to decide
where you're going to go to.

991
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:12,860
And what we found was
pretty surprising.

992
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:16,940
And that is that, you
might think, well,

993
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:19,400
if you shut off hippocampal
output, turn off

994
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,770
the hippocampus, you're
going to get an impairment.

995
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:23,810
It's just like in
the examples that I

996
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:26,355
gave of suggesting
hippocampal's prefrontal cortex.

997
00:47:26,355 --> 00:47:27,980
Most of those come
from lesion studies.

998
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:29,300
You damage the
hippocampus, the animal

999
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:30,390
can't find its way around.

1000
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:34,010
So if you were to optogentically
lesion, or turn off

1001
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:35,910
the hippocampus,
you might imagine,

1002
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:39,570
OK, animals won't be able
to find a way around.

1003
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:42,350
So you could ask,
"This experiment

1004
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:50,030
is going to identify which
phase, which behavioral phase,

1005
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:53,300
are most effective in
disrupting performance?"

1006
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:57,440
But what we actually found
was, when you selectively

1007
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,442
inhibit activity at
different phases,

1008
00:47:59,442 --> 00:48:01,400
you actually get an
enhancement of performance.

1009
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,870
They get better.

1010
00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:05,330
And it depended--
there wasn't just

1011
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:07,490
one phase, a good
phase and a bad phase,

1012
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:09,610
but both at the
peak and the trough

1013
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:12,920
were both effective in
enhancing performance,

1014
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:16,820
but only when applied at
certain behavioral phases.

1015
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:19,370
In fact, there was this
double dissociation.

1016
00:48:19,370 --> 00:48:23,360
And that is, that
trough stimulation,

1017
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,040
when applied here--

1018
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:30,210
so when you stimulate
in the trough,

1019
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:33,410
in the retrieval segment,
animals got better.

1020
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:37,160
When you stimulate at the
peak, in the encoding segment,

1021
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,990
animals got better.

1022
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:41,430
So it wasn't that the peak is
good or the trough as good,

1023
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:43,910
it's the peak.

1024
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:48,110
The peak is good
during retrieval

1025
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:50,930
and the trough is
good during encoding.

1026
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:53,090
So what it says is,
the peak and the trough

1027
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:55,624
had two different functions.

1028
00:48:55,624 --> 00:48:58,040
And if you actually think about
what I was showing before,

1029
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:59,584
these sequences,
these sequences that

1030
00:48:59,584 --> 00:49:02,000
are going from just behind to
just in front of the animal.

1031
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,400
What it says is, oh yeah,
these different phases, peak

1032
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,790
and trough, you can think
of as like past and future.

1033
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:13,100
And so if I'm sitting over here
in this encoding segment, what

1034
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:14,870
I'm really trying
to do is I'm just

1035
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:17,570
trying to keep track of
where am I right now.

1036
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:20,030
Now, I may simultaneously
also be thinking about, oh,

1037
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:21,860
where am I going to go?

1038
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:24,472
But for this task, it's
not really helpful.

1039
00:49:24,472 --> 00:49:25,430
It's not really useful.

1040
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:29,152
At this point, I need to
focus on where I am right now.

1041
00:49:29,152 --> 00:49:30,610
So you can think
of simultaneously,

1042
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:32,180
the actions of
these two channels,

1043
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:34,310
where am I, where
am I going to go.

1044
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:38,690
And I can enhance performance
by shutting off or inhibiting

1045
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:40,490
the non-relevant one.

1046
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:44,150
So when I shut off the retrieval
channel here in the encoding,

1047
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:44,710
I get better.

1048
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:45,940
It's like focusing attention.

1049
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:48,290
It's like, pay attention
to what you're doing now.

1050
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:51,210
Stop thinking about stuff.

1051
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:54,230
Similarly, when I'm here
in the retrieval segment,

1052
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:55,020
I'm also encoding.

1053
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:57,980
I'm trying to keep track of
where I am as well as, think

1054
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:59,180
about where I'm going to.

1055
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:02,810
The thing is, keeping
track of where I am here,

1056
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:05,180
it's not relevant for the task.

1057
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:07,062
It might be broadly
relevant for the animal,

1058
00:50:07,062 --> 00:50:08,520
but it's not relevant
for the task.

1059
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:12,400
So when I shut off, I turn
off that encoding channel,

1060
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:17,420
I'm able to enhance the
retrieval information that

1061
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:17,920
goes out.

1062
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:22,340
You might interpret
this saying, "Oh,

1063
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:25,250
so this is how we can improve
memory by selectively shutting

1064
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:26,150
off the hippocampus."

1065
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:30,770
Well, this is not a strategy for
general cognitive enhancement.

1066
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:33,890
Hippocampus is working much
better when all these phases

1067
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:35,062
are in operation.

1068
00:50:35,062 --> 00:50:36,770
And that's because
the hippocampus is not

1069
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:39,260
designed to solve this task.

1070
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:41,720
Hippocampus is designed
to solve the broader task.

1071
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:45,690
It's trying to figure out how
is this task relevant to all

1072
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:47,149
the other things
that I have to do?

1073
00:50:47,149 --> 00:50:49,606
In other words, you're trying
to integrate this information

1074
00:50:49,606 --> 00:50:51,500
into all the other
information you have.

1075
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:55,714
And that requires connecting
the encoding or retrieval.

1076
00:50:55,714 --> 00:50:58,130
You really need to have all
of those pieces of information

1077
00:50:58,130 --> 00:50:59,600
available.

1078
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:02,780
But it does point out
that one can actually

1079
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:04,790
dissociate the
function of information

1080
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:06,380
of these two different phases.

1081
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:08,130
The phase actually matters.

1082
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:09,950
And it matters at the
level of high level

1083
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:11,670
behavior, decision-making.

1084
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:17,030
It's not just a idiosyncrasy
or artifact of--

1085
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:19,730
excitability is a
function of phase.

1086
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:22,259
This is really how
information is being used.
