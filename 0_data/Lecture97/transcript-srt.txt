 welcome to this afternoon's tutorial on

24
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,830
 

25
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:15,630
 counterfactual inference it's a great

26
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,630
 

27
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,520
 pleasure to introduce professor Susan

28
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,520

34
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,880
 

35
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:25,650
 previously taught the economics

36
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,650
 

37
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,410

00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,410
 

39
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:32,130
 she's had many awards and accolades and

40
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,130
 

41
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:34,110
 I won't cut into her time by by telling

42
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,110
 

43
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:35,910
 you about all of those but she was

44
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,910
 

45
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:38,970
 elected to the American Academy of Arts

46
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,970
 

47
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:42,990

49
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:45,930
 Academy of Sciences in 2012 her research

50
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,930
 

51
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:48,750
 focuses on economics of the Internet

52
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,750
 

53
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:51,600
 online advertising the news media

54
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,600
 

55
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:53,460
 marketplace design virtual currencies

56
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,460
 

57
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,350
 and the intersection of computer science

58
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,350
 

59
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,600
 machine learning in economics and I

60
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,600
 

61
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:59,430
 think there's a lot of interest in in

62
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,430
 

63
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,750
 causality and counterfactuals

64
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,750
 

65
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:03,060
 researchers it's great to have her here

66
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,060
 

67
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:06,000
 just before we start there are there are

68
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:06,000
 

69
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:07,800
 two things we need to handle

70
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,800
 

71
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,530
 administratively one is that there will

72
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,530
 

73
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,210
 be a break at about 55 minutes so it'll

74
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,210
 

75
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:14,460
 be a ten minute break then and we'll

76
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,460
 

77
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:16,980
 want you to come back afterwards and the

78
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,980
 

79
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:19,380
 other one is that I think that it's

80
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,380
 

81
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:21,480
 probably best if we leave the questions

82
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,480
 

83
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:23,220
 to the end just and by the way when

84
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,220
 

85
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,050
 there are questions we'll have to use

86
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,050
 

87
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:29,130
 the microphones here cuz this is a large

88
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,130
 

89
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:32,480
 room but I guess I'll let Susan well get

90
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,480
 

91
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:32,480
 on with her tutorial and also

92
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:38,880
 

93
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:43,610
 so thank you so much for having me here

94
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,610
 

95
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,010
 it's a real honor to be able to give the

96
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,010
 

97
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:49,040
 tutorial to such a terrific and large

98
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,040
 

99
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:51,200
 audience one of the things that I'm

100
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,200
 

101
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,120
 finding as I'm going out and speaking

102
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:53,120
 

103
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,730
 about this topic is that in some ways

104
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,730
 

105
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,590
 it's gotten harder to give tutorials and

106
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,590
 

107
00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:00,550
 lectures over the last few years because

108
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,550
 

109
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:04,220
 when I started working on this topic

110
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:04,220
 

111
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:05,900
 maybe eight years ago from a

112
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,900
 

113
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:08,360
 machine-learning perspective there was a

114
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,360
 

115
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,920
 sense that only a very small part of the

116
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,920
 

117
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,720
 machine learning community was really

118
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,720
 

119
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,400
 thinking about counterfactual inference

120
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,400
 

121
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,310
 or really even thinking about the words

122
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:16,310
 

123
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,810
 and very little of the economics and

124
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,810
 

125
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,880
 social science community was thinking

126
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,880
 

127
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:21,320
 about machine learning so if I went to

128
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,320
 

129
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,910
 an audience that was mostly one or

130
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,910
 

131
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,010
 mostly the other I could pretty much

132
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,010
 

133
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:26,390
 count on people knowing a lot about one

134
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,390
 

135
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:28,430
 thing and not so much about the other

136
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,430
 

137
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:30,320
 one of the really exciting things that's

138
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,320
 

139
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:32,000
 happening now is that a lot of these

140
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,000
 

141
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:35,360
 literature's are coming together and

142
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:35,360
 

143
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,610
 there's a lot more interest and

144
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,610
 

145
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,800
 knowledge out there so today I'm gonna

146
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,800
 

147
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:41,600
 try to do my best to kind of hit a

148
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,600
 

149
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,060
 little bit of both worlds I'm gonna

150
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:44,060
 

151
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,010
 start from the beginning and talk at a

152
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:46,010
 

153
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:48,050
 high level to people who aren't that

154
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,050
 

155
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:49,160
 familiar with the topic because I hope

156
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,160
 

157
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:51,440
 some people have come out because

158
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,440
 

159
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:53,990
 they're curious I'm also gonna try to

160
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,990
 

161
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,090
 give some insights to the more advanced

162
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:56,090
 

163
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:57,260
 folks and we'll see we'll see how that

164
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,260
 

165
00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:00,290
 goes

166
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,290
 

167
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:02,600
 one thing if you're interested in more I

168
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,600
 

169
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:05,030
 should say I did I haven't given that

170
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:05,030
 

171
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,650
 many references throughout my slides but

172
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,650
 

173
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:08,870
 then when I post them all have some

174
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,870
 

175
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:11,390
 references at the end but just for those

176
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,390
 

177
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:14,480
 who are interested I did a two-day

178
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,480
 

179
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:16,190
 lecture series for the American Economic

180
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,190
 

181
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:19,730
 Association and there's videos and

182
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,730
 

183
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:21,560
 slides available as well as two days of

184
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,560
 

185
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:24,200
 lecture notes from a much longer

186
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:24,200
 

187
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,660
 tutorial I also have links to several

188
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:26,660
 

189
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,310
 survey papers there and so on so if

190
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,310
 

191
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:31,280
 you're interested please you can google

192
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,280
 

193
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:33,680
 Susan Athey AEA that's American Economic

194
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,680
 

195
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,500
 Association and you'll find that all

196
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:36,500
 

197
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:39,220
 that material there and would love to

198
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:39,220
 

199
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:42,950
 answer any questions via email as well

200
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:42,950
 

201
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:45,590
 so I've been working myself on using

202
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,590
 

203
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:49,000
 data to answer counterfactual questions

204
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:49,000
 

205
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:50,800
 for most of my career I started working

206
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,800
 

207
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,350
 Auctions actually I started working on

208
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:56,350
 

209
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:59,500
 auctions when I was about 17 in in 1987

210
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,500
 

211
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:01,420
 and I was an undergraduate at that time

212
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:01,420
 

213
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,730
 nobody really cared about auctions and

214
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,730
 

215
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:06,130
 we were even in economics we were

216
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,130
 

217
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:08,740
 relatively early in using data to do

218
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,740
 

219
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:12,310
 counterfactual estimation and that was a

220
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:12,310
 

221
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:16,360
 very exciting time I came only to

222
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,360
 

223
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:18,910
 machine learning in around 2007 and 2008

224
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,910
 

225
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,740
 when I went to work as consulting chief

226
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,740
 

227
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:22,240
 economist for Microsoft for a few years

228
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,240
 

229
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:24,280
 and particularly focused on the Bing

230
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,280
 

231
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,800
 search engine and there I met a

232
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,800
 

233
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,210
 fantastic set of collaborators from the

234
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,210
 

235
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,920
 machine learning community from

236
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,920
 

237
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:31,750
 Microsoft Research the engineers

238
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,750
 

239
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,940
 building the search engine and so on and

240
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,940
 

241
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:36,250
 one of the really interesting things

242
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:36,250
 

243
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:38,470
 that I encountered was that I felt like

244
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,470
 

245
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:40,720
 we were actually needing to solve a lot

246
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,720
 

247
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:41,950
 of counterfactual problems yet a lot of

248
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,950
 

249
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,600
 the folks from the machine learning

250
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,600
 

251
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:45,910
 community didn't really have a good

252
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,910
 

253
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,830
 language to talk about that and so at

254
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,830
 

255
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:50,680
 the beginning we had a lot of sort of

256
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,680
 

257
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:52,690
 culture clashes of people insisting that

258
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,690
 

259
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,130
 you know one thing was possible or I

260
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,130
 

261
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:56,589
 said well I thought that was impossible

262
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,589
 

263
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:58,060
 without running an experiment and you

264
00:09:56,579 --> 00:09:58,060
 

265
00:09:56,589 --> 00:10:00,490
 know we had a lot we had difficulties

266
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,490
 

267
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:03,070
 sort of communicating but then that that

268
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,070
 

269
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:06,130
 those early debates and interactions

270
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,130
 

271
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:07,780
 really bore fruit later as they really

272
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,780
 

273
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:09,820
 working with some of these smartest

274
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,820
 

275
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:11,650
 people in the world all attacking an

276
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,650
 

277
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,310
 applied problem and really trying to get

278
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,310
 

279
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,990
 to answers

280
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,990
 

281
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:16,750
 helped us I think all learn from each

282
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,750
 

283
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:19,900
 other and it really embarked me on a new

284
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,900
 

285
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:21,880
 research agenda I had been more of an on

286
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,880
 

287
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:24,760
 the applied side really using data to

288
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,760
 

289
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,500
 help make decisions and and to do

290
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,500
 

291
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,930
 counterfactual estimation for specific

292
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,930
 

293
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:31,690
 problems but I felt like this whole area

294
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,690
 

295
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:33,550
 was just so wide open that there wasn't

296
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,550
 

297
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:35,560
 you know like many of you as well you

298
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,560
 

299
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:37,780
 know you the the world changed and we

300
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,780
 

301
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,430
 all dropped everything to come and think

302
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,430
 

303
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:41,110
 about machine learning and in my case

304
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,110
 

305
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:43,270
 the intersection of machine learning and

306
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,270
 

307
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:45,460
 causal inference and this has gone from

308
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,460
 

309
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:47,110
 being a very small literature to really

310
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,110
 

311
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:49,750
 a much bigger literature in the last few

312
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,750
 

313
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:51,850
 years it's growing very quickly and so

314
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,850
 

315
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:55,030
 even my survey of a year ago already is

316
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,030
 

317
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:57,100
 is getting out of date so let me start

318
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,100
 

319
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,890
 with a big motivation for people who

320
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,890
 

321
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:02,170
 think about artificial intelligence

322
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,170
 

323
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:02,649
 broadly and I want to talk about really

324
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,649
 

325
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:05,230
 two

326
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:05,230
 

327
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:06,910
 sets of issues that I think make sort of

328
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,910
 

329
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:10,540
 causal inference counterfactual

330
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,540
 

331
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:13,540
 reasoning kind of must know must

332
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:13,540
 

333
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:17,110
 understand concepts for artificial

334
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:17,110
 

335
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:19,749
 intelligence the first is that you know

336
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,749
 

337
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:22,899
 we've we are all are seeing that there

338
00:11:19,739 --> 00:11:22,899
 

339
00:11:19,749 --> 00:11:24,879
 are some you know gaps between what

340
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:24,879
 

341
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:27,129
 we're doing in our research and what

342
00:11:24,869 --> 00:11:27,129
 

343
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:29,350
 firms are applying and of course there's

344
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,350
 

345
00:11:27,129 --> 00:11:31,629
 all these amazing success stories of you

346
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,629
 

347
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:33,759
 know Google Images and so on but

348
00:11:31,619 --> 00:11:33,759
 

349
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:37,629
 actually even at the top tech companies

350
00:11:33,749 --> 00:11:37,629
 

351
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:39,369
 there's maybe less adoption of machine

352
00:11:37,619 --> 00:11:39,369
 

353
00:11:37,629 --> 00:11:42,129
 learning and artificial intelligence in

354
00:11:39,359 --> 00:11:42,129
 

355
00:11:39,369 --> 00:11:43,540
 in some systems and you'd expect given

356
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:43,540
 

357
00:11:42,129 --> 00:11:46,749
 that like all the people there are

358
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:46,749
 

359
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:48,069
 inventing it and and embrace it and so

360
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:48,069
 

361
00:11:46,749 --> 00:11:50,709
 when we think about some of the

362
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:50,709
 

363
00:11:48,069 --> 00:11:51,819
 impediments to adopting machine learning

364
00:11:50,699 --> 00:11:51,819
 

365
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:53,860
 and artificial intelligence and

366
00:11:51,809 --> 00:11:53,860
 

367
00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:55,899
 applications there's a whole sort of

368
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,899
 

369
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:58,029
 grab-bag of issues and each of these

370
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:58,029
 

371
00:11:55,899 --> 00:12:00,910
 issues is the subject of tutorials and

372
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:00,910
 

373
00:11:58,029 --> 00:12:03,459
 workshops in and of themselves but to me

374
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,459
 

375
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:05,319
 they're all pretty interrelated so we

376
00:12:03,449 --> 00:12:05,319
 

377
00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:08,860
 typically you know for firm is going to

378
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:08,860
 

379
00:12:05,319 --> 00:12:11,079
 dump their old simple regression credit

380
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:11,079
 

381
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,879
 scoring model and put in one based on a

382
00:12:11,069 --> 00:12:12,879
 

383
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:15,040
 black box machine learning algorithm for

384
00:12:12,869 --> 00:12:15,040
 

385
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:17,589
 example they're gonna have some

386
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:17,589
 

387
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,779
 reservations they're gonna worry about

388
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:19,779
 

389
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:22,660
 what happens when they use a black box

390
00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:22,660
 

391
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:24,550
 algorithm first thing that comes up is

392
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,550
 

393
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:26,709
 well is this interpretable how would I

394
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,709
 

395
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:29,860
 understand you know if it was working

396
00:12:26,699 --> 00:12:29,860
 

397
00:12:26,709 --> 00:12:31,300
 and why it was working and and you might

398
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,300
 

399
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,800
 say well why do they need to understand

400
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,800
 

401
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,839
 it well because they're gonna make

402
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,839
 

403
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:38,019
 decisions and actually it might take

404
00:12:34,829 --> 00:12:38,019
 

405
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:40,029
 five years for the loans to be repaid or

406
00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:40,029
 

407
00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:42,009
 not repaid so it's going to take some

408
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:42,009
 

409
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:45,069
 time to really get feedback on whether

410
00:12:41,999 --> 00:12:45,069
 

411
00:12:42,009 --> 00:12:48,220
 they work and so one reason that firms

412
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:48,220
 

413
00:12:45,069 --> 00:12:50,709
 and economists historically use very

414
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,709
 

415
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:52,149
 simple models is that we were trying to

416
00:12:50,699 --> 00:12:52,149
 

417
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:54,309
 come up with things that we could

418
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:54,309
 

419
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:56,799
 understand because we were typically in

420
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:56,799
 

421
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:58,299
 a data poor environment and were in an

422
00:12:56,789 --> 00:12:58,299
 

423
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:00,490
 environment where it was pretty hard to

424
00:12:58,289 --> 00:13:00,490
 

425
00:12:58,299 --> 00:13:02,079
 know just by looking at the data whether

426
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,079
 

427
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:04,269
 we were right or wrong and so

428
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:04,269
 

429
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,459
 something's interpretable you can reason

430
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:06,459
 

431
00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:08,829
 about it you can actually if you were an

432
00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:08,829
 

433
00:13:06,459 --> 00:13:10,660
 applied economist what what you would do

434
00:13:08,819 --> 00:13:10,660
 

435
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:12,790
 with a research paper an empirical paper

436
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,790
 

437
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:14,920
 you guys will be really amazed by this

438
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,920
 

439
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:15,750
 but we would often spend four or five

440
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:15,750
 

441
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,030
 years getting

442
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:18,030
 

443
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:20,700
 empirical paper published and we might

444
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,700
 

445
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:22,470
 present it 25 times and sit in a room of

446
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,470
 

447
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,270
 smart people for an hour and a half and

448
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,270
 

449
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:26,160
 everybody would beat up our models and

450
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,160
 

451
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:28,620
 try to reason about whether they made

452
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,620
 

453
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,290
 sense and then we would improve them and

454
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:31,290
 

455
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:33,420
 you know think about implications and in

456
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,420
 

457
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:35,040
 this edge case and that's edge case what

458
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,040
 

459
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:38,220
 would the model say to see if they were

460
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:38,220
 

461
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:41,550
 reasonable and so there's that that kind

462
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:41,550
 

463
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:44,820
 of reasoning is harder to do in a black

464
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:44,820
 

465
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:47,280
 box closely related to that are issues

466
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:47,280
 

467
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:49,980
 of stability and robustness so you know

468
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49,980
 

469
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:52,350
 we're we're if we use Twitter data today

470
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,350
 

471
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:54,420
 to decide if someone's creditworthy that

472
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,420
 

473
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:56,370
 that may be difficult because maybe

474
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:56,370
 

475
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,750
 people who run Twitter three years ago

476
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,750
 

477
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:59,520
 or different from people who join

478
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,520
 

479
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,930
 Twitter during the presidential election

480
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,930
 

481
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:03,270
 and maybe it's a different signal of

482
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,270
 

483
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:05,880
 what kind of person you are

484
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,880
 

485
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:08,760
 year by year you know whether how your

486
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:08,760
 

487
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:11,460
 Twitter usage is changing so things like

488
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,460
 

489
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:14,670
 stability are also important for

490
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:14,670
 

491
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:18,210
 applications and that again is related

492
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:18,210
 

493
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:20,910
 to robustness as well a similar concept

494
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,910
 

495
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:22,650
 transfer learning so we might estimate a

496
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,650
 

497
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:25,620
 model in one setting and want it to

498
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,620
 

499
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:27,270
 apply in another setting there's a very

500
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:27,270
 

501
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:30,600
 exciting machine learning literature

502
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:30,600
 

503
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:33,030
 around fairness and discrimination and

504
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:33,030
 

505
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,920
 we again with black box models we have

506
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,920
 

507
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:37,170
 to figure out ways to assess them and

508
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:37,170
 

509
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:39,000
 see if they are discriminating or if

510
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,000
 

511
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:40,860
 they're unfair in certain ways or if

512
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:40,860
 

513
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,200
 they're making generalizations that were

514
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:43,200
 

515
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,790
 uncomfortable with and I think there's a

516
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,790
 

517
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,010
 bigger picture we're building a big

518
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,010
 

519
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:48,750
 initiative at Stanford on human centered

520
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,750
 

521
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:51,030
 artificial intelligence and and I'm

522
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,030
 

523
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:54,330
 involved in organizing that and leading

524
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:54,330
 

525
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:56,370
 it and one of our missions is to is to

526
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,370
 

527
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:59,730
 create more human-like artificial

528
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,730
 

529
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:02,760
 intelligence but to me you know what

530
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,760
 

531
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:03,960
 does it mean to be human like one big

532
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,960
 

533
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,660
 aspect is that you're gonna make

534
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:06,660
 

535
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:09,150
 reasonable inferences reasonable

536
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:09,150
 

537
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:11,339
 decisions in scenarios that you haven't

538
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,339
 

539
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:12,930
 seen before and again that's gonna be

540
00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:12,930
 

541
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:17,190
 part of causal inference and

542
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:17,190
 

543
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:18,600
 counterfactual reasoning so my argument

544
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,600
 

545
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:23,040
 is going to be that actually all of

546
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:23,040
 

547
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:27,390
 these desiderata are satisfied sort of

548
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:27,390
 

549
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:29,730
 by design in a causal model now I'm not

550
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,730
 

551
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:31,260
 going to argue that all problems

552
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,260
 

553
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:33,240
 can be solved or that I can solve all

554
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,240
 

555
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:36,180
 problems because actually it's really

556
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:36,180
 

557
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:38,279
 hard to actually implement a causal

558
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,279
 

559
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:40,709
 inference framework and to get credible

560
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:40,709
 

561
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:42,600
 estimates so but the causal inference

562
00:15:40,699 --> 00:15:42,600
 

563
00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:44,880
 framework actually gives a framework for

564
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:44,880
 

565
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,500
 understanding and in at least a

566
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,500
 

567
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,899
 guideline for how you would address all

568
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,899
 

569
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:51,420
 of these issues so in a causal inference

570
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:51,420
 

571
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:53,339
 framework really your goal the stated

572
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,339
 

573
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:55,980
 goal is to learn a model of how the

574
00:15:53,329 --> 00:15:55,980
 

575
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:58,440
 world works and that can be something

576
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,440
 

577
00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:00,300
 simple like what happens to your body if

578
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:00,300
 

579
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,670
 I give you a drug that's like a simple

580
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,670
 

581
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:04,380
 treatment a simple intervention it can

582
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,380
 

583
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:06,120
 be like a production function so I'm

584
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,120
 

585
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:09,839
 trying to understand the mapping from

586
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:09,839
 

587
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:12,089
 inputs to outputs of a firm it can be

588
00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:12,089
 

589
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,709
 something like understanding you know

590
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,709
 

591
00:16:12,089 --> 00:16:17,160
 what would happen if I raise the price

592
00:16:13,699 --> 00:16:17,160
 

593
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:19,110
 which consumers change their behavior

594
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,110
 

595
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:22,050
 and it might even be something as

596
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,050
 

597
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:24,029
 complicated as doing inference about

598
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,029
 

599
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:25,680
 what happens if I change the rules of an

600
00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:25,680
 

601
00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:27,269
 auction that's something we thought

602
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,269
 

603
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,320
 about at the search engine you know what

604
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:28,320
 

605
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:30,060
 would happen if we move from a

606
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,060
 

607
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,940
 generalized second price auction to a

608
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,940
 

609
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:35,250
 Vickrey auction and in my early career I

610
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:35,250
 

611
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:37,800
 worked on timber auctions and looked at

612
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,800
 

613
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:40,319
 comparing first price sealed bid options

614
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,319
 

615
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:42,480
 to open ascending auctions and second

616
00:16:40,309 --> 00:16:42,480
 

617
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:43,980
 price auctions so we might want to do

618
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,980
 

619
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,720
 inference about what happens when we

620
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,720
 

621
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,370
 change the rules of the game and indeed

622
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,370
 

623
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,050
 economists have you applied these

624
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,050
 

625
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:50,790
 techniques not just the timber auctions

626
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,790
 

627
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:53,639
 also to Treasury bill auctions and

628
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,639
 

629
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:57,060
 online advertising auctions so these are

630
00:16:53,629 --> 00:16:57,060
 

631
00:16:53,639 --> 00:17:01,230
 the kinds of questions we want now in

632
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:01,230
 

633
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:03,029
 general there's within the SSA within

634
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,029
 

635
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:04,890
 economics with empirical economics I

636
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:04,890
 

637
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:06,150
 would say like 95% of the empirical

638
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,150
 

639
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:08,760
 workers in the causal inference

640
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,760
 

641
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:11,309
 framework so almost all of the work that

642
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,309
 

643
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,260
 is done in that field this is trying to

644
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:13,260
 

645
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:15,870
 get causal effects and even though

646
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,870
 

647
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:18,329
 everybody agrees on that goal there's

648
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,329
 

649
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:20,130
 huge arguments about how to approach the

650
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,130
 

651
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:22,589
 goal and whether any particular paper

652
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,589
 

653
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:24,839
 achieves the goal and that's partly

654
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:24,839
 

655
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:26,429
 because you can't just look at the data

656
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:26,429
 

657
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:28,799
 and see whether you've got the right

658
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:28,799
 

659
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:30,600
 answer for causal inference it's almost

660
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:30,600
 

661
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,190
 always assumptions unless you have

662
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,190
 

663
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,320
 repeated experiments and of course

664
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,320
 

665
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:36,000
 that's something that we look for in

666
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:36,000
 

667
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,980
 ideally you would have a world with lots

668
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,980
 

669
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,419
 of experiments so you use data from some

670
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,419
 

671
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,559
 experiments and you can see how you do

672
00:17:39,409 --> 00:17:40,559
 

673
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:42,179
 on other experiments but you don't

674
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:42,179
 

675
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,610
 always have that scenario especially if

676
00:17:42,169 --> 00:17:44,610
 

677
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:46,679
 you've never done something before

678
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,679
 

679
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:48,000
 and so one of the things that we spend a

680
00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:48,000
 

681
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:50,070
 lot of time worrying about is that the

682
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:50,070
 

683
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,769
 impact of an intervention can be contact

684
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,769
 

685
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:54,960
 specific we worry about external

686
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:54,960
 

687
00:17:52,769 --> 00:17:56,519
 validity that I might learn something in

688
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,519
 

689
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,769
 this setting but it doesn't generalize

690
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:58,769
 

691
00:17:56,519 --> 00:18:00,210
 well to other settings now that's not a

692
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:00,210
 

693
00:17:58,769 --> 00:18:01,679
 problem with the framework because in

694
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,679
 

695
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:04,799
 principle you can write down all the

696
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:04,799
 

697
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,899
 things about the context that effect you

698
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:06,899
 

699
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,879
 know whether the drug works or whether

700
00:18:06,889 --> 00:18:08,879
 

701
00:18:06,899 --> 00:18:11,039
 giving children bed nets or lower in

702
00:18:08,869 --> 00:18:11,039
 

703
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:12,929
 class size is a good idea but in

704
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:12,929
 

705
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:15,240
 practice of course it's very hard to

706
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:15,240
 

707
00:18:12,929 --> 00:18:17,580
 estimate all of those things so again

708
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:17,580
 

709
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:20,070
 this comes to be a practical problem but

710
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:20,070
 

711
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:22,740
 at least we have a language and a

712
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,740
 

713
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:25,559
 formalism to talk about what goes wrong

714
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:25,559
 

715
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:27,539
 when we try to generalize so our model

716
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:27,539
 

717
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:30,179
 would map contexts and interventions to

718
00:18:27,529 --> 00:18:30,179
 

719
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:32,070
 outcomes and again we have a would then

720
00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:32,070
 

721
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:36,029
 have a formal language to separate

722
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:36,029
 

723
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:38,070
 correlates and from causes so think

724
00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:38,070
 

725
00:18:36,029 --> 00:18:40,559
 about you know something like gender you

726
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,559
 

727
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:41,730
 know if you say okay here I'm a 47 year

728
00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:41,730
 

729
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,379
 old woman with three kids

730
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,379
 

731
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:45,899
 how much do I know about artificial

732
00:18:43,369 --> 00:18:45,899
 

733
00:18:43,379 --> 00:18:48,000
 intelligence maybe if you all that's all

734
00:18:45,889 --> 00:18:48,000
 

735
00:18:45,899 --> 00:18:50,820
 you know about me your your guess is

736
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:50,820
 

737
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,950
 that you know probably not that much

738
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:52,950
 

739
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:54,419
 your average 47 year old woman with

740
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,419
 

741
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:55,799
 three kids in the United States probably

742
00:18:54,409 --> 00:18:55,799
 

743
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:57,419
 doesn't know that much about artificial

744
00:18:55,789 --> 00:18:57,419
 

745
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:59,669
 intelligence although I would say my

746
00:18:57,409 --> 00:18:59,669
 

747
00:18:57,419 --> 00:19:02,009
 border patrol person entering at the

748
00:18:59,659 --> 00:19:02,009
 

749
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:04,110
 airport asked me if I was a natural

750
00:19:01,999 --> 00:19:04,110
 

751
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:07,110
 language specialist and I said no i was

752
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,110
 

753
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:11,309
 doing causal and friends so and he

754
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,309
 

755
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:13,289
 complimented me for being original so

756
00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:13,289
 

757
00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:16,919
 you know maybe everybody knows something

758
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,919
 

759
00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:18,990
 now but you know if you so of course we

760
00:19:16,909 --> 00:19:18,990
 

761
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:21,720
 have lots of covariance that can be

762
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,720
 

763
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:24,149
 predictive of people's attributes in the

764
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:24,149
 

765
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,799
 absence of other information but you

766
00:19:24,139 --> 00:19:25,799
 

767
00:19:24,149 --> 00:19:28,080
 might want to think about what would

768
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:28,080
 

769
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:29,669
 actually you know cause me to know

770
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,669
 

771
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,350
 something about this subject and it

772
00:19:29,659 --> 00:19:31,350
 

773
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,610
 might be my computer science degree from

774
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,610
 

775
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:34,590
 undergrad it might be all my

776
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,590
 

777
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:37,110
 publications and research that i've done

778
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:37,110
 

779
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:42,029
 and those are the real causes of my of

780
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:42,029
 

781
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:44,100
 my expertise so the ideal causal model

782
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:44,100
 

783
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:47,990
 is by definition both stable and

784
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:47,990
 

785
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:51,539
 interpretable because it's a model and

786
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,539
 

787
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:53,250
 so when we write down a causal model we

788
00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:53,250
 

789
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:55,570
 are giving it an interpretation when I

790
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,570
 

791
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:58,240
 say here's a drug I want to S

792
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,240
 

793
00:19:55,570 --> 00:20:00,310
 the effect of the drug that's interprete

794
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,310
 

795
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,950
 below it's a well-defined mathematical

796
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,950
 

797
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:05,110
 object you can argue when I show you a

798
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,110
 

799
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:07,360
 number and I say hey this drug makes you

800
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,360
 

801
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:08,890
 ten percent better you can argue about

802
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,890
 

803
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,690
 whether I've actually measured that

804
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,690
 

805
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:11,980
 properly and whether I have an unbiased

806
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,980
 

807
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:14,620
 estimate and whether there were

808
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,620
 

809
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:16,120
 confounders and compliance issues and

810
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,120
 

811
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:18,370
 all sorts of other problems but

812
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,370
 

813
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:22,420
 conceptually the thing I'm estimating my

814
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,420
 

815
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:24,520
 s demand is perfectly interpretable it's

816
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,520
 

817
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:27,660
 just a problem of whether I've actually

818
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:27,660
 

819
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:30,010
 succeeded in doing that in practice

820
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:30,010
 

821
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:32,680
 transferability well in principle if I

822
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,680
 

823
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:35,350
 understand the the impact of a treatment

824
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:35,350
 

825
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:37,510
 and I understand how the context changes

826
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,510
 

827
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:39,970
 the interaction of the treatment that I

828
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,970
 

829
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:43,180
 can transfer it to any new environment

830
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,180
 

831
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:45,100
 and again with fairness you know many

832
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,100
 

833
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:47,320
 aspects of discrimination relate very

834
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:47,320
 

835
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:49,480
 closely to sort of correlation versus

836
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,480
 

837
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,610
 causation and the fact that we're doing

838
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:51,610
 

839
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:54,190
 sort of statistical discrimination are

840
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,190
 

841
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:56,590
 as Bayesian human beings we're all

842
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,590
 

843
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:58,390
 Bayesian right so as Bayesian human

844
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,390
 

845
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:00,580
 beings we update if we only have a few

846
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,580
 

847
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:03,250
 pieces of data we draw inferences based

848
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:03,250
 

849
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:05,260
 on that data and our models are our

850
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,260
 

851
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:07,270
 drawing inferences from data as well and

852
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,270
 

853
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:09,310
 if they say there's too many covariance

854
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,310
 

855
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:12,190
 and we do some regularization we're

856
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,190
 

857
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:14,950
 gonna load up onto some attributes even

858
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,950
 

859
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:19,150
 if those aren't aren't actually causal

860
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,150
 

861
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:21,790
 so I would argue that you know in some

862
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,790
 

863
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:22,960
 sense like a lot of the world problems

864
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,960
 

865
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:25,510
 could be solved if we could all just

866
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,510
 

867
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,010
 estimate causal models all the time but

868
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,010
 

869
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:29,500
 as I mentioned I'm not going to argue

870
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,500
 

871
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:31,390
 that I or any of my friends can solve

872
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:31,390
 

873
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:34,360
 all of your problems because it's

874
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,360
 

875
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:36,820
 actually really really hard to do causal

876
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,820
 

877
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,620
 inference and there's all sorts of

878
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:38,620
 

879
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:40,060
 challenges that remain probably the

880
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:40,060
 

881
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:41,980
 biggest one and the one that we've

882
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,980
 

883
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:43,570
 struggled with for decades in economics

884
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,570
 

885
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:45,910
 is that we just don't have the right

886
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,910
 

887
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:47,590
 kind of variation in the data you until

888
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,590
 

889
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:50,260
 recently firms didn't run many

890
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,260
 

891
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:51,670
 experiments and so you know if we wanted

892
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,670
 

893
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:53,530
 to understand what would happen if a

894
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,530
 

895
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:55,120
 firm changed its price you know an

896
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,120
 

897
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:56,590
 economic consultant might go to a firm

898
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,590
 

899
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,200
 and say all right show me your data

900
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,200
 

901
00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:00,730
 they're like well you know we've kept

902
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,730
 

903
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,290
 our price of the cereal

904
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,290
 

905
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:05,230
 you know constant for the last three

906
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,230
 

907
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:06,460
 years you're like okay so how am I going

908
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,460
 

909
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:08,230
 to figure out what would happen if you

910
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,230
 

911
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:09,320
 change the price that can be really

912
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,320
 

913
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:12,429
 difficult if they've met

914
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:12,429
 

915
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:14,840
 ever change the price in the past and

916
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:14,840
 

917
00:22:12,429 --> 00:22:18,320
 you know so there's there might be lack

918
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:18,320
 

919
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:20,720
 of variation at all or then it might be

920
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,720
 

921
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:23,929
 that the variation that they do have is

922
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:23,929
 

923
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:27,590
 it's due to confounders so suppose I

924
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,590
 

925
00:22:23,929 --> 00:22:29,960
 wanted to try to understand you know the

926
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,960
 

927
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:32,750
 impact of a hotel raising its price I

928
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:32,750
 

929
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:35,000
 could go out and you know count people

930
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:35,000
 

931
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:38,330
 going into hotels and I could scrape

932
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:38,330
 

933
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,549
 prices from hotels calm to see what the

934
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,549
 

935
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:42,769
 prices were and I might I would see

936
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:42,769
 

937
00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:45,320
 prices change and I would see the number

938
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:45,320
 

939
00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:48,230
 of people in the hotel change but what I

940
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:48,230
 

941
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:52,460
 would also see is that when the prices

942
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:52,460
 

943
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:55,190
 are high is the hotel full or empty full

944
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:55,190
 

945
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:58,159
 right what our price is like right here

946
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:58,159
 

947
00:22:55,190 --> 00:23:00,080
 right now they're high because you guys

948
00:22:58,149 --> 00:23:00,080
 

949
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:03,110
 filled up all the rooms okay and that's

950
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:03,110
 

951
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,519
 because the hotels are using algorithms

952
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,519
 

953
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:05,690
 to set their prices and in particular

954
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:05,690
 

955
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:07,190
 when it looks like there's a big

956
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,190
 

957
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:08,750
 conference coming to town of course

958
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,750
 

959
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:10,070
 there's discounts and so on for some

960
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,070
 

961
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,779
 people but for a regular business

962
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,779
 

963
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:14,620
 traveler who wanted to stay here this

964
00:23:11,769 --> 00:23:14,620
 

965
00:23:11,779 --> 00:23:17,000
 week they're paying a very high price so

966
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:17,000
 

967
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:18,710
 there's there's variation in the data

968
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,710
 

969
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,509
 there's lots of price changes in the

970
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,509
 

971
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:22,519
 data but it's not the right kind of

972
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:22,519
 

973
00:23:20,509 --> 00:23:24,769
 variation it's not experimental

974
00:23:22,509 --> 00:23:24,769
 

975
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:26,899
 variation and in particular it's moving

976
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:26,899
 

977
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:28,580
 sort of one-for-one with demand and so

978
00:23:26,889 --> 00:23:28,580
 

979
00:23:26,899 --> 00:23:30,559
 it's hard to know what would happen if I

980
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,559
 

981
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:34,519
 change my algorithm to set a higher

982
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:34,519
 

983
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:35,990
 price in every state of the world we

984
00:23:34,509 --> 00:23:35,990
 

985
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:37,730
 also typically have a hard time

986
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,730
 

987
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:39,649
 observing all the context or getting

988
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,649
 

989
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:41,269
 enough data about all the context in

990
00:23:39,639 --> 00:23:41,269
 

991
00:23:39,649 --> 00:23:44,269
 order to understand treatment effect

992
00:23:41,259 --> 00:23:44,269
 

993
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:46,009
 heterogeneity and then also analysts

994
00:23:44,259 --> 00:23:46,009
 

995
00:23:44,269 --> 00:23:49,820
 often have a lack of knowledge about the

996
00:23:45,999 --> 00:23:49,820
 

997
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:51,470
 model and again what you know we this

998
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:51,470
 

999
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:53,690
 problem we struggle with any economics

1000
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,690
 

1001
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:56,090
 for the last few decades is that we

1002
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,090
 

1003
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:58,250
 often were in a data poor environment so

1004
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,250
 

1005
00:23:56,090 --> 00:24:01,700
 we've had people working on problems

1006
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,700
 

1007
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:04,100
 like dynamic games between firms or

1008
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,100
 

1009
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:06,590
 dynamic decisions that workers make

1010
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:06,590
 

1011
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:08,690
 about unemployment decisions and so on

1012
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,690
 

1013
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:10,669
 but unemployment insurance or whether to

1014
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,669
 

1015
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:14,419
 take a job we've been building these

1016
00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:14,419
 

1017
00:24:10,669 --> 00:24:16,070
 models for decades and but and they've

1018
00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:16,070
 

1019
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:17,600
 worked pretty well this is inverse

1020
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,600
 

1021
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:19,760
 reinforcement learning it turns out like

1022
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,760
 

1023
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,980
 several of the components of alphago are

1024
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,980
 

1025
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,880
 basically map right on to techniques

1026
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:22,880
 

1027
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:27,080
 that were used in the nineteen

1028
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:27,080
 

1029
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:29,480
 90's in economics but what they think

1030
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:29,480
 

1031
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:31,820
 those methods didn't sort of change the

1032
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,820
 

1033
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:35,000
 world firms didn't replace their store

1034
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:35,000
 

1035
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:36,800
 opening managers with a eyes because it

1036
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,800
 

1037
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,060
 was actually pretty hard our problem

1038
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:38,060
 

1039
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,680
 wasn't that we didn't know the right

1040
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:39,680
 

1041
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,780
 techniques the problem was we didn't

1042
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,780
 

1043
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,610
 have enough data and we didn't have

1044
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,610
 

1045
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:45,830
 enough variation in the data to really

1046
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,830
 

1047
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:47,960
 understand you know what would happen if

1048
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,960
 

1049
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:49,760
 Walmart opens a store here and doesn't

1050
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,760
 

1051
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:52,370
 open a store there if Target opens a

1052
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:52,370
 

1053
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:55,070
 store here and so on so the problems are

1054
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,070
 

1055
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:56,960
 really not conceptual problems the

1056
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,960
 

1057
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:58,550
 conceptual framework is solid the

1058
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:58,550
 

1059
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,040
 problem is how do we implement in

1060
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:01,040
 

1061
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:02,930
 practice now the very exciting thing is

1062
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,930
 

1063
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:05,090
 that now we have firms that are running

1064
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,090
 

1065
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:06,710
 tons of experiments and we have we're

1066
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,710
 

1067
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:09,050
 interacting with humans in a digital

1068
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,050
 

1069
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:10,640
 environment so actually we're creating

1070
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,640
 

1071
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:13,640
 environments with lots and lots of

1072
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:13,640
 

1073
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,470
 variation lots and lots of data lots and

1074
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:15,470
 

1075
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,690
 lots of context so the reason this got

1076
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,690
 

1077
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:19,280
 really exciting for me is not because

1078
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,280
 

1079
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:21,290
 there was some groundbreaking new

1080
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:21,290
 

1081
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:23,660
 philosophy some since we've had the

1082
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,660
 

1083
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:25,730
 philosophy for a very long time the what

1084
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:25,730
 

1085
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:28,250
 was exciting is wow we can actually do

1086
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,250
 

1087
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:30,020
 something with it outside of a few very

1088
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,020
 

1089
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:32,480
 special circumstances we can do

1090
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:32,480
 

1091
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:34,940
 something credible at the same time I'm

1092
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,940
 

1093
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,470
 much more optimistic too about the

1094
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:36,470
 

1095
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:38,150
 ability of all these techniques to work

1096
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,150
 

1097
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:39,680
 in settings that have lots of

1098
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,680
 

1099
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:42,080
 experiments and lots of randomization

1100
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:42,080
 

1101
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:44,840
 like the tech firm settings then I am

1102
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:44,840
 

1103
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:47,270
 for you know settings that don't have

1104
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:47,270
 

1105
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:50,300
 that so we'll you know building a AI to

1106
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:50,300
 

1107
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:51,920
 run the central bank or to make opening

1108
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:51,920
 

1109
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:55,220
 and closing decisions for Walmart I

1110
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:55,220
 

1111
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:58,880
 think is much much further off than some

1112
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:58,880
 

1113
00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:00,290
 of the other problems so now I'm kind of

1114
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:00,290
 

1115
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,870
 drilling in a little bit more deeply

1116
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,870
 

1117
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:04,700
 into more like true AI algorithms so I'm

1118
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,700
 

1119
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:06,500
 going to use as an example in this talk

1120
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,500
 

1121
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:09,140
 sort of contextual bandits because

1122
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:09,140
 

1123
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:11,750
 that's a very similar simple attractable

1124
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:11,750
 

1125
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:13,610
 example of a very simple artificial

1126
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,610
 

1127
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:15,680
 intelligence algorithm so you know

1128
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,680
 

1129
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:18,740
 multi-armed bandit is balancing

1130
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:18,740
 

1131
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:20,750
 exploration and exploitation to try to

1132
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:20,750
 

1133
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:23,930
 figure out which arm is the best to pull

1134
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:23,930
 

1135
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:26,840
 which is the best treatment arm and a

1136
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,840
 

1137
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:28,490
 contextual bandit understands that in

1138
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,490
 

1139
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:30,950
 different states of the world there

1140
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,950
 

1141
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:33,530
 might be different optimal treatments so

1142
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,530
 

1143
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:34,200
 if I want one application I'm looking at

1144
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,200
 

1145
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:35,790
 is reckon

1146
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:35,790
 

1147
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,710
 and charities keep recommending people

1148
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,710
 

1149
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:40,950
 give to charity when they come into

1150
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,950
 

1151
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:42,690
 checkout with PayPal so in that case the

1152
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,690
 

1153
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:44,520
 contextual information might be which

1154
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,520
 

1155
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:45,990
 websites they were coming from and maybe

1156
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,990
 

1157
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,970
 something about their purchase history

1158
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,970
 

1159
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:49,590
 and that might help me recommend a

1160
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,590
 

1161
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:51,990
 charity as well as a motivational

1162
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,990
 

1163
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:54,330
 message to the person and I'm gonna want

1164
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,330
 

1165
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:57,660
 to learn online learn over time what the

1166
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,660
 

1167
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:59,190
 best arm to pull is so that's a simple

1168
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,190
 

1169
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:00,990
 example of course reinforcement learning

1170
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,990
 

1171
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:03,150
 and the robots climbing the wall and the

1172
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,150
 

1173
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:05,730
 people you know playing video games and

1174
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,730
 

1175
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:07,590
 so on are more complex examples and but

1176
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,590
 

1177
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:09,660
 in all of these cases what the AI is

1178
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,660
 

1179
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:12,150
 doing is they're selecting among

1180
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:12,150
 

1181
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:14,940
 alternative choices and they therefore

1182
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,940
 

1183
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:17,250
 must have an explicit or implicit model

1184
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:17,250
 

1185
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:19,590
 of the payoff from alternatives and

1186
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,590
 

1187
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:21,510
 that's a counterfactual model and that's

1188
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,510
 

1189
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:23,520
 not surprising that say the especially

1190
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,520
 

1191
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:25,500
 the people working in the contextual

1192
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,500
 

1193
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,330
 bandit literature have been sort of

1194
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:27,330
 

1195
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:29,070
 closer to the statistical literature on

1196
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,070
 

1197
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:30,780
 causal inference than some other parts

1198
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,780
 

1199
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:33,690
 of machine learning because you

1200
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:33,690
 

1201
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:35,580
 recognize that actually if I'm running

1202
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,580
 

1203
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:39,240
 experiments I need to I'm thinking about

1204
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:39,240
 

1205
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:40,680
 counterfactual reasoning of course in

1206
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,680
 

1207
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,840
 the initial phases of learning you have

1208
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:42,840
 

1209
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:44,580
 limited data so a lot of the theory in

1210
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,580
 

1211
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,710
 this literature is just like ok n goes

1212
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:46,710
 

1213
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:50,250
 to infinity everything is good we've

1214
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,250
 

1215
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:52,290
 learned the best thing eventually but if

1216
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,290
 

1217
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:53,670
 I'm running survey experiments or if I'm

1218
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,670
 

1219
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:55,650
 trying to get people to vote or whatever

1220
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,650
 

1221
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:57,810
 I actually often don't have enough data

1222
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,810
 

1223
00:27:55,650 --> 00:28:01,170
 treatment effects are often pretty weak

1224
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,170
 

1225
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:03,270
 I'm often very underpowered so actually

1226
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,270
 

1227
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:06,360
 you really do care about what happens

1228
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:06,360
 

1229
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:08,610
 and this in the initial stages and it's

1230
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,610
 

1231
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:11,520
 important to be a good statistician so I

1232
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,520
 

1233
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:14,490
 would argue inside sort of every AI of

1234
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:14,490
 

1235
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:17,880
 this type is a statistician performing

1236
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,880
 

1237
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:19,560
 counterfactual reasoning you haven't

1238
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,560
 

1239
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,240
 necessarily written it down or spelled

1240
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,240
 

1241
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,500
 it out but that must be what you're

1242
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,500
 

1243
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,850
 doing of course unless you just

1244
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:23,850
 

1245
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,740
 programmed all these heuristics in to

1246
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,740
 

1247
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:27,780
 start with but an AI that's exploring

1248
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:27,780
 

1249
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:29,640
 and learning about the world is going to

1250
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:29,640
 

1251
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:32,310
 be building a model from its past data

1252
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:32,310
 

1253
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:35,070
 and drawing inferences about the best

1254
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:35,070
 

1255
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:37,530
 action to take in the future and I think

1256
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,530
 

1257
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:39,690
 it's then it's sort of tautological that

1258
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,690
 

1259
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:42,570
 you would rather your AI be a good

1260
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,570
 

1261
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:44,640
 statistician than be a bad statistician

1262
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,640
 

1263
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:46,560
 ok and so of course at the beginning

1264
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:46,560
 

1265
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,559
 we're gonna be really excited about all

1266
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,559
 

1267
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,389
 of our eyes

1268
00:28:47,549 --> 00:28:49,389
 

1269
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,860
 there are simple statisticians I won't

1270
00:28:49,379 --> 00:28:50,860
 

1271
00:28:49,389 --> 00:28:52,720
 call them bad statisticians but there

1272
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:52,720
 

1273
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:54,039
 are simplistic statisticians because

1274
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:54,039
 

1275
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,230
 they can do really cool things they

1276
00:28:54,029 --> 00:28:56,230
 

1277
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:58,389
 climb over walls they play video games

1278
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,389
 

1279
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:59,980
 they run mazes and so on but eventually

1280
00:28:58,379 --> 00:28:59,980
 

1281
00:28:58,389 --> 00:29:02,379
 you know we're gonna hit some

1282
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:02,379
 

1283
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:04,059
 diminishing returns to that and then for

1284
00:29:02,369 --> 00:29:04,059
 

1285
00:29:02,379 --> 00:29:06,220
 the next round of improvements you know

1286
00:29:04,049 --> 00:29:06,220
 

1287
00:29:04,059 --> 00:29:08,110
 being a good statistician is going to be

1288
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:08,110
 

1289
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:09,850
 very important and indeed you know I've

1290
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,850
 

1291
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:11,139
 seen in practice and applications of

1292
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,139
 

1293
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:13,779
 banded algorithms that they can kind of

1294
00:29:11,129 --> 00:29:13,779
 

1295
00:29:11,139 --> 00:29:15,730
 go off the rails due to bias ease that

1296
00:29:13,769 --> 00:29:15,730
 

1297
00:29:13,779 --> 00:29:17,559
 are very predictable if you think from

1298
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,559
 

1299
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:19,539
 the perspective of causal inference and

1300
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:19,539
 

1301
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:21,159
 that's basically just you know you're

1302
00:29:19,529 --> 00:29:21,159
 

1303
00:29:19,539 --> 00:29:23,139
 gonna tend to in a region where you

1304
00:29:21,149 --> 00:29:23,139
 

1305
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:25,269
 think that RMA is good you're gonna pull

1306
00:29:23,129 --> 00:29:25,269
 

1307
00:29:23,139 --> 00:29:27,100
 arm a a lot in a region where you think

1308
00:29:25,259 --> 00:29:27,100
 

1309
00:29:25,269 --> 00:29:29,619
 arm B is good you're gonna pull R&B a

1310
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:29,619
 

1311
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:31,179
 lot and then as a statistician you're

1312
00:29:29,609 --> 00:29:31,179
 

1313
00:29:29,619 --> 00:29:33,700
 gonna end up having sort of biased data

1314
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:33,700
 

1315
00:29:31,179 --> 00:29:35,200
 because RMA is gonna be you're gonna be

1316
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,200
 

1317
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:37,480
 getting high outcomes for RMA in that

1318
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,480
 

1319
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,889
 region where arm a is good and high

1320
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,889
 

1321
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,450
 outcomes for um B in the region where

1322
00:29:38,879 --> 00:29:40,450
 

1323
00:29:38,889 --> 00:29:42,460
 arm B is good and you're not going to

1324
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,460
 

1325
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:45,279
 necessarily extrapolate well to the rest

1326
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:45,279
 

1327
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:46,749
 of the distribution and we have luckily

1328
00:29:45,269 --> 00:29:46,749
 

1329
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:48,639
 great techniques for dealing with that

1330
00:29:46,739 --> 00:29:48,639
 

1331
00:29:46,749 --> 00:29:50,139
 but they haven't been adopted so much so

1332
00:29:48,629 --> 00:29:50,139
 

1333
00:29:48,639 --> 00:29:55,059
 that's something that I've been working

1334
00:29:50,129 --> 00:29:55,059
 

1335
00:29:50,139 --> 00:29:56,799
 on with co-authors alright so in the

1336
00:29:55,049 --> 00:29:56,799
 

1337
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:58,960
 next little section of my talk I'm so

1338
00:29:56,789 --> 00:29:58,960
 

1339
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:01,330
 gonna be very conceptual and I'm gonna

1340
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:01,330
 

1341
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,519
 talk through a couple of different types

1342
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,519
 

1343
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:04,899
 of counterfactual inference and I should

1344
00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:04,899
 

1345
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:08,340
 say that this is one thing that gets

1346
00:30:04,889 --> 00:30:08,340
 

1347
00:30:04,899 --> 00:30:10,539
 very confusing especially in

1348
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:10,539
 

1349
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:12,909
 interdisciplinary audiences because you

1350
00:30:10,529 --> 00:30:12,909
 

1351
00:30:10,539 --> 00:30:15,220
 say the words and everybody thinks it

1352
00:30:12,899 --> 00:30:15,220
 

1353
00:30:12,909 --> 00:30:17,259
 means something specific but perhaps

1354
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:17,259
 

1355
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:19,029
 something different and I would say we

1356
00:30:17,249 --> 00:30:19,029
 

1357
00:30:17,259 --> 00:30:21,669
 have good history on that in economics

1358
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:21,669
 

1359
00:30:19,029 --> 00:30:26,190
 because we've been having arguments huge

1360
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:26,190
 

1361
00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:27,820
 clashes Wars debates fights between

1362
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,820
 

1363
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:30,580
 different leaders of different

1364
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:30,580
 

1365
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:32,860
 approaches to causal inference over over

1366
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:32,860
 

1367
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:34,059
 the last decades so just because you

1368
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:34,059
 

1369
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:35,799
 agree that you want to think about

1370
00:30:34,049 --> 00:30:35,799
 

1371
00:30:34,059 --> 00:30:37,450
 causal reasoning doesn't mean that you

1372
00:30:35,789 --> 00:30:37,450
 

1373
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:38,980
 agree about how you should write it down

1374
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,980
 

1375
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:41,350
 you know whether you should use

1376
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,350
 

1377
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:43,570
 equations or this notation or that

1378
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,570
 

1379
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:44,740
 notation and also doesn't mean that

1380
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,740
 

1381
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:46,899
 everybody agrees on what the most

1382
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:46,899
 

1383
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:50,080
 interesting questions are I think a lot

1384
00:30:46,889 --> 00:30:50,080
 

1385
00:30:46,899 --> 00:30:52,119
 of that noise can be dealt with by just

1386
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:52,119
 

1387
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,009
 realizing actually there are lots of

1388
00:30:52,109 --> 00:30:54,009
 

1389
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:56,110
 different questions some they're usually

1390
00:30:53,999 --> 00:30:56,110
 

1391
00:30:54,009 --> 00:30:59,019
 multiple ways to write down the same

1392
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:59,019
 

1393
00:30:56,110 --> 00:31:00,309
 thing and we just need to be a little

1394
00:30:59,009 --> 00:31:00,309
 

1395
00:30:59,019 --> 00:31:01,120
 more precise about where we're talking

1396
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:01,120
 

1397
00:31:00,309 --> 00:31:02,410
 about

1398
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,410
 

1399
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,080
 and there's really no reason to fight

1400
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,080
 

1401
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:08,890
 about mathematics we just have to write

1402
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:08,890
 

1403
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:11,170
 down correct mathematics so the first

1404
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,170
 

1405
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:13,510
 type of counterfactual inference

1406
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,510
 

1407
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:16,320
 especially it's very popular in the

1408
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,320
 

1409
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:18,610
 social sciences and biostatistics is

1410
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:18,610
 

1411
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,580
 what we call an economics program

1412
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,580
 

1413
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:24,640
 evaluation or more broadly treatment

1414
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:24,640
 

1415
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:25,900
 effect estimation and so the examples of

1416
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:25,900
 

1417
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,240
 the kinds of questions we've been

1418
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:28,240
 

1419
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:30,370
 worrying about for a long time or things

1420
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:30,370
 

1421
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,320
 like what was the impact of raising the

1422
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,320
 

1423
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:34,330
 minimum wage you know this is a very

1424
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:34,330
 

1425
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:37,240
 famous paper from several decades ago

1426
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,240
 

1427
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:38,590
 trying to look at the impact of changing

1428
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,590
 

1429
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,270
 the minimum wage and you're comparing

1430
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,270
 

1431
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:43,240
 New York I mean New Jersey to

1432
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:43,240
 

1433
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:45,190
 Pennsylvania and you know you try to use

1434
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:45,190
 

1435
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,720
 one as a control for the time trend and

1436
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,720
 

1437
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:48,730
 the other to understand the impact of

1438
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,730
 

1439
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,070
 the minimum wage so these types of

1440
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,070
 

1441
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:52,929
 problems have been hitting us for a very

1442
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,929
 

1443
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:55,600
 long time even in a world where we

1444
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:55,600
 

1445
00:31:52,929 --> 00:31:57,429
 didn't have a lot of data training

1446
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,429
 

1447
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,670
 programs have also been a really

1448
00:31:57,419 --> 00:32:00,670
 

1449
00:31:57,429 --> 00:32:02,500
 important and an active area big

1450
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,500
 

1451
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:06,010
 literature is on what's the effect of

1452
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:06,010
 

1453
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:07,690
 reducing class size for kids in the more

1454
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,690
 

1455
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:09,610
 modern economy one of the biggest

1456
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,610
 

1457
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:12,429
 applications of this literature is is

1458
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,429
 

1459
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:14,020
 advertising effectiveness and you know

1460
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:14,020
 

1461
00:32:12,429 --> 00:32:16,660
 there's an economist friend of mine it

1462
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:16,660
 

1463
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:18,850
 Netflix who's doing a ton of this and

1464
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:18,850
 

1465
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:20,440
 basically like Netflix is amazingly good

1466
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,440
 

1467
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:22,840
 at estimating the return on investment

1468
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,840
 

1469
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,850
 of their advertising using a lot of

1470
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,850
 

1471
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,860
 randomized experiments and also bringing

1472
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,860
 

1473
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:29,650
 together observational data with

1474
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:29,650
 

1475
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:31,059
 experimental data and so we have

1476
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,059
 

1477
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:33,010
 questions like did the advertising

1478
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:33,010
 

1479
00:32:31,059 --> 00:32:35,350
 campaign work and what was the ROI and

1480
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,350
 

1481
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:37,900
 these are very hard questions actually

1482
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,900
 

1483
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:41,740
 because as some of my colleagues pointed

1484
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:41,740
 

1485
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:44,650
 out in a research paper that basically

1486
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:44,650
 

1487
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:47,140
 most advertising experiments run by

1488
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,140
 

1489
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:49,000
 large firms or underpowered that means

1490
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:49,000
 

1491
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:51,460
 you don't have enough data to even tell

1492
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:51,460
 

1493
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,650
 if the campaign worked even if you had a

1494
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:53,650
 

1495
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:56,470
 perfectly designed experiment and you

1496
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,470
 

1497
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:57,760
 certainly can't reject you can't if

1498
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,760
 

1499
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:59,500
 you're lucky you can just tell whether

1500
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,500
 

1501
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,120
 the advertising worked but it's often

1502
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:01,120
 

1503
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,590
 almost impossible to tell if there was a

1504
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,590
 

1505
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,230
 positive return on investment whether it

1506
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,230
 

1507
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:06,610
 was worth the money so we we really need

1508
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,610
 

1509
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:07,809
 to be careful with our statistics about

1510
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,809
 

1511
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:09,700
 those problems because the

1512
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:09,700
 

1513
00:33:07,809 --> 00:33:12,040
 signal-to-noise ratio is such a problem

1514
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:12,040
 

1515
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:13,750
 another really active area the political

1516
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,750
 

1517
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,440
 science community is get out the vote

1518
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,440
 

1519
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:16,660
 campaign

1520
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:16,660
 

1521
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:18,100
 and actually for again since the 80s

1522
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,100
 

1523
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:20,050
 we've been running these large-scale

1524
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:20,050
 

1525
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:22,870
 experiments that used to do big mailings

1526
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,870
 

1527
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:25,210
 there was a famous study where they gave

1528
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:25,210
 

1529
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:26,800
 they sent people letters and they and

1530
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,800
 

1531
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:28,390
 you know your voting record in the u.s.

1532
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,390
 

1533
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,070
 is public so they sent people letters

1534
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,070
 

1535
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:32,410
 saying we're gonna tell your neighbors

1536
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,410
 

1537
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:34,780
 whether or not you voted and they

1538
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,780
 

1539
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:37,120
 compared the effectiveness of that to

1540
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:37,120
 

1541
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:38,830
 other types of messages and found that

1542
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,830
 

1543
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,970
 telling people they were going to tell

1544
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:39,970
 

1545
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:41,680
 their neighbors whether or not they

1546
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,680
 

1547
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:45,310
 voted was a very effective way to get

1548
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:45,310
 

1549
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:46,570
 people to vote and so we would we would

1550
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,570
 

1551
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:48,700
 want to estimate first of all do these

1552
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,700
 

1553
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:50,320
 campaigns work and now the more modern

1554
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:50,320
 

1555
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,880
 versions of these and these really are

1556
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,880
 

1557
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,980
 just getting rolled out in the last

1558
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,980
 

1559
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:56,020
 couple of campaigns are more you know

1560
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:56,020
 

1561
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:57,670
 personalised policies and these

1562
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:57,670
 

1563
00:33:56,020 --> 00:34:00,330
 campaigns are starting to use things

1564
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,330
 

1565
00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:02,860
 like bandits to learn the best policies

1566
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,860
 

1567
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:05,080
 and what's an optimal policy assigning

1568
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:05,080
 

1569
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:07,210
 workers to training programs so in this

1570
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:07,210
 

1571
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:09,610
 in this world the goal is to estimate

1572
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,610
 

1573
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:11,620
 the impact of an intervention and this

1574
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,620
 

1575
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:13,090
 literature generally focuses on low

1576
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:13,090
 

1577
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:15,610
 dimensional interventions

1578
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,610
 

1579
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:17,770
 there's extensions to more complex cases

1580
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,770
 

1581
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:20,470
 but like 95% of the literature is like

1582
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,470
 

1583
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:23,379
 about a binary treatment so like a drug

1584
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:23,379
 

1585
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:26,649
 or raising the minimum wage but like one

1586
00:34:23,369 --> 00:34:26,649
 

1587
00:34:23,379 --> 00:34:28,000
 change in the minimum wage the s demands

1588
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,000
 

1589
00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:29,230
 the things that people are interested in

1590
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:29,230
 

1591
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,770
 learning or like what was the average

1592
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:32,770
 

1593
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:35,350
 effect like just did this thing work the

1594
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,350
 

1595
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:37,929
 more sophisticated more recent versions

1596
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,929
 

1597
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:39,460
 look for heterogeneous effects so for

1598
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:39,460
 

1599
00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:41,169
 whom did it work because that will tell

1600
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:41,169
 

1601
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:43,090
 me in the future you know who should I

1602
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:43,090
 

1603
00:34:41,169 --> 00:34:45,879
 send a mailing to to try to get them to

1604
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,879
 

1605
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:47,679
 vote and and also more recently a lot

1606
00:34:45,869 --> 00:34:47,679
 

1607
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:49,720
 more emphasis on estimating optimal

1608
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:49,720
 

1609
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:53,500
 policies policies mapping from people's

1610
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:53,500
 

1611
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:55,600
 characteristics to their assignments and

1612
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:55,600
 

1613
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:58,960
 a big emphasis in this whole literature

1614
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:58,960
 

1615
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:01,240
 is confidence intervals so because we

1616
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:01,240
 

1617
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:04,060
 can't observe the ground truth and

1618
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:04,060
 

1619
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:06,420
 because there's often pretty noisy

1620
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:06,420
 

1621
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:09,250
 effects of most treatments and

1622
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:09,250
 

1623
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:11,050
 experiments and and so on are expensive

1624
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,050
 

1625
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:12,970
 we are typically really worried about

1626
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,970
 

1627
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:15,190
 sampling variation we're typically

1628
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,190
 

1629
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:17,590
 really worried about whether the effects

1630
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,590
 

1631
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:20,680
 we're finding or spurious and we're also

1632
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:20,680
 

1633
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:22,480
 really worried about bias we're worried

1634
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,480
 

1635
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,520
 about things that that we're actually

1636
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:24,520
 

1637
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,560
 going to say something's good when it's

1638
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,560
 

1639
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,520
 actually bad and so there's a huge

1640
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,520
 

1641
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,620
 emphasis on

1642
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:29,620
 

1643
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,180
 estimating an effect estimating it

1644
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:31,180
 

1645
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:35,140
 consistently and putting confidence

1646
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:35,140
 

1647
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:36,880
 intervals around it and you know just to

1648
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:36,880
 

1649
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:39,010
 get published in an economics journal

1650
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:39,010
 

1651
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,570
 that's basically table stakes it's one

1652
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,570
 

1653
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:42,070
 reason people have been slow to adopt a

1654
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,070
 

1655
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:43,720
 lot of machine learning methods because

1656
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,720
 

1657
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:45,820
 basically people don't know what to do

1658
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,820
 

1659
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:47,980
 if they're gonna write a paper where

1660
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,980
 

1661
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:49,630
 there's not a coefficient estimate and

1662
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:49,630
 

1663
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:51,790
 asymptotic normality theorem and

1664
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,790
 

1665
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:53,770
 confidence intervals so that's been part

1666
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,770
 

1667
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:55,780
 of my research agenda is to provide

1668
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,780
 

1669
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:57,370
 those four economists on machine

1670
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:57,370
 

1671
00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:00,070
 learning methods so that they can

1672
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,070
 

1673
00:35:57,370 --> 00:36:02,770
 actually start to use them now there's a

1674
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,770
 

1675
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:05,860
 big important point which I want to just

1676
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,860
 

1677
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:08,530
 pause on for a moment which is that we

1678
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:08,530
 

1679
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:10,690
 don't actually know the ground truth and

1680
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,690
 

1681
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:13,000
 I that's really a big difference between

1682
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,000
 

1683
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:15,340
 supervised learning and causal inference

1684
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:15,340
 

1685
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,080
 so I could think about what's the

1686
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:17,080
 

1687
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,750
 treatment effect for each of you of

1688
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,750
 

1689
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:21,820
 giving you coffee before you walked in

1690
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:21,820
 

1691
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:23,890
 well I could try to estimate that effect

1692
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:23,890
 

1693
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:25,960
 but of course you know people for whom

1694
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,960
 

1695
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:28,480
 coffee is effective or tend to have

1696
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:28,480
 

1697
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:30,340
 chosen coffee and people who don't like

1698
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:30,340
 

1699
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,290
 don't normally drink coffee and stay

1700
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:32,290
 

1701
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:34,360
 alert without coffee didn't get coffee

1702
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,360
 

1703
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:36,850
 so if I just met looked at the

1704
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:36,850
 

1705
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:39,100
 correlation in the audience I wouldn't

1706
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,100
 

1707
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:41,710
 be able to get that causal effect and if

1708
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:41,710
 

1709
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:43,780
 I held out 10% of you that wouldn't

1710
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,780
 

1711
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:45,090
 really change anything I could find a

1712
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:45,090
 

1713
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:47,320
 big positive correlation between

1714
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,320
 

1715
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:48,910
 actually in this case I might get a zero

1716
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:48,910
 

1717
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,290
 correlation between coffee and heart

1718
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,290
 

1719
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:52,330
 rate I might get that in the training

1720
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,330
 

1721
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:54,250
 set I would also get it in the test set

1722
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,250
 

1723
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:55,960
 but that wouldn't tell me anything about

1724
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,960
 

1725
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:57,400
 whether I got the right answer about

1726
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:57,400
 

1727
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:00,670
 what would happen if I force-fed you

1728
00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:00,670
 

1729
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:02,050
 coffee okay so the so we don't have

1730
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,050
 

1731
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:04,000
 treatment effects stamped on our

1732
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,000
 

1733
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:05,590
 forehead we don't have a held out test

1734
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:05,590
 

1735
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,240
 set that tells us whether we got the

1736
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,240
 

1737
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:10,630
 answer right or wrong and that's one

1738
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:10,630
 

1739
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:13,210
 reason that we focus a lot on theory so

1740
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:13,210
 

1741
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:15,640
 instead we this literature focuses a lot

1742
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,640
 

1743
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:17,590
 on designs that enable what we call

1744
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,590
 

1745
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:20,680
 identification and estimation of these

1746
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:20,680
 

1747
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:22,960
 effects so first of all this whole

1748
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,960
 

1749
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:24,850
 literature tends to focus on treatments

1750
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:24,850
 

1751
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,440
 that have been observed in the past so

1752
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,440
 

1753
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:28,660
 we have a data set some people got the

1754
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:28,660
 

1755
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,920
 drug some people didn't the problem is

1756
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:29,920
 

1757
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:32,800
 that maybe they weren't randomly

1758
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:32,800
 

1759
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,180
 assigned random as some random

1760
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,180
 

1761
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,120
 assignment is of course the gold

1762
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:36,120
 

1763
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:38,500
 standard for figuring out causal effects

1764
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:38,500
 

1765
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:40,020
 but what happens if you don't if you

1766
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:40,020
 

1767
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:42,600
 need to make a decision and you don't

1768
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:42,600
 

1769
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:45,150
 have that so this literature focuses on

1770
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:45,150
 

1771
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:47,130
 what we call designs different designs

1772
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,130
 

1773
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:49,050
 that would allow you to learn about

1774
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,050
 

1775
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:51,780
 causal effects even without a randomized

1776
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,780
 

1777
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:52,950
 experiment so one category are natural

1778
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:52,950
 

1779
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:54,420
 experiments and those are called

1780
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,420
 

1781
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:56,580
 instrumental variables there's one

1782
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:56,580
 

1783
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:58,590
 example and I'll come back to that also

1784
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:58,590
 

1785
00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:00,210
 unconfoundedness would fall into this

1786
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,210
 

1787
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:02,370
 under some assumptions and I'm going to

1788
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,370
 

1789
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:04,140
 go into those in some detail three

1790
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,140
 

1791
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:06,960
 others that I won't go into today but

1792
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:06,960
 

1793
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:08,580
 that are also very very popular for

1794
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:08,580
 

1795
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,470
 drawing causal inference in the social

1796
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:10,470
 

1797
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:13,470
 sciences one is regression discontinuity

1798
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:13,470
 

1799
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:15,480
 so you compare people near a boundary so

1800
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,480
 

1801
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:17,610
 for example I want to figure out the

1802
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:17,610
 

1803
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:20,070
 impact of being in school a versus

1804
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,070
 

1805
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:21,660
 school B I compare people on opposite

1806
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,660
 

1807
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:23,940
 sides of the street where there's a

1808
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:23,940
 

1809
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:25,500
 where the school district boundary is

1810
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:25,500
 

1811
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:27,270
 and I say well other you know their

1812
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:27,270
 

1813
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:29,220
 neighbors were similar their houses were

1814
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,220
 

1815
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:31,410
 similar in price all was different was

1816
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:31,410
 

1817
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:34,260
 the school they went to or if there's a

1818
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,260
 

1819
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:35,910
 test score criterion for getting into a

1820
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,910
 

1821
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:37,950
 school we look at people whose test

1822
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,950
 

1823
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:41,070
 scores were just below the cutoff so

1824
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:41,070
 

1825
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:43,260
 those we look at it people whose incomes

1826
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:43,260
 

1827
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:45,360
 like just qualified them or just didn't

1828
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:45,360
 

1829
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:46,320
 qualify them for a program and so on of

1830
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:46,320
 

1831
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,880
 course there can be a lot of problems

1832
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:47,880
 

1833
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,560
 with these as well each of these

1834
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:49,560
 

1835
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,390
 examples I just gave you can think of

1836
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,390
 

1837
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:54,360
 reasons that would go wrong but that's a

1838
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:54,360
 

1839
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:56,460
 very very popular type of strategy and

1840
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:56,460
 

1841
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:58,950
 in fact for tech firms you can think

1842
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:58,950
 

1843
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:00,960
 about designing these types of

1844
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,960
 

1845
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:03,000
 experiments so Hal Varian Google's chief

1846
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:03,000
 

1847
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,370
 economist recently wrote a paper with

1848
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:05,370
 

1849
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,590
 art owen from stanford about this and he

1850
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,590
 

1851
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:09,180
 was sort of arguing that hey like in

1852
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,180
 

1853
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:11,400
 youtube you know they give them free

1854
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:11,400
 

1855
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:13,620
 t-shirts if they get them enough likes

1856
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,620
 

1857
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,570
 on their video so instead of just having

1858
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:15,570
 

1859
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:17,300
 a hard cutoff like if you get more than

1860
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,300
 

1861
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:19,710
 ten thousand likes i send you a t-shirt

1862
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:19,710
 

1863
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:22,020
 instead i should take all the people

1864
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,020
 

1865
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:23,700
 near a 10,000 and randomize them and

1866
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:23,700
 

1867
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:25,410
 then i would get even more statistical

1868
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:25,410
 

1869
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:27,300
 power from that program and i could

1870
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,300
 

1871
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:28,590
 actually learn whether t-shirts help or

1872
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:28,590
 

1873
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:31,860
 whether google's wasting their money

1874
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:31,860
 

1875
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:32,820
 sending people all these t-shirts so

1876
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:32,820
 

1877
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:35,190
 that's the regression discontinuity

1878
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:35,190
 

1879
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:37,230
 design the difference-in-difference

1880
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,230
 

1881
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:39,900
 design and it's closely related to

1882
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,900
 

1883
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:43,140
 looking at longitudinal data a classic

1884
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:43,140
 

1885
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:46,530
 example of this would be like say Kansas

1886
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:46,530
 

1887
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:48,030
 had this tax reform so you of course the

1888
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,030
 

1889
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:49,560
 world is changing the economy is

1890
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,560
 

1891
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:51,420
 changing you're coming out of a Great

1892
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:51,420
 

1893
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:53,040
 Recession but you can look at states

1894
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:53,040
 

1895
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:56,190
 that are a lot like Kansas

1896
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:56,190
 

1897
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:58,980
 and look at their time trends and then

1898
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:58,980
 

1899
00:39:56,190 --> 00:40:00,930
 Kansas at some point Plus is tax reform

1900
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:00,930
 

1901
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:03,120
 and you can see how its outcomes kind of

1902
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,120
 

1903
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:05,640
 go downhill relative to the time trend

1904
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:05,640
 

1905
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:09,090
 that was established by the other firms

1906
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:09,090
 

1907
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:10,680
 and this area is one that's seeing a lot

1908
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,680
 

1909
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:12,180
 of activity right now in terms of

1910
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:12,180
 

1911
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:13,290
 bringing together machine learning

1912
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:13,290
 

1913
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:15,060
 methods particularly matrix

1914
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,060
 

1915
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:16,350
 factorization methods and causal

1916
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:16,350
 

1917
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:18,960
 inference methods and that's something

1918
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,960
 

1919
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:20,280
 I've of some papers on you can find on

1920
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,280
 

1921
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,700
 my website I'm not going to talk about

1922
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:23,700
 

1923
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:26,730
 that anymore today okay

1924
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:26,730
 

1925
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:28,470
 approach to and I should say in

1926
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,470
 

1927
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:29,820
 economics the people who do approach one

1928
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,820
 

1929
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:32,760
 and the people who do approach two

1930
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:32,760
 

1931
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:33,570
 generally are not friends they kind of

1932
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:33,570
 

1933
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,970
 argue a lot

1934
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,970
 

1935
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:38,240
 so I've done both in my career but not

1936
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,240
 

1937
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:40,890
 that many people kind of essentially

1938
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:40,890
 

1939
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:43,530
 historically did both now it's becoming

1940
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,530
 

1941
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:44,970
 a bit more common so structural

1942
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,970
 

1943
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:47,100
 estimation the way the structural

1944
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,100
 

1945
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:49,410
 estimation people would say is that they

1946
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:49,410
 

1947
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:52,110
 make more assumptions but they also

1948
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,110
 

1949
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:54,510
 answer more interesting questions so at

1950
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,510
 

1951
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:57,150
 some level the first the first approach

1952
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:57,150
 

1953
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:58,650
 is only good for comparing people who

1954
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,650
 

1955
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:00,720
 got something and people who didn't get

1956
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,720
 

1957
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:02,910
 something and you can just measure

1958
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:02,910
 

1959
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:06,120
 outcomes the goal of structural

1960
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:06,120
 

1961
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:07,650
 estimation is more than that it's to be

1962
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:07,650
 

1963
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:11,040
 able to think about worlds we haven't

1964
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:11,040
 

1965
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:13,950
 seen before and also to say something

1966
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:13,950
 

1967
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:15,660
 about welfare I want to understand if I

1968
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,660
 

1969
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:18,030
 raise the price what's that gonna do to

1970
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:18,030
 

1971
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:20,430
 consumer welfare what's that gonna do to

1972
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,430
 

1973
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:21,990
 firm profits okay and these kinds of

1974
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,990
 

1975
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:25,020
 models have also been used for decades

1976
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:25,020
 

1977
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:26,670
 in like any trust cases so staples and

1978
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:26,670
 

1979
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:28,320
 Office Depot want to merge some

1980
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,320
 

1981
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:29,610
 economist is going to get paid hundreds

1982
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:29,610
 

1983
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,980
 of thousands of dollars to write a

1984
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,980
 

1985
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:34,230
 report building a little model that says

1986
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:34,230
 

1987
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:35,640
 you know well if these two merge this is

1988
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,640
 

1989
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:36,720
 how they're gonna change their prices

1990
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:36,720
 

1991
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:39,630
 and that's what it's gonna do to

1992
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:39,630
 

1993
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:41,370
 consumer welfare the area that I worked

1994
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:41,370
 

1995
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:43,830
 on this most historically was in

1996
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,830
 

1997
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:45,900
 auctions but I'll show you an example at

1998
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,900
 

1999
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:50,550
 the end of doing that now I'm working

2000
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:50,550
 

2001
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:54,180
 with David Bly on and on models of

2002
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:54,180
 

2003
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:55,920
 pricing so what would happen to her if

2004
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:55,920
 

2005
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:57,570
 firm to firm demand of price increases

2006
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:57,570
 

2007
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,150
 what would happen to prices consumption

2008
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,150
 

2009
00:41:57,570 --> 00:42:01,560
 and welfare of two firms merge what

2010
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:01,560
 

2011
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:03,510
 would happen to platform revenue

2012
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:03,510
 

2013
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:05,680
 advertiser profits and consumer welfare

2014
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,680
 

2015
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:07,060
 if Google switched from a general I

2016
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:07,060
 

2017
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,830
 second price auction to a victory

2018
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:08,830
 

2019
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:10,720
 auction and that's a change after that

2020
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,720
 

2021
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:12,250
 Facebook may at some point and you know

2022
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:12,250
 

2023
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:15,060
 those of us working in this literature

2024
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,060
 

2025
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:17,800
 you know discuss the hood at the time

2026
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:17,800
 

2027
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:19,960
 okay so how does this work

2028
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:19,960
 

2029
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:22,240
 well our goal is to estimate this impact

2030
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:22,240
 

2031
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:24,130
 on welfare profits of participants and

2032
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:24,130
 

2033
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:26,320
 on alternative counterfactual regimes

2034
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,320
 

2035
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:28,990
 and these regimes may never have been

2036
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:28,990
 

2037
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:30,550
 seen before so how could you possibly do

2038
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,550
 

2039
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:32,470
 that I remember when I first explained

2040
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,470
 

2041
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:34,840
 this to friends at Microsoft you know 10

2042
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:34,840
 

2043
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:37,060
 years ago when I finally convinced them

2044
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:37,060
 

2045
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:39,730
 of what I was doing they're like you're

2046
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:39,730
 

2047
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:41,410
 smoking dope that can't be science how

2048
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,410
 

2049
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:43,120
 could there be a science where you're

2050
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,120
 

2051
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:45,100
 claiming to make a prediction about a

2052
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:45,100
 

2053
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:47,620
 world you haven't seen before how could

2054
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:47,620
 

2055
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:48,970
 you possibly do that and the answer is

2056
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:48,970
 

2057
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:51,880
 you can only do that with some

2058
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,880
 

2059
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:53,620
 assumptions but in some cases you can

2060
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:53,620
 

2061
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:55,480
 make assumptions that make a lot of

2062
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:55,480
 

2063
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:58,120
 sense and of course your artificial

2064
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:58,120
 

2065
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:00,130
 intelligence agents are gonna have to do

2066
00:42:58,110 --> 00:43:00,130
 

2067
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:02,260
 that they have to reason about worlds

2068
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,260
 

2069
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:07,210
 they haven't seen before and so we're

2070
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:07,210
 

2071
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:09,400
 all kind of in this business okay so you

2072
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,400
 

2073
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:11,080
 need basically a behavioral model for

2074
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:11,080
 

2075
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:14,620
 the participants you need to understand

2076
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:14,620
 

2077
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:17,560
 why the agents in your in your data are

2078
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:17,560
 

2079
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:19,120
 doing what they're doing so for example

2080
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:19,120
 

2081
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:21,520
 I could assume that when you go in the

2082
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:21,520
 

2083
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:22,960
 supermarket and you choose a cereal

2084
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:22,960
 

2085
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,450
 you're choosing the one that maximizes

2086
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:25,450
 

2087
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,830
 your utility that's a behavioral

2088
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,830
 

2089
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:28,660
 assumption you chose the one that

2090
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:28,660
 

2091
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:30,610
 maximizes your utility of course I could

2092
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:30,610
 

2093
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:32,320
 also imagine that you don't gather all

2094
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,320
 

2095
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:33,910
 the information or that you're sloppy

2096
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:33,910
 

2097
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:35,560
 there's lots of other assumptions I

2098
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,560
 

2099
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:37,090
 could make the starting behavioral

2100
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:37,090
 

2101
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:39,130
 assumption we would make is that you're

2102
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,130
 

2103
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:40,900
 maximizing your utility so if there were

2104
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,900
 

2105
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:43,240
 two cereals it's offered at different

2106
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:43,240
 

2107
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:44,830
 prices if you took one of them you must

2108
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:44,830
 

2109
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:47,200
 have liked that better than the one that

2110
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:47,200
 

2111
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:49,180
 you didn't take and from that I can

2112
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:49,180
 

2113
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:51,040
 learn something about your preferences

2114
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:51,040
 

2115
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:53,050
 you call that revealed preference your

2116
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:53,050
 

2117
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:56,020
 choices reveal something about your

2118
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,020
 

2119
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:57,850
 preferences of course we still need

2120
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:57,850
 

2121
00:43:56,020 --> 00:44:00,340
 designs and enable identification and

2122
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,340
 

2123
00:43:57,850 --> 00:44:02,230
 estimation so for example if I want to

2124
00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:02,230
 

2125
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:03,250
 learn about people's responsiveness to

2126
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:03,250
 

2127
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:05,140
 price changes

2128
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,140
 

2129
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:07,270
 I still need there to have been price

2130
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:07,270
 

2131
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:09,040
 changes in my historical data and I

2132
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:09,040
 

2133
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:11,700
 still need the right kind of variation

2134
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:11,700
 

2135
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:14,470
 say quasi random variation in the data

2136
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:14,470
 

2137
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:16,540
 but I'm gonna go farther with these

2138
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:16,540
 

2139
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:17,509
 models I'm gonna rely on the behavioral

2140
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:17,509
 

2141
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:20,029
 model

2142
00:44:17,499 --> 00:44:20,029
 

2143
00:44:17,509 --> 00:44:22,609
 to to estimate what you would do in

2144
00:44:20,019 --> 00:44:22,609
 

2145
00:44:20,029 --> 00:44:23,719
 different circumstances if I know if I

2146
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:23,719
 

2147
00:44:22,609 --> 00:44:26,149
 suppose I watch you go to the

2148
00:44:23,709 --> 00:44:26,149
 

2149
00:44:23,719 --> 00:44:28,249
 supermarket over 18 months which I do in

2150
00:44:26,139 --> 00:44:28,249
 

2151
00:44:26,149 --> 00:44:31,159
 some of my papers over time I'm gonna

2152
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:31,159
 

2153
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:33,499
 learn how you feel about prices so I can

2154
00:44:31,149 --> 00:44:33,499
 

2155
00:44:31,159 --> 00:44:35,689
 predict what would happen if a price

2156
00:44:33,489 --> 00:44:35,689
 

2157
00:44:33,499 --> 00:44:37,309
 changed I can say that you're very

2158
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:37,309
 

2159
00:44:35,689 --> 00:44:39,259
 price-sensitive if this price goes up

2160
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:39,259
 

2161
00:44:37,309 --> 00:44:40,579
 I've never seen you with that price

2162
00:44:39,249 --> 00:44:40,579
 

2163
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:42,919
 before but I don't think you're gonna

2164
00:44:40,569 --> 00:44:42,919
 

2165
00:44:40,579 --> 00:44:44,569
 buy and so in this particular data set

2166
00:44:42,909 --> 00:44:44,569
 

2167
00:44:42,919 --> 00:44:46,369
 we have prices changing every week and

2168
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:46,369
 

2169
00:44:44,569 --> 00:44:48,139
 so we do hold out data where prices

2170
00:44:46,359 --> 00:44:48,139
 

2171
00:44:46,369 --> 00:44:50,419
 change and we show that indeed we do a

2172
00:44:48,129 --> 00:44:50,419
 

2173
00:44:48,139 --> 00:44:54,339
 good job at figuring out who buys and

2174
00:44:50,409 --> 00:44:54,339
 

2175
00:44:50,419 --> 00:44:56,989
 who doesn't buy when the price goes up

2176
00:44:54,329 --> 00:44:56,989
 

2177
00:44:54,339 --> 00:44:58,639
 now I'm not gonna be able to talk about

2178
00:44:56,979 --> 00:44:58,639
 

2179
00:44:56,989 --> 00:45:01,399
 this I'm too much today but there's a

2180
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:01,399
 

2181
00:44:58,639 --> 00:45:05,359
 really lovely paper by a young economist

2182
00:45:01,389 --> 00:45:05,359
 

2183
00:45:01,399 --> 00:45:07,159
 at Yale named egami and he actually does

2184
00:45:05,349 --> 00:45:07,159
 

2185
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:09,139
 a nice job here's a little paper that's

2186
00:45:07,149 --> 00:45:09,139
 

2187
00:45:07,159 --> 00:45:11,209
 basically artificial intelligence as

2188
00:45:09,129 --> 00:45:11,209
 

2189
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:12,949
 structural estimation the paper is

2190
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:12,949
 

2191
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:14,659
 written for economists and it's

2192
00:45:12,939 --> 00:45:14,659
 

2193
00:45:12,949 --> 00:45:18,889
 basically showing how things like

2194
00:45:14,649 --> 00:45:18,889
 

2195
00:45:14,659 --> 00:45:20,089
 alphago are using what what would be

2196
00:45:18,879 --> 00:45:20,089
 

2197
00:45:18,889 --> 00:45:21,769
 known in a machine learning as inverse

2198
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:21,769
 

2199
00:45:20,089 --> 00:45:23,059
 machine reinforcement learning and what

2200
00:45:21,759 --> 00:45:23,059
 

2201
00:45:21,769 --> 00:45:25,279
 we've talked about is dynamic

2202
00:45:23,049 --> 00:45:25,279
 

2203
00:45:23,059 --> 00:45:28,099
 programming value function iteration

2204
00:45:25,269 --> 00:45:28,099
 

2205
00:45:25,279 --> 00:45:31,999
 policy function iteration and so on in

2206
00:45:28,089 --> 00:45:31,999
 

2207
00:45:28,099 --> 00:45:33,529
 in economics now we there's some

2208
00:45:31,989 --> 00:45:33,529
 

2209
00:45:31,999 --> 00:45:35,659
 question about what how much value

2210
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:35,659
 

2211
00:45:33,529 --> 00:45:38,029
 making that mapping works in the stuff

2212
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:38,029
 

2213
00:45:35,659 --> 00:45:39,380
 examples I'm going to show you today I'm

2214
00:45:38,019 --> 00:45:39,380
 

2215
00:45:38,029 --> 00:45:41,479
 going to show you how I think I can make

2216
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:41,479
 

2217
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:43,579
 AI better by being better statisticians

2218
00:45:41,469 --> 00:45:43,579
 

2219
00:45:41,479 --> 00:45:46,279
 we have some ideas about how I could

2220
00:45:43,569 --> 00:45:46,279
 

2221
00:45:43,579 --> 00:45:47,749
 make alphago better by also thinking

2222
00:45:46,269 --> 00:45:47,749
 

2223
00:45:46,279 --> 00:45:49,279
 about it the way that that we've thought

2224
00:45:47,739 --> 00:45:49,279
 

2225
00:45:47,749 --> 00:45:51,949
 about it but I think it's a little bit

2226
00:45:49,269 --> 00:45:51,949
 

2227
00:45:49,279 --> 00:45:53,719
 less clear you know whether or not those

2228
00:45:51,939 --> 00:45:53,719
 

2229
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:58,369
 improvements will materialize and how

2230
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:58,369
 

2231
00:45:53,719 --> 00:46:00,259
 important they will be so another type

2232
00:45:58,359 --> 00:46:00,259
 

2233
00:45:58,369 --> 00:46:01,969
 of counterfactual inference causal

2234
00:46:00,249 --> 00:46:01,969
 

2235
00:46:00,259 --> 00:46:04,369
 discovery or learning the causal graph

2236
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:04,369
 

2237
00:46:01,969 --> 00:46:07,549
 is about uncovering the causal nature of

2238
00:46:04,359 --> 00:46:07,549
 

2239
00:46:04,369 --> 00:46:10,729
 a system so and this actually bit mostly

2240
00:46:07,539 --> 00:46:10,729
 

2241
00:46:07,549 --> 00:46:11,959
 attributed to judea pearl and this is

2242
00:46:10,719 --> 00:46:11,959
 

2243
00:46:10,729 --> 00:46:13,249
 often what machine learning people when

2244
00:46:11,949 --> 00:46:13,249
 

2245
00:46:11,959 --> 00:46:14,719
 I say I'm working on causal inference

2246
00:46:13,239 --> 00:46:14,719
 

2247
00:46:13,249 --> 00:46:16,819
 people often think I'm working on this

2248
00:46:14,709 --> 00:46:16,819
 

2249
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:19,849
 this has actually not been the main

2250
00:46:16,809 --> 00:46:19,849
 

2251
00:46:16,819 --> 00:46:22,130
 focus of economics often because in

2252
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:22,130
 

2253
00:46:19,849 --> 00:46:23,899
 economics we're just answering like a

2254
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,899
 

2255
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:26,059
 much more simple question we want to

2256
00:46:23,889 --> 00:46:26,059
 

2257
00:46:23,899 --> 00:46:29,059
 know like did the minimum wage change

2258
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:29,059
 

2259
00:46:26,059 --> 00:46:30,350
 work and we already understand we have a

2260
00:46:29,049 --> 00:46:30,350
 

2261
00:46:29,059 --> 00:46:32,930
 model we have an economic

2262
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:32,930
 

2263
00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:34,520
 model that you know of how what causes

2264
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,520
 

2265
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:36,410
 what that if I raise the price people

2266
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:36,410
 

2267
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:38,060
 won't buy my stuff if I raise the

2268
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,060
 

2269
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:40,190
 minimum wage you know certain things

2270
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:40,190
 

2271
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:41,960
 will happen so I kind of understand

2272
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:41,960
 

2273
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:44,210
 qualitatively how the world works

2274
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:44,210
 

2275
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:46,460
 I just don't know quantitatively and so

2276
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,460
 

2277
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:48,950
 in economics we've focused a lot on just

2278
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:48,950
 

2279
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:50,660
 estimating the magnitude of things and

2280
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,660
 

2281
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:53,090
 getting really precise estimates and

2282
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:53,090
 

2283
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:55,820
 unbiased estimates of magnitudes while

2284
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,820
 

2285
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:57,080
 for other applications that you often

2286
00:46:55,810 --> 00:46:57,080
 

2287
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:58,730
 just don't really understand how the

2288
00:46:57,070 --> 00:46:58,730
 

2289
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,650
 world works at all I have some big

2290
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,650
 

2291
00:46:58,730 --> 00:47:02,420
 software a program and there's lots of

2292
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,420
 

2293
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:03,740
 variables and I don't know which ones

2294
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:03,740
 

2295
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:05,570
 cause what and I don't know what our

2296
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:05,570
 

2297
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:07,040
 inputs and what our outputs same with

2298
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,040
 

2299
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:09,290
 the human body I just don't really

2300
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:09,290
 

2301
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,940
 understand how it works I have some idea

2302
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,940
 

2303
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:13,640
 that I start getting nervous and I start

2304
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:13,640
 

2305
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:15,590
 to to release some hormones and then I

2306
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:15,590
 

2307
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:18,230
 start to sweat and you know there's this

2308
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:18,230
 

2309
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:20,300
 this causal pathway as that my body goes

2310
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:20,300
 

2311
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:22,160
 through in response to stimuli but I

2312
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:22,160
 

2313
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:24,320
 don't understand what it is and so

2314
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:24,320
 

2315
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:26,270
 trying to discover the nature of causal

2316
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:26,270
 

2317
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:30,320
 relationships is really a very distinct

2318
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:30,320
 

2319
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:32,060
 subfield and so I'm also not going to go

2320
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:32,060
 

2321
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:33,920
 into that today partly because that's

2322
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:33,920
 

2323
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:35,600
 not what I work on and also there are

2324
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:35,600
 

2325
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:37,400
 there are other people who can speak

2326
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:37,400
 

2327
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:39,820
 much more clearly to that I've never

2328
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:39,820
 

2329
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:41,960
 done any applications in this area I

2330
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:41,960
 

2331
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:45,080
 would say recently these literature's

2332
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:45,080
 

2333
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:47,150
 have started coming together and all of

2334
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:47,150
 

2335
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:50,180
 these economic statistics computer

2336
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:50,180
 

2337
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:51,380
 science engineering all trying to come

2338
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:51,380
 

2339
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:53,630
 together and I think the really

2340
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:53,630
 

2341
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:56,360
 artificial intelligence and decision

2342
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:56,360
 

2343
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:59,300
 making personalized treatment policies

2344
00:47:56,350 --> 00:47:59,300
 

2345
00:47:56,360 --> 00:48:01,550
 all that stuff is unifying everyone and

2346
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:01,550
 

2347
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:03,290
 in pursuit of a common goal and so I

2348
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:03,290
 

2349
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:04,370
 would say the recent literature is

2350
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,370
 

2351
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:07,010
 really bringing causal reasoning

2352
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:07,010
 

2353
00:48:04,370 --> 00:48:08,960
 statistical theory and modern machine

2354
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,960
 

2355
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:12,230
 learning algorithms together to solve

2356
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:12,230
 

2357
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,850
 important problems so what are some of

2358
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:13,850
 

2359
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:15,740
 the themes of this literature

2360
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,740
 

2361
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:17,330
 first of all causal inference versus

2362
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:17,330
 

2363
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:19,550
 supervised learning as I mentioned

2364
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,550
 

2365
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:21,890
 supervised learning one of the amazing

2366
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:21,890
 

2367
00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:24,680
 like sociology of science points is like

2368
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,680
 

2369
00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:26,540
 how you know having all these images and

2370
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:26,540
 

2371
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:28,130
 being able to hold out a test set has

2372
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:28,130
 

2373
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:30,140
 led to the advancement of science if

2374
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,140
 

2375
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:32,170
 everybody could agree that if I do a

2376
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:32,170
 

2377
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:34,940
 better job telling cats and dogs by

2378
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,940
 

2379
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:37,130
 testing me in a test set we can all

2380
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:37,130
 

2381
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:38,840
 agree what progress is and we can make a

2382
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,840
 

2383
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:40,910
 lot of progress really fast

2384
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:40,910
 

2385
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:43,430
 I guess my cautionary note would be that

2386
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:43,430
 

2387
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:44,120
 most problems aren't like that like most

2388
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,120
 

2389
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:46,040
 problems you

2390
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:46,040
 

2391
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:49,040
 can't tell if you did a good job or not

2392
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:49,040
 

2393
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:51,440
 certainly not that kind of precisely and

2394
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:51,440
 

2395
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:53,240
 objectively you know as I said I would

2396
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:53,240
 

2397
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,770
 spend two years arguing with people

2398
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:54,770
 

2399
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:57,380
 about whether I got the right estimate

2400
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:57,380
 

2401
00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:58,760
 in an empirical paper and you know at

2402
00:48:57,370 --> 00:48:58,760
 

2403
00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:01,760
 the end half the people are unconvinced

2404
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:01,760
 

2405
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:03,170
 so we just you know the progress of

2406
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:03,170
 

2407
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:05,540
 understanding the impact of the minimum

2408
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,540
 

2409
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:06,950
 wage is like very very slow even though

2410
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:06,950
 

2411
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:08,870
 there's a bunch of really smart people

2412
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:08,870
 

2413
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:11,870
 devoting their whole careers just to

2414
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:11,870
 

2415
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:13,700
 that other problems you can go much

2416
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:13,700
 

2417
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:16,130
 faster if I have a billion iterations of

2418
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:16,130
 

2419
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:18,380
 a game I can see who won and lost and I

2420
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,380
 

2421
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:21,620
 can really understand what happened and

2422
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:21,620
 

2423
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:23,300
 what wins and what loses so the the

2424
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:23,300
 

2425
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:26,060
 causal inference is different because I

2426
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:26,060
 

2427
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:27,770
 don't have an observed ground truth now

2428
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:27,770
 

2429
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:29,780
 it turns out that we can make progress

2430
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,780
 

2431
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:32,180
 despite that and what the what our

2432
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:32,180
 

2433
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:34,610
 literature has done is figured out ways

2434
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:34,610
 

2435
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:37,910
 to estimate objective functions try to

2436
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:37,910
 

2437
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:40,130
 find is model free ways to estimate how

2438
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:40,130
 

2439
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:42,560
 well we've done that's hard to do it's

2440
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:42,560
 

2441
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:44,690
 noisier more prone to mistakes requires

2442
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:44,690
 

2443
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:47,690
 more assumptions than supervised machine

2444
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,690
 

2445
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:49,850
 learning but nonetheless we met we've

2446
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,850
 

2447
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:51,170
 been making good progress and basically

2448
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,170
 

2449
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:55,760
 the theme is we change the objective

2450
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:55,760
 

2451
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:57,680
 function another thing I said sampling

2452
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:57,680
 

2453
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,960
 variation matters and we care a lot more

2454
00:49:57,670 --> 00:49:59,960
 

2455
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:01,340
 about uncertainty quantification I would

2456
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:01,340
 

2457
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:03,860
 say that's a really important problem

2458
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:03,860
 

2459
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:06,590
 when I see firms going to apply AI some

2460
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:06,590
 

2461
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:08,570
 team builds this decision engine they

2462
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:08,570
 

2463
00:50:06,590 --> 00:50:09,950
 send it off to a loan officer the loan

2464
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,950
 

2465
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:13,220
 officer looks at it they see a

2466
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:13,220
 

2467
00:50:09,950 --> 00:50:15,920
 recommendation and they say that doesn't

2468
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:15,920
 

2469
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:17,660
 make sense to me you know and and nobody

2470
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:17,660
 

2471
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,670
 has told them whether that's an accurate

2472
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:19,670
 

2473
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:21,260
 assessment or not and so they just sort

2474
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:21,260
 

2475
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:23,690
 of distrust the whole machine because

2476
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:23,690
 

2477
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:26,210
 sometimes they get crazy answers and so

2478
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,210
 

2479
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:28,220
 that we need to as a community put more

2480
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,220
 

2481
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:29,510
 emphasis on what are the places where

2482
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:29,510
 

2483
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:31,460
 this algorithm is just gonna get things

2484
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,460
 

2485
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:33,230
 wrong maybe it's biased maybe there's

2486
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:33,230
 

2487
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:35,630
 emitted variables maybe it's just very

2488
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:35,630
 

2489
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:37,340
 uncertain and really expressed that

2490
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:37,340
 

2491
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:40,660
 uncertainty quantification that's been a

2492
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:40,660
 

2493
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:43,610
 big theme all along in causal inference

2494
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:43,610
 

2495
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:45,740
 we do require theoretical assumptions

2496
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,740
 

2497
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:47,000
 and domain knowledge and then one of the

2498
00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:47,000
 

2499
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:49,310
 things I've also been finding very

2500
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:49,310
 

2501
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,750
 interesting is that tuning a model for

2502
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:50,750
 

2503
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:52,220
 counterfactuals is actually very

2504
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:52,220
 

2505
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:54,050
 different than tuning a model for

2506
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:54,050
 

2507
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:56,690
 prediction you'll you're gonna choose

2508
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:56,690
 

2509
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:58,430
 different complexities of models

2510
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,430
 

2511
00:50:56,690 --> 00:50:59,990
 French different functional forms of

2512
00:50:58,420 --> 00:50:59,990
 

2513
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:01,220
 models all of your choices will be

2514
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:01,220
 

2515
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:02,810
 different if you're tuning for a

2516
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:02,810
 

2517
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:05,420
 counterfactual versus tuning for a

2518
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,420
 

2519
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:06,770
 prediction and indeed if in a simple

2520
00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:06,770
 

2521
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:08,839
 case like trying to understand the

2522
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,839
 

2523
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:11,540
 impact of changing price it's very

2524
00:51:08,829 --> 00:51:11,540
 

2525
00:51:08,839 --> 00:51:14,150
 common for for us to be able to in a

2526
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:14,150
 

2527
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:16,040
 simple correlation explain 95% of the

2528
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:16,040
 

2529
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:17,089
 variation if I regress hotel occupancy

2530
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:17,089
 

2531
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:19,190
 on price

2532
00:51:17,079 --> 00:51:19,190
 

2533
00:51:17,089 --> 00:51:20,869
 I can explain maybe 95 percent of the

2534
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:20,869
 

2535
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:22,910
 variation because the hotel's raise the

2536
00:51:20,859 --> 00:51:22,910
 

2537
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:24,859
 prices when they're full but if I wanted

2538
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:24,859
 

2539
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:27,260
 to get the causal impact I might be able

2540
00:51:24,849 --> 00:51:27,260
 

2541
00:51:24,859 --> 00:51:29,900
 to might have a you know an r-squared of

2542
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:29,900
 

2543
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:32,450
 like 0.01 or something because it's just

2544
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:32,450
 

2545
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:36,109
 much much harder to to get the causal

2546
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:36,109
 

2547
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:37,700
 effects the insights from statistics and

2548
00:51:36,099 --> 00:51:37,700
 

2549
00:51:36,109 --> 00:51:39,290
 econometrics so what are some of the

2550
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:39,290
 

2551
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:41,510
 things that that machine learning can

2552
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,510
 

2553
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:43,250
 learn first we usually start out by

2554
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,250
 

2555
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:45,500
 first thinking about identification and

2556
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,500
 

2557
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:47,060
 then estimation we first asked could we

2558
00:51:45,490 --> 00:51:47,060
 

2559
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:48,710
 solve our problem with infinite data

2560
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:48,710
 

2561
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:50,359
 that's what we call the identification

2562
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:50,359
 

2563
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:52,790
 question and that's a very helpful

2564
00:51:50,349 --> 00:51:52,790
 

2565
00:51:50,359 --> 00:51:54,829
 exercise because it forces you to think

2566
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:54,829
 

2567
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:56,780
 about what in the data could possibly

2568
00:51:54,819 --> 00:51:56,780
 

2569
00:51:54,829 --> 00:51:59,119
 answer my question for me and in many

2570
00:51:56,770 --> 00:51:59,119
 

2571
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:01,550
 cases the answer is I can't answer my

2572
00:51:59,109 --> 00:52:01,550
 

2573
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:03,140
 question this data set just doesn't have

2574
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:03,140
 

2575
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:05,119
 the right kind of quasi-experimental

2576
00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:05,119
 

2577
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:06,859
 variation to answer my causal question

2578
00:52:05,109 --> 00:52:06,859
 

2579
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:09,740
 all I can get is correlations even with

2580
00:52:06,849 --> 00:52:09,740
 

2581
00:52:06,859 --> 00:52:12,560
 infinite data we have a design based

2582
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:12,560
 

2583
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:15,530
 approach and then we we want to do

2584
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:15,530
 

2585
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:17,569
 estimation now where the big lift from

2586
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,569
 

2587
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:19,550
 machine learning has come is that now we

2588
00:52:17,559 --> 00:52:19,550
 

2589
00:52:17,569 --> 00:52:21,319
 have much more data and we have many

2590
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:21,319
 

2591
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:23,510
 more covariance and so machine learning

2592
00:52:21,309 --> 00:52:23,510
 

2593
00:52:21,319 --> 00:52:25,760
 has done a great job in figuring out how

2594
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,760
 

2595
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:27,170
 to do the best job in the most efficient

2596
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:27,170
 

2597
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:29,270
 job at making use of the data you have

2598
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:29,270
 

2599
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:31,069
 once you give it the right objective

2600
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:31,069
 

2601
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:33,980
 function a few other themes

2602
00:52:31,059 --> 00:52:33,980
 

2603
00:52:31,069 --> 00:52:35,990
 regularization induces emitted variable

2604
00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:35,990
 

2605
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:38,270
 bias so if you have two things that are

2606
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:38,270
 

2607
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:39,740
 highly correlated typically a model will

2608
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:39,740
 

2609
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:41,089
 choose one of them and not the other

2610
00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:41,089
 

2611
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:43,250
 because they're providing similar

2612
00:52:41,079 --> 00:52:43,250
 

2613
00:52:41,089 --> 00:52:45,530
 information but then that creates

2614
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:45,530
 

2615
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:46,940
 interpretability problems because say I

2616
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,940
 

2617
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:48,829
 have parents income and parents

2618
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:48,829
 

2619
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:50,420
 education I might do a variable

2620
00:52:48,819 --> 00:52:50,420
 

2621
00:52:48,829 --> 00:52:52,250
 importance thing and a random forest and

2622
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:52,250
 

2623
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:54,410
 say oh parents incomes important parents

2624
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,410
 

2625
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:56,390
 education is not which is like a silly

2626
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,390
 

2627
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:58,369
 conclusion because they're just highly

2628
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:58,369
 

2629
00:52:56,390 --> 00:53:00,859
 correlated with each other and most

2630
00:52:58,359 --> 00:53:00,859
 

2631
00:52:58,369 --> 00:53:02,869
 economic datasets and most firm datasets

2632
00:53:00,849 --> 00:53:02,869
 

2633
00:53:00,859 --> 00:53:04,310
 frankly all the variables about people

2634
00:53:02,859 --> 00:53:04,310
 

2635
00:53:02,869 --> 00:53:06,079
 are highly correlated with each other

2636
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:06,079
 

2637
00:53:04,310 --> 00:53:08,540
 and so I think people make a lot of

2638
00:53:06,069 --> 00:53:08,540
 

2639
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:10,560
 mistakes and interpretation when they

2640
00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:10,560
 

2641
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:12,240
 don't think about a mitad variable bias

2642
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:12,240
 

2643
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:14,400
 and it particularly challenges causal

2644
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:14,400
 

2645
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:16,140
 inference another thing and this I'll

2646
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:16,140
 

2647
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:18,300
 have to flesh out in my more technical

2648
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:18,300
 

2649
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:19,830
 part is it semi-parametric efficiency

2650
00:53:18,290 --> 00:53:19,830
 

2651
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:21,570
 theory which is a big literature in

2652
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:21,570
 

2653
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:23,460
 statistics and econometrics it can

2654
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:23,460
 

2655
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:25,110
 actually be very helpful and so we've

2656
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:25,110
 

2657
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:27,000
 been able to improve on the best known

2658
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:27,000
 

2659
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:28,380
 regret balance for machine learning by

2660
00:53:26,990 --> 00:53:28,380
 

2661
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,450
 bringing in the insights from

2662
00:53:28,370 --> 00:53:30,450
 

2663
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:32,600
 semi-parametric efficiency theory and

2664
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,600
 

2665
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:34,980
 changing machine learning algorithms and

2666
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:34,980
 

2667
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:37,110
 there's things we do call cross fitting

2668
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:37,110
 

2669
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:40,080
 and orthogonalization which basically

2670
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:40,080
 

2671
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:42,000
 make your models more robust to mistakes

2672
00:53:40,070 --> 00:53:42,000
 

2673
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:43,740
 that you make in estimating what we call

2674
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:43,740
 

2675
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,450
 nuisance parameters so if you're trying

2676
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:45,450
 

2677
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:47,670
 to get a causal effect there's things

2678
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,670
 

2679
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:49,290
 like just estimating an outcome model

2680
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:49,290
 

2681
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:51,480
 predicting what your outcomes would be

2682
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,480
 

2683
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:53,310
 not your treatment effects and for those

2684
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:53,310
 

2685
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:55,260
 outcome models you try to residual eyes

2686
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:55,260
 

2687
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:58,740
 everything so that mistakes you make and

2688
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:58,740
 

2689
00:53:55,260 --> 00:54:00,960
 that estimation or orthogonal to the

2690
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:00,960
 

2691
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:02,550
 problem you're really interested in and

2692
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:02,550
 

2693
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:05,600
 it turns out that increases performance

2694
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:05,600
 

2695
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:08,970
 a lot and also improves the theory

2696
00:54:05,590 --> 00:54:08,970
 

2697
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:10,380
 finally I would say that using the

2698
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,380
 

2699
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:12,480
 exploiting the structure of the problem

2700
00:54:10,370 --> 00:54:12,480
 

2701
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:14,700
 carefully for better counterfactual

2702
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:14,700
 

2703
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:16,470
 predictions so a lot of the old people

2704
00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:16,470
 

2705
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:18,360
 and I'll call myself an old people since

2706
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:18,360
 

2707
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:20,940
 since I started in computer science in

2708
00:54:18,350 --> 00:54:20,940
 

2709
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:23,240
 the 80s I do have a computer science

2710
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:23,240
 

2711
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:25,950
 degree before I abandon it for economics

2712
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:25,950
 

2713
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:28,890
 you know we get a little grumpy about

2714
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:28,890
 

2715
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:30,450
 all these black box algorithms and to my

2716
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,450
 

2717
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:32,610
 economist friends I'm trying to

2718
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:32,610
 

2719
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:34,230
 evangelize the black box algorithms but

2720
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,230
 

2721
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:35,730
 those old folks are a little grumpy

2722
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:35,730
 

2723
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:37,230
 because we used to spend a lot of time

2724
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,230
 

2725
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:39,960
 thinking about modeling and generative

2726
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:39,960
 

2727
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:42,210
 modeling but I would argue that if

2728
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:42,210
 

2729
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:44,670
 you're really going to do heart AI or

2730
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,670
 

2731
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:46,620
 human-like AI we do have to go back to

2732
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:46,620
 

2733
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:48,780
 the models and we're going to use the

2734
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:48,780
 

2735
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:51,300
 black boxes for components of those

2736
00:54:48,770 --> 00:54:51,300
 

2737
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:53,010
 models but we're gonna use structure

2738
00:54:51,290 --> 00:54:53,010
 

2739
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:54,960
 because you want to be able to make

2740
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,960
 

2741
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:56,760
 sensible decisions in states of the

2742
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:56,760
 

2743
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,590
 world you haven't seen before and a lot

2744
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:58,590
 

2745
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:00,690
 of times that structure really helps so

2746
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:00,690
 

2747
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:03,450
 in my supermarket analysis for example

2748
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:03,450
 

2749
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:04,920
 it just really helps to say hey we have

2750
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:04,920
 

2751
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:06,420
 these functional forums that tell us

2752
00:55:04,910 --> 00:55:06,420
 

2753
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:07,680
 something about like if the price of

2754
00:55:06,410 --> 00:55:07,680
 

2755
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:09,030
 this goes up how are you gonna

2756
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:09,030
 

2757
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:12,570
 substitute to other types of paper

2758
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:12,570
 

2759
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:15,000
 towels how do I use the past behavior in

2760
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:15,000
 

2761
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:17,430
 a structured way and those models have

2762
00:55:14,990 --> 00:55:17,430
 

2763
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,170
 been super successful over decades and I

2764
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:19,170
 

2765
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:20,670
 can beat the best machine often you know

2766
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,670
 

2767
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:22,800
 kind of reduce foreign machine learning

2768
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:22,800
 

2769
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:23,610
 methods just black box by incorporating

2770
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:23,610
 

2771
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,830
 a little structure

2772
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,830
 

2773
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:30,420
 and also using modern machine learning

2774
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:30,420
 

2775
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:32,280
 but I put them together ok so now I'm

2776
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:32,280
 

2777
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:34,380
 going to spend some time going into some

2778
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:34,380
 

2779
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:36,090
 very specific models and I'm going to

2780
00:55:34,370 --> 00:55:36,090
 

2781
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:39,030
 start getting progressively more

2782
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:39,030
 

2783
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:41,160
 technical so the first place and this is

2784
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:41,160
 

2785
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:42,540
 where a lot of the emphasis and causal

2786
00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:42,540
 

2787
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:43,620
 inference has been about estimating

2788
00:55:42,530 --> 00:55:43,620
 

2789
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:46,590
 average treatment effects under

2790
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:46,590
 

2791
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:49,200
 unconfoundedness and indeed for some

2792
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:49,200
 

2793
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:51,630
 folks in the causal inference land that

2794
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:51,630
 

2795
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:53,190
 aren't from social sciences they think

2796
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:53,190
 

2797
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:55,140
 this is the only thing that we ever do

2798
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:55,140
 

2799
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:57,420
 when I would say this is actually the

2800
00:55:55,130 --> 00:55:57,420
 

2801
00:55:55,140 --> 00:56:00,060
 least favorite way to do causal

2802
00:55:57,410 --> 00:56:00,060
 

2803
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:01,410
 inference and economics nonetheless and

2804
00:56:00,050 --> 00:56:01,410
 

2805
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:04,200
 in fact there's lots of people who think

2806
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:04,200
 

2807
00:56:01,410 --> 00:56:06,420
 we should never do this but I argue back

2808
00:56:04,190 --> 00:56:06,420
 

2809
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:08,160
 to them now tech firms are generating

2810
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:08,160
 

2811
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:09,600
 lots of the kinds of data that we would

2812
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:09,600
 

2813
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:12,270
 use that would satisfy the assumptions

2814
00:56:09,590 --> 00:56:12,270
 

2815
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:14,730
 required for this the studying to work

2816
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:14,730
 

2817
00:56:12,270 --> 00:56:16,590
 so the idea that only observational data

2818
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,590
 

2819
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:19,740
 is available that is we don't have a

2820
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:19,740
 

2821
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:22,080
 simple uniform experiment with a B

2822
00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:22,080
 

2823
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:24,210
 testing from the past the analyst has

2824
00:56:22,070 --> 00:56:24,210
 

2825
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:27,930
 access to data that is sufficient for

2826
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:27,930
 

2827
00:56:24,210 --> 00:56:30,000
 for that that that has the part of the

2828
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,000
 

2829
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:32,070
 the information used to assign trait

2830
00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:32,070
 

2831
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,560
 units to treatments and this related to

2832
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:34,560
 

2833
00:56:32,070 --> 00:56:36,330
 potential outcomes so for example a tech

2834
00:56:34,550 --> 00:56:36,330
 

2835
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:37,980
 firm might be deciding you know

2836
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,980
 

2837
00:56:36,330 --> 00:56:40,110
 Facebook's gonna show you something on

2838
00:56:37,970 --> 00:56:40,110
 

2839
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:43,230
 the newsfeed based on a bunch of

2840
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:43,230
 

2841
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:45,420
 characteristics and you know that that

2842
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:45,420
 

2843
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:47,160
 data is logged by Facebook the things

2844
00:56:45,410 --> 00:56:47,160
 

2845
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:49,620
 that go into their algorithm now their

2846
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:49,620
 

2847
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:51,690
 algorithm itself is a black box so they

2848
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:51,690
 

2849
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:53,100
 typically although in the ads we wish

2850
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,100
 

2851
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:55,590
 that they would if you're an advertiser

2852
00:56:53,090 --> 00:56:55,590
 

2853
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:57,870
 but typically firms don't actually log a

2854
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:57,870
 

2855
00:56:55,590 --> 00:57:00,180
 probability of assignment like suppose

2856
00:56:57,860 --> 00:57:00,180
 

2857
00:56:57,870 --> 00:57:01,890
 the firm was randomizing what you were

2858
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:01,890
 

2859
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:02,970
 gonna see they typically don't log the

2860
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:02,970
 

2861
00:57:01,890 --> 00:57:04,830
 probability because that would require

2862
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,830
 

2863
00:57:02,970 --> 00:57:06,120
 taking a lot of draws from the black box

2864
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:06,120
 

2865
00:57:04,830 --> 00:57:07,530
 and that would be expensive and why

2866
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:07,530
 

2867
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:09,120
 would you need to do that you just do

2868
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,120
 

2869
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:11,520
 one draw and show the something to the

2870
00:57:09,110 --> 00:57:11,520
 

2871
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:13,290
 person but as an analyst I can think of

2872
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:13,290
 

2873
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:15,840
 that as random and go back and look at

2874
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,840
 

2875
00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:17,550
 it later and of course it's a computer

2876
00:57:15,830 --> 00:57:17,550
 

2877
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:20,520
 algorithm so whatever was used an

2878
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:20,520
 

2879
00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:22,770
 assignment must have been recorded at

2880
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:22,770
 

2881
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:24,270
 some point but the analyst doesn't know

2882
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,270
 

2883
00:57:22,770 --> 00:57:25,920
 the exact assignment rule and there was

2884
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:25,920
 

2885
00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:27,810
 some randomness in this setting

2886
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:27,810
 

2887
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:30,450
 conditional on the observables we have

2888
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:30,450
 

2889
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:32,580
 random assignment but the the simon is

2890
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:32,580
 

2891
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:34,320
 not uniform so people for whom i thought

2892
00:57:32,570 --> 00:57:34,320
 

2893
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:35,970
 the ad would be effective we're probably

2894
00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:35,970
 

2895
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:38,190
 more likely to be shown the ad than

2896
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:38,190
 

2897
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:40,170
 people who were not

2898
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:40,170
 

2899
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:42,480
 contextual bandit data is another good

2900
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,480
 

2901
00:57:40,170 --> 00:57:44,220
 example if the tech firm is itself

2902
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:44,220
 

2903
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:45,930
 running a contextual bandit or the

2904
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:45,930
 

2905
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:47,670
 political campaign is using a collect

2906
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,670
 

2907
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:49,950
 contextual bandit to say I'm gonna map

2908
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:49,950
 

2909
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:52,680
 your characteristics to the email I send

2910
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:52,680
 

2911
00:57:49,950 --> 00:57:55,560
 you then I would generate data like this

2912
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:55,560
 

2913
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:57,570
 and then the question is you know what

2914
00:57:55,550 --> 00:57:57,570
 

2915
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:59,550
 what's the treatment effect so for an

2916
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:59,550
 

2917
00:57:57,570 --> 00:58:01,770
 online ad we could say ads are targeted

2918
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:01,770
 

2919
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:04,050
 using cookies a user sees car ads

2920
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:04,050
 

2921
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:06,180
 because the advertiser knows the user

2922
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:06,180
 

2923
00:58:04,050 --> 00:58:07,800
 visited car review websites but there's

2924
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:07,800
 

2925
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:10,050
 still some randomness as to whether you

2926
00:58:07,790 --> 00:58:10,050
 

2927
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:12,030
 saw the ad even conditional on that and

2928
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:12,030
 

2929
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:14,880
 so the interest in the cars is the

2930
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:14,880
 

2931
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:16,410
 unobserved confounder but if the analyst

2932
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:16,410
 

2933
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:18,360
 can observe the history of websites

2934
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,360
 

2935
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:20,250
 visited by the user which is the same

2936
00:58:18,350 --> 00:58:20,250
 

2937
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:22,020
 thing that was used for targeting than

2938
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,020
 

2939
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:26,130
 in principle I can control for those

2940
00:58:22,010 --> 00:58:26,130
 

2941
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:28,230
 things and do in do causal inference so

2942
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:28,230
 

2943
00:58:26,130 --> 00:58:29,880
 in this setup what we what we would

2944
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:29,880
 

2945
00:58:28,230 --> 00:58:31,710
 formalize these assumptions as

2946
00:58:29,870 --> 00:58:31,710
 

2947
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:33,660
 uncompounded Nisour it's also called

2948
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:33,660
 

2949
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:35,640
 ignore ability and basically what that

2950
00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:35,640
 

2951
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:38,820
 says is that conditional on some

2952
00:58:35,630 --> 00:58:38,820
 

2953
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:40,710
 covariates X the potential outcomes that

2954
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:40,710
 

2955
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:43,170
 you would have received from seeing the

2956
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:43,170
 

2957
00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:45,300
 ad or not seeing the ad were independent

2958
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:45,300
 

2959
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:46,470
 of the treatment and so some of the

2960
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:46,470
 

2961
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:48,630
 things that could lead to randomness

2962
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:48,630
 

2963
00:58:46,470 --> 00:58:50,430
 could be like running out of budget or

2964
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:50,430
 

2965
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:52,320
 like a firm has a limited budget and so

2966
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:52,320
 

2967
00:58:50,430 --> 00:58:55,140
 they might only show the ads to half the

2968
00:58:52,310 --> 00:58:55,140
 

2969
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:55,860
 people or competitors might be running

2970
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:55,860
 

2971
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:57,320
 out of budget

2972
00:58:55,850 --> 00:58:57,320
 

2973
00:58:55,860 --> 00:59:00,480
 there's lots of things that could be

2974
00:58:57,310 --> 00:59:00,480
 

2975
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:02,370
 could be leading to that randomness this

2976
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:02,370
 

2977
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:05,040
 notation is the potential outcomes

2978
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:05,040
 

2979
00:59:02,370 --> 00:59:07,980
 notation and this Y I of 1 and Y I of 0

2980
00:59:05,030 --> 00:59:07,980
 

2981
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:09,960
 are these counterfactual outcomes for

2982
00:59:07,970 --> 00:59:09,960
 

2983
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:11,550
 each of you there's a counterfactual

2984
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:11,550
 

2985
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:13,200
 outcome what you would have had if you

2986
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:13,200
 

2987
00:59:11,550 --> 00:59:15,270
 didn't see the ad and what you would

2988
00:59:13,190 --> 00:59:15,270
 

2989
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:17,010
 have had if you didn't see the ad even

2990
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,010
 

2991
00:59:15,270 --> 00:59:18,570
 though I'm never gonna observe both of

2992
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,570
 

2993
00:59:17,010 --> 00:59:21,240
 those for the same person at the same

2994
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:21,240
 

2995
00:59:18,570 --> 00:59:22,680
 time those exists hypothetically and so

2996
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:22,680
 

2997
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:24,720
 it's really important to write those

2998
00:59:22,670 --> 00:59:24,720
 

2999
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:26,670
 down because that's what allows us to

3000
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:26,670
 

3001
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:29,190
 distinguish correlation from causality

3002
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:29,190
 

3003
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:30,870
 and to write down the objects of

3004
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:30,870
 

3005
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:32,370
 interest our object of interest a

3006
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:32,370
 

3007
00:59:30,870 --> 00:59:34,140
 treatment effect would be the difference

3008
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,140
 

3009
00:59:32,370 --> 00:59:36,690
 between your outcome of treated and your

3010
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:36,690
 

3011
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:39,090
 outcome with not treated we need there

3012
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:39,090
 

3013
00:59:36,690 --> 00:59:41,310
 to be enough randomness that for every

3014
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:41,310
 

3015
00:59:39,090 --> 00:59:43,410
 type of person there was some chance you

3016
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:43,410
 

3017
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:44,910
 saw the ad in some chance you didn't so

3018
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:44,910
 

3019
00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:47,430
 if there's people that just never get

3020
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:47,430
 

3021
00:59:44,910 --> 00:59:48,870
 shown car ads we just can't say anything

3022
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:48,870
 

3023
00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:49,720
 about what would have happened if we did

3024
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:49,720
 

3025
00:59:48,870 --> 00:59:51,280
 show them the car

3026
00:59:49,710 --> 00:59:51,280
 

3027
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:53,320
 so we should just throw them out we

3028
00:59:51,270 --> 00:59:53,320
 

3029
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:55,450
 can't say anything about them we would

3030
00:59:53,310 --> 00:59:55,450
 

3031
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:57,250
 have to extrapolate too much but if

3032
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,250
 

3033
00:59:55,450 --> 00:59:58,690
 there's people who had some chance of

3034
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:58,690
 

3035
00:59:57,250 --> 01:00:00,310
 seeing the ad based on their

3036
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:00,310
 

3037
00:59:58,690 --> 01:00:01,420
 characteristics then we can we can put

3038
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:01,420
 

3039
01:00:00,310 --> 01:00:03,580
 them in even if though it's not a high

3040
01:00:01,410 --> 01:00:03,580
 

3041
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:05,380
 chance and so the old literature from

3042
01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:05,380
 

3043
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:07,030
 the 80s basically shows that it's

3044
01:00:05,370 --> 01:00:07,030
 

3045
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:09,580
 sufficient to control for the propensity

3046
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:09,580
 

3047
01:00:07,030 --> 01:00:11,590
 score you don't have to control for the

3048
01:00:09,570 --> 01:00:11,590
 

3049
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:13,390
 whole vector of X's which is might be

3050
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:13,390
 

3051
01:00:11,590 --> 01:00:15,850
 hard and high dimensional the propensity

3052
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:15,850
 

3053
01:00:13,390 --> 01:00:17,410
 score is enough if I compare to people

3054
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:17,410
 

3055
01:00:15,850 --> 01:00:19,480
 that have the same probability of being

3056
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,480
 

3057
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:20,830
 treated then I can think of the

3058
01:00:19,470 --> 01:00:20,830
 

3059
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:22,780
 treatment assignment as being as good as

3060
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:22,780
 

3061
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:25,960
 random that's not completely obvious

3062
01:00:22,770 --> 01:00:25,960
 

3063
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:28,300
 it's a theorem it's a bits of paper and

3064
01:00:25,950 --> 01:00:28,300
 

3065
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:31,870
 you can find the algebra for all of that

3066
01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:31,870
 

3067
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:33,310
 in my lecture notes if you control for X

3068
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:33,310
 

3069
01:00:31,870 --> 01:00:35,530
 well then you can estimate the average

3070
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:35,530
 

3071
01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:38,770
 treatment effect and so there's a bunch

3072
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:38,770
 

3073
01:00:35,530 --> 01:00:40,240
 of popular methods used to try to

3074
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,240
 

3075
01:00:38,770 --> 01:00:42,970
 estimate treatment effects in that

3076
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:42,970
 

3077
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:45,700
 circumstance so I can maybe do this best

3078
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,700
 

3079
01:00:42,970 --> 01:00:48,790
 sort of visually here's a problem of a

3080
01:00:45,690 --> 01:00:48,790
 

3081
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:50,560
 data set and say the the Reds are

3082
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:50,560
 

3083
01:00:48,790 --> 01:00:53,650
 treated and the Purple's are controlled

3084
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:53,650
 

3085
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:54,790
 and here's a covariant X and so what

3086
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:54,790
 

3087
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:56,470
 we're seeing is it looks like the

3088
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:56,470
 

3089
01:00:54,790 --> 01:00:58,480
 treated guys are a little bit above the

3090
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:58,480
 

3091
01:00:56,470 --> 01:01:00,550
 control guys but it's a little hard to

3092
01:00:58,470 --> 01:01:00,550
 

3093
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:03,280
 tell because it also looks like x

3094
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:03,280
 

3095
01:01:00,550 --> 01:01:05,140
 increases outcomes and it looks like

3096
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:05,140
 

3097
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:08,350
 there's a few more treated guys with

3098
01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:08,350
 

3099
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:10,930
 high X's than with low X's so X is a

3100
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:10,930
 

3101
01:01:08,350 --> 01:01:12,580
 confounder it's it's correlated with

3102
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:12,580
 

3103
01:01:10,930 --> 01:01:15,640
 your outcome higher X makes you a higher

3104
01:01:12,570 --> 01:01:15,640
 

3105
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:17,050
 outcome and it's also seems to be

3106
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:17,050
 

3107
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:18,910
 correlated with the treatment assignment

3108
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,910
 

3109
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:21,010
 people with higher X also were more

3110
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:21,010
 

3111
01:01:18,910 --> 01:01:23,440
 likely to get the treatment so there's a

3112
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,440
 

3113
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:25,060
 few different ways to try to do causal

3114
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:25,060
 

3115
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:27,340
 inference in this setting the first

3116
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:27,340
 

3117
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:30,130
 thing you can do is just reweighed the

3118
01:01:27,330 --> 01:01:30,130
 

3119
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:32,290
 guy's so we can take the the guys with

3120
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:32,290
 

3121
01:01:30,130 --> 01:01:36,130
 high X's and I did this by hand so

3122
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:36,130
 

3123
01:01:32,290 --> 01:01:38,020
 apologies my blobs aren't perfect that

3124
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:38,020
 

3125
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:39,670
 you know the guys with higher X's in the

3126
01:01:38,010 --> 01:01:39,670
 

3127
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:41,830
 control group get weighted a little more

3128
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:41,830
 

3129
01:01:39,670 --> 01:01:44,080
 than the guys with low X's in the

3130
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:44,080
 

3131
01:01:41,830 --> 01:01:47,800
 control group and if I do reweighed

3132
01:01:44,070 --> 01:01:47,800
 

3133
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:49,720
 then I can I can basically adapt for the

3134
01:01:47,790 --> 01:01:49,720
 

3135
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:51,460
 fact that X was correlated with the

3136
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:51,460
 

3137
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:53,560
 treatment assignment and I can then

3138
01:01:51,450 --> 01:01:53,560
 

3139
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:55,420
 compare the weighted average of the

3140
01:01:53,550 --> 01:01:55,420
 

3141
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:57,490
 purple guys the control guys and say

3142
01:01:55,410 --> 01:01:57,490
 

3143
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:59,260
 well that's what would have happened to

3144
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:59,260
 

3145
01:01:57,490 --> 01:02:00,420
 the treatment guys if they hadn't been

3146
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:00,420
 

3147
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:03,180
 treated and the

3148
01:02:00,410 --> 01:02:03,180
 

3149
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:05,130
 would say okay if if this in the rebated

3150
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:05,130
 

3151
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:08,400
 average purple is lower than the rated

3152
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:08,400
 

3153
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:10,680
 is lower than the red average then

3154
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:10,680
 

3155
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:12,120
 there's a treatment effect so and this

3156
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:12,120
 

3157
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:14,520
 is ver it turns out this propensity

3158
01:02:12,110 --> 01:02:14,520
 

3159
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:16,410
 waiting has been very popular in machine

3160
01:02:14,510 --> 01:02:16,410
 

3161
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:18,390
 learning because there's we've already

3162
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,390
 

3163
01:02:16,410 --> 01:02:20,010
 had the idea of rewedding it's very easy

3164
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:20,010
 

3165
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:22,020
 to take a machine learning estimator and

3166
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,020
 

3167
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:23,970
 reweighed it off the shelf and so this

3168
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:23,970
 

3169
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:25,560
 has been the most popular application of

3170
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:25,560
 

3171
01:02:23,970 --> 01:02:27,510
 this causal inference literature in

3172
01:02:25,550 --> 01:02:27,510
 

3173
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:29,280
 machine learning is this kind of reading

3174
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:29,280
 

3175
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:30,720
 now unfortunately it turns out this is

3176
01:02:29,270 --> 01:02:30,720
 

3177
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:33,630
 not actually the best way to do things

3178
01:02:30,710 --> 01:02:33,630
 

3179
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:36,060
 even though it's popular it's

3180
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:36,060
 

3181
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:38,190
 conceptually easy another thing that you

3182
01:02:36,050 --> 01:02:38,190
 

3183
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:39,450
 can do is you can do outcome modeling so

3184
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:39,450
 

3185
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:40,920
 we could say let me just actually take

3186
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:40,920
 

3187
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:43,560
 the control group and I'm gonna estimate

3188
01:02:40,910 --> 01:02:43,560
 

3189
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:46,590
 the relationship between x and y and

3190
01:02:43,550 --> 01:02:46,590
 

3191
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:49,470
 then for every every unit i can sort of

3192
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:49,470
 

3193
01:02:46,590 --> 01:02:51,840
 adjust for the impact of X and once I've

3194
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:51,840
 

3195
01:02:49,470 --> 01:02:54,390
 adjusted for the impact of X then I can

3196
01:02:51,830 --> 01:02:54,390
 

3197
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:56,940
 compare the the treated outcomes and the

3198
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:56,940
 

3199
01:02:54,390 --> 01:02:58,740
 control outcomes this is this approach

3200
01:02:56,930 --> 01:02:58,740
 

3201
01:02:56,940 --> 01:03:00,630
 actually is implicitly used in a lot of

3202
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:00,630
 

3203
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:02,840
 the contextual bandit literature like

3204
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:02,840
 

3205
01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:06,510
 the linear Thompson sampling the the

3206
01:03:02,830 --> 01:03:06,510
 

3207
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:09,960
 lasso versions of Thompson sampling and

3208
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:09,960
 

3209
01:03:06,510 --> 01:03:12,330
 UCB these algorithms implicitly rely on

3210
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:12,330
 

3211
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:14,700
 outcome modeling they basically assume

3212
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:14,700
 

3213
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:16,500
 that you can run a regression and and

3214
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:16,500
 

3215
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:18,780
 understand the impact of having

3216
01:03:16,490 --> 01:03:18,780
 

3217
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:21,300
 different contexts and use that to draw

3218
01:03:18,770 --> 01:03:21,300
 

3219
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:22,860
 inferences about which arm to pull now

3220
01:03:21,290 --> 01:03:22,860
 

3221
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:25,590
 that's going to work okay but if you

3222
01:03:22,850 --> 01:03:25,590
 

3223
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:27,180
 don't have a lot of data then actually

3224
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:27,180
 

3225
01:03:25,590 --> 01:03:28,800
 there's a lot more control observations

3226
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:28,800
 

3227
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:31,620
 at low X's and so if this thing was

3228
01:03:28,790 --> 01:03:31,620
 

3229
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:33,810
 curved you might really screw up like if

3230
01:03:31,610 --> 01:03:33,810
 

3231
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:35,700
 the X if the if the purple average is a

3232
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,700
 

3233
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:37,590
 lot lower than the red average the

3234
01:03:35,690 --> 01:03:37,590
 

3235
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:39,660
 control guys have lower X's you would

3236
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:39,660
 

3237
01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:42,210
 really be extrapolating quite a long way

3238
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:42,210
 

3239
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:44,160
 to say what should be happening in the

3240
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:44,160
 

3241
01:03:42,210 --> 01:03:46,110
 hub region of high X and so if you have

3242
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:46,110
 

3243
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:48,120
 the wrong functional form you can go way

3244
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:48,120
 

3245
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:51,300
 wrong and that's why those models don't

3246
01:03:48,110 --> 01:03:51,300
 

3247
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:54,510
 perform as well as they could so the way

3248
01:03:51,290 --> 01:03:54,510
 

3249
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:56,340
 that's that's tipping tends to be the

3250
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:56,340
 

3251
01:03:54,510 --> 01:03:57,780
 highest performing from from this

3252
01:03:56,330 --> 01:03:57,780
 

3253
01:03:56,340 --> 01:04:00,900
 literature on causal inference is what's

3254
01:03:57,770 --> 01:04:00,900
 

3255
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:03,090
 called double robust estimation and then

3256
01:04:00,890 --> 01:04:03,090
 

3257
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:06,480
 what we do there is we both reweighed

3258
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:06,480
 

3259
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:08,130
 the data and use an outcome model and if

3260
01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:08,130
 

3261
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:10,890
 so if you think about it once I've done

3262
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:10,890
 

3263
01:04:08,130 --> 01:04:12,390
 readings I'm not extrapolating very far

3264
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,390
 

3265
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:12,950
 so if I get the slope of the line a

3266
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:12,950
 

3267
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:15,619
 little bit

3268
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:15,619
 

3269
01:04:12,950 --> 01:04:17,480
 wrong I'm not extrapolating very far and

3270
01:04:15,609 --> 01:04:17,480
 

3271
01:04:15,619 --> 01:04:19,430
 so it doesn't really matter if I get the

3272
01:04:17,470 --> 01:04:19,430
 

3273
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:21,470
 slope a little bit wrong because I'm I'm

3274
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:21,470
 

3275
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:24,079
 my average for the treated guys and

3276
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:24,079
 

3277
01:04:21,470 --> 01:04:27,290
 control guys is very similar on the

3278
01:04:24,069 --> 01:04:27,290
 

3279
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:29,180
 other hand if I do the outcome modeling

3280
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,180
 

3281
01:04:27,290 --> 01:04:31,280
 well then it doesn't matter if I do my

3282
01:04:29,170 --> 01:04:31,280
 

3283
01:04:29,180 --> 01:04:33,560
 rewriting very well because if I have if

3284
01:04:31,270 --> 01:04:33,560
 

3285
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:35,630
 I have a correct model mapping X's to

3286
01:04:33,550 --> 01:04:35,630
 

3287
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:37,250
 Y's then I can adjust for the effect of

3288
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:37,250
 

3289
01:04:35,630 --> 01:04:39,440
 X on Y's and I can control for the

3290
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:39,440
 

3291
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:41,510
 difference but if you combine outcome

3292
01:04:39,430 --> 01:04:41,510
 

3293
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:43,640
 modeling and re waiting then you can

3294
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:43,640
 

3295
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:45,950
 make some mistakes and both and do a

3296
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:45,950
 

3297
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:47,869
 better job and in a bandit you never

3298
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:47,869
 

3299
01:04:45,950 --> 01:04:49,640
 have enough data especially early on

3300
01:04:47,859 --> 01:04:49,640
 

3301
01:04:47,869 --> 01:04:51,530
 you're always in a data poor environment

3302
01:04:49,630 --> 01:04:51,530
 

3303
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:53,180
 therefore you you're never gonna have

3304
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,180
 

3305
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:54,740
 exactly the right model and so you're

3306
01:04:53,170 --> 01:04:54,740
 

3307
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:56,839
 always gonna get some benefit out of

3308
01:04:54,730 --> 01:04:56,839
 

3309
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:58,490
 doing this now if you did happen to have

3310
01:04:56,829 --> 01:04:58,490
 

3311
01:04:56,839 --> 01:05:00,349
 the right outcome model then the

3312
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,349
 

3313
01:04:58,490 --> 01:05:02,150
 rewedding will increase your variance so

3314
01:05:00,339 --> 01:05:02,150
 

3315
01:05:00,349 --> 01:05:03,920
 there in fact is a trade-off but in most

3316
01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:03,920
 

3317
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:05,480
 real-world settings you don't have the

3318
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:05,480
 

3319
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:08,720
 right outcome modeling and so you do

3320
01:05:05,470 --> 01:05:08,720
 

3321
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:11,780
 better by reducing bias and this kind of

3322
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:11,780
 

3323
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:13,369
 doubly robust intuition it turns out to

3324
01:05:11,770 --> 01:05:13,369
 

3325
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:14,960
 be very important when applying machine

3326
01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:14,960
 

3327
01:05:13,369 --> 01:05:16,940
 learning to causal inference because

3328
01:05:14,950 --> 01:05:16,940
 

3329
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:18,920
 generally we have these high dimensional

3330
01:05:16,930 --> 01:05:18,920
 

3331
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:20,750
 models and you do make a lot of mistakes

3332
01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:20,750
 

3333
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:22,640
 it's hard to estimate the treatment

3334
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:22,640
 

3335
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:24,500
 assignment policy it's hard to estimate

3336
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:24,500
 

3337
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:26,599
 the outcome model you can't control for

3338
01:05:24,490 --> 01:05:26,599
 

3339
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:30,770
 everything you have regularization and

3340
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:30,770
 

3341
01:05:26,599 --> 01:05:32,150
 duce biases and so combining the two

3342
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,150
 

3343
01:05:30,770 --> 01:05:34,579
 making being more robust makes you

3344
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:34,579
 

3345
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:36,440
 perform better okay so I'm gonna stop

3347
01:05:34,579 --> 01:05:41,150
 here and take a break and we'll come

3348
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:41,150
 

3349
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:49,849

3397
01:15:58,790 --> 01:16:04,230
 so I think people just filter in so

3398
01:16:01,610 --> 01:16:04,230
 

3399
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:06,450
 where I left off last time was talking

3400
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:06,450
 

3401
01:16:04,230 --> 01:16:08,280
 about this this kind of canonical

3402
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:08,280
 

3403
01:16:06,450 --> 01:16:10,650
 problem and I think it's like the really

3404
01:16:08,270 --> 01:16:10,650
 

3405
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:13,470
 the basic starting point of trying to

3406
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:13,470
 

3407
01:16:10,650 --> 01:16:15,090
 think about a causal inference outside

3408
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:15,090
 

3409
01:16:13,470 --> 01:16:16,620
 of the randomized experiment setting and

3410
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:16,620
 

3411
01:16:15,090 --> 01:16:20,900
 that's the setting with unconfoundedness

3412
01:16:16,610 --> 01:16:20,900
 

3413
01:16:16,620 --> 01:16:23,160
 and so the I would say the the final

3414
01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:23,160
 

3415
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:25,080
 recommendation out of this and I'm I

3416
01:16:23,150 --> 01:16:25,080
 

3417
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:28,170
 have some formal results and a series of

3418
01:16:25,070 --> 01:16:28,170
 

3419
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:31,440
 papers is that actually you can make

3420
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:31,440
 

3421
01:16:28,170 --> 01:16:35,100
 your optimal policy estimation or your

3422
01:16:31,430 --> 01:16:35,100
 

3423
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:38,070
 bandits work better if you use doubly

3424
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:38,070
 

3425
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:41,400
 robust estimation and so we have a paper

3426
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:41,400
 

3427
01:16:38,070 --> 01:16:44,700
 coming out in triple AI I guess in

3428
01:16:41,390 --> 01:16:44,700
 

3429
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:46,830
 January that illustrates this and

3430
01:16:44,690 --> 01:16:46,830
 

3431
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:49,770
 contextual bandits and then also I'll

3432
01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:49,770
 

3433
01:16:46,830 --> 01:16:51,870
 show you if I get time how that improves

3434
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:51,870
 

3435
01:16:49,770 --> 01:16:53,790
 the best known rates from the machine

3436
01:16:51,860 --> 01:16:53,790
 

3437
01:16:51,870 --> 01:16:56,580
 learning literature on estimating

3438
01:16:53,780 --> 01:16:56,580
 

3439
01:16:53,790 --> 01:16:59,190
 optimal policies and so and again this

3440
01:16:56,570 --> 01:16:59,190
 

3441
01:16:56,580 --> 01:17:01,710
 isn't doubly robust is not my idea it

3442
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:01,710
 

3443
01:16:59,190 --> 01:17:04,140
 goes back a very long time but I think

3444
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:04,140
 

3445
01:17:01,710 --> 01:17:06,090
 the reasons that it works really well in

3446
01:17:04,130 --> 01:17:06,090
 

3447
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:10,080
 machine learning settings in particular

3448
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:10,080
 

3449
01:17:06,090 --> 01:17:11,880
 is that we do we in high dimensional

3450
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:11,880
 

3451
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:14,640
 settings we're never get the models

3452
01:17:11,870 --> 01:17:14,640
 

3453
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:16,350
 right we we think that it's it's a

3454
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,350
 

3455
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:18,330
 really big problem that we don't get

3456
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:18,330
 

3457
01:17:16,350 --> 01:17:19,950
 models correct because we don't have

3458
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:19,950
 

3459
01:17:18,330 --> 01:17:21,780
 enough data to really estimate the

3460
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:21,780
 

3461
01:17:19,950 --> 01:17:24,360
 complete functions and so this

3462
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:24,360
 

3463
01:17:21,780 --> 01:17:26,520
 combination of outcome modelling where

3464
01:17:24,350 --> 01:17:26,520
 

3465
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:29,700
 the outcome modeling is basically trying

3466
01:17:26,510 --> 01:17:29,700
 

3467
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:33,240
 to adjust for the effect of confounders

3468
01:17:29,690 --> 01:17:33,240
 

3469
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:36,930
 on outcomes and REE waiting together can

3470
01:17:33,230 --> 01:17:36,930
 

3471
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:38,880
 work better so and let me just go back

3472
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:38,880
 

3473
01:17:36,930 --> 01:17:40,710
 cuz actually somebody was asking me in

3474
01:17:38,870 --> 01:17:40,710
 

3475
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:42,300
 the breaks that I went a little fast

3476
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:42,300
 

3477
01:17:40,710 --> 01:17:44,790
 here so I'm gonna use this notation

3478
01:17:42,290 --> 01:17:44,790
 

3479
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:47,970
 again so let me just say one more time

3480
01:17:44,780 --> 01:17:47,970
 

3481
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:50,220
 what all the objects are this outcomes

3482
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:50,220
 

3483
01:17:47,970 --> 01:17:52,050
 why I of one my I of zero those are the

3484
01:17:50,210 --> 01:17:52,050
 

3485
01:17:50,220 --> 01:17:54,390
 potential outcomes those are the

3486
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:54,390
 

3487
01:17:52,050 --> 01:17:56,130
 outcomes that you would have gotten why

3488
01:17:54,380 --> 01:17:56,130
 

3489
01:17:54,390 --> 01:17:58,500
 I have one is what you would have gotten

3490
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:58,500
 

3491
01:17:56,130 --> 01:17:59,670
 if you were treated why I have zero is

3492
01:17:58,490 --> 01:17:59,670
 

3493
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:02,250
 what you would have gotten if you were

3494
01:17:59,660 --> 01:18:02,250
 

3495
01:17:59,670 --> 01:18:04,380
 control if both of those were stamped on

3496
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:04,380
 

3497
01:18:02,250 --> 01:18:05,760
 your forehead then causal inference

3498
01:18:04,370 --> 01:18:05,760
 

3499
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:08,730
 would basically just look like a

3500
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:08,730
 

3501
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:09,909
 supervised learning problem the problem

3502
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:09,909
 

3503
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:12,039
 is there's a missing data

3504
01:18:09,899 --> 01:18:12,039
 

3505
01:18:09,909 --> 01:18:15,130
 problem that I only observed one or the

3506
01:18:12,029 --> 01:18:15,130
 

3507
01:18:12,039 --> 01:18:16,809
 other for any particular person and it's

3508
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:16,809
 

3509
01:18:15,130 --> 01:18:18,489
 not him of course if it was just missing

3510
01:18:16,799 --> 01:18:18,489
 

3511
01:18:16,809 --> 01:18:20,619
 at random like in a randomized

3512
01:18:18,479 --> 01:18:20,619
 

3513
01:18:18,489 --> 01:18:22,510
 experiment it's missing at random so

3514
01:18:20,609 --> 01:18:22,510
 

3515
01:18:20,619 --> 01:18:23,199
 having data missing at random is not a

3516
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:23,199
 

3517
01:18:22,510 --> 01:18:24,610
 problem

3518
01:18:23,189 --> 01:18:24,610
 

3519
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:26,979
 the problem is if the data is missing

3520
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:26,979
 

3521
01:18:24,610 --> 01:18:28,780
 not at random that is the people who

3522
01:18:26,969 --> 01:18:28,780
 

3523
01:18:26,979 --> 01:18:31,539
 drank coffee or took the drug look

3524
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:31,539
 

3525
01:18:28,780 --> 01:18:34,599
 different than the other people and the

3526
01:18:31,529 --> 01:18:34,599
 

3527
01:18:31,539 --> 01:18:37,209
 WI is the treatment xir the features and

3528
01:18:34,589 --> 01:18:37,209
 

3529
01:18:34,599 --> 01:18:40,269
 again the unconfoundedness assumption is

3530
01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:40,269
 

3531
01:18:37,209 --> 01:18:43,179
 that if you condition on all the x's

3532
01:18:40,259 --> 01:18:43,179
 

3533
01:18:40,269 --> 01:18:44,439
 these confounders then after

3534
01:18:43,169 --> 01:18:44,439
 

3535
01:18:43,179 --> 01:18:46,689
 conditioning on them the treatment

3536
01:18:44,429 --> 01:18:46,689
 

3537
01:18:44,439 --> 01:18:48,429
 assignment is as good as random and I

3538
01:18:46,679 --> 01:18:48,429
 

3539
01:18:46,689 --> 01:18:51,130
 should mention but one reason this this

3540
01:18:48,419 --> 01:18:51,130
 

3541
01:18:48,429 --> 01:18:54,249
 approach is sort of out of favor

3542
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:54,249
 

3543
01:18:51,130 --> 01:18:56,199
 somewhat in social sciences is that what

3544
01:18:54,239 --> 01:18:56,199
 

3545
01:18:54,249 --> 01:18:57,519
 we found over a period of many decades

3546
01:18:56,189 --> 01:18:57,519
 

3547
01:18:56,199 --> 01:18:59,679
 is that people would apply this

3548
01:18:57,509 --> 01:18:59,679
 

3549
01:18:57,519 --> 01:19:01,150
 observational data they would kind of

3550
01:18:59,669 --> 01:19:01,150
 

3551
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:03,669
 argue that they'd controlled for

3552
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:03,669
 

3553
01:19:01,150 --> 01:19:05,050
 everything but it was hard they didn't

3554
01:19:03,659 --> 01:19:05,050
 

3555
01:19:03,669 --> 01:19:06,729
 have enough data to really do it well

3556
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:06,729
 

3557
01:19:05,050 --> 01:19:08,349
 and so they got different answers

3558
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:08,349
 

3559
01:19:06,729 --> 01:19:09,939
 depending on which functional forms they

3560
01:19:08,339 --> 01:19:09,939
 

3561
01:19:08,349 --> 01:19:12,760
 chose and so there was sort of a

3562
01:19:09,929 --> 01:19:12,760
 

3563
01:19:09,939 --> 01:19:14,439
 methodology wore around this whereas you

3564
01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:14,439
 

3565
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:15,969
 know some people said matching some

3566
01:19:14,429 --> 01:19:15,969
 

3567
01:19:14,439 --> 01:19:18,249
 people said outcome modelling some

3568
01:19:15,959 --> 01:19:18,249
 

3569
01:19:15,969 --> 01:19:19,840
 people said propensity scores on any

3570
01:19:18,239 --> 01:19:19,840
 

3571
01:19:18,249 --> 01:19:21,550
 particular data set you could get

3572
01:19:19,830 --> 01:19:21,550
 

3573
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:23,590
 different answers from different methods

3574
01:19:21,540 --> 01:19:23,590
 

3575
01:19:21,550 --> 01:19:25,929
 so I think the beauty that machine

3576
01:19:23,580 --> 01:19:25,929
 

3577
01:19:23,590 --> 01:19:28,989
 learning brings to all of this is that

3578
01:19:25,919 --> 01:19:28,989
 

3579
01:19:25,929 --> 01:19:31,300
 it gives you a systematic way to choose

3580
01:19:28,979 --> 01:19:31,300
 

3581
01:19:28,989 --> 01:19:33,579
 functional forms and then also if you

3582
01:19:31,290 --> 01:19:33,579
 

3583
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:36,429
 adopt this sort of double robust type of

3584
01:19:33,569 --> 01:19:36,429
 

3585
01:19:33,579 --> 01:19:38,949
 approach it tells you you have many

3586
01:19:36,419 --> 01:19:38,949
 

3587
01:19:36,429 --> 01:19:41,919
 fewer decisions to make as a researcher

3588
01:19:38,939 --> 01:19:41,919
 

3589
01:19:38,949 --> 01:19:45,610
 and the using very flexible functional

3590
01:19:41,909 --> 01:19:45,610
 

3591
01:19:41,919 --> 01:19:47,709
 forms in a data-driven way to to to

3592
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,709
 

3593
01:19:45,610 --> 01:19:49,479
 select them with the correct objective

3594
01:19:47,699 --> 01:19:49,479
 

3595
01:19:47,709 --> 01:19:51,760
 function can really improve things and

3596
01:19:49,469 --> 01:19:51,760
 

3597
01:19:49,479 --> 01:19:53,619
 then finally as I mentioned I think in

3598
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:53,619
 

3599
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:55,389
 the modern digital world it's actually

3600
01:19:53,609 --> 01:19:55,389
 

3601
01:19:53,619 --> 01:19:56,969
 more plausible that we might have a data

3602
01:19:55,379 --> 01:19:56,969
 

3603
01:19:55,389 --> 01:19:59,289
 set where the assumptions are satisfied

3604
01:19:56,959 --> 01:19:59,289
 

3605
01:19:56,969 --> 01:20:00,699
 where in the past you know I might have

3606
01:19:59,279 --> 01:20:00,699
 

3607
01:19:59,289 --> 01:20:02,590
 done I might have said oh I'm gonna try

3608
01:20:00,689 --> 01:20:02,590
 

3609
01:20:00,699 --> 01:20:05,050
 to figure out the effect of you going to

3610
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:05,050
 

3611
01:20:02,590 --> 01:20:07,269
 college and if I just control for enough

3612
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:07,269
 

3613
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:10,900
 stuff you going to college is as good as

3614
01:20:07,259 --> 01:20:10,900
 

3615
01:20:07,269 --> 01:20:13,360
 random and you might say no it's not you

3616
01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:13,360
 

3617
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:15,039
 know you you two people who looked

3618
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:15,039
 

3619
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:16,539
 identical in terms of all the stuff I

3620
01:20:15,029 --> 01:20:16,539
 

3621
01:20:15,039 --> 01:20:18,699
 could observe in the census data one

3622
01:20:16,529 --> 01:20:18,699
 

3623
01:20:16,539 --> 01:20:20,260
 went to college and one didn't probably

3624
01:20:18,689 --> 01:20:20,260
 

3625
01:20:18,699 --> 01:20:22,179
 those people are different in some other

3626
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:22,179
 

3627
01:20:20,260 --> 01:20:23,659
 ways it's just not plausible that I've

3628
01:20:22,169 --> 01:20:23,659
 

3629
01:20:22,179 --> 01:20:25,900
 really controlled for everything

3630
01:20:23,649 --> 01:20:25,900
 

3631
01:20:23,659 --> 01:20:28,310
 if I did it for an application like that

3632
01:20:25,890 --> 01:20:28,310
 

3633
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:30,020
 or occupational choice or something it

3634
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:30,020
 

3635
01:20:28,310 --> 01:20:31,940
 just wouldn't be plausible but if I'm

3636
01:20:30,010 --> 01:20:31,940
 

3637
01:20:30,020 --> 01:20:33,620
 thinking of a setting where I'm

3638
01:20:31,930 --> 01:20:33,620
 

3639
01:20:31,940 --> 01:20:35,630
 interacting in a digital environment the

3640
01:20:33,610 --> 01:20:35,630
 

3641
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:37,670
 treatments are being assigned digitally

3642
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:37,670
 

3643
01:20:35,630 --> 01:20:39,440
 then the treatment if it's designed

3644
01:20:37,660 --> 01:20:39,440
 

3645
01:20:37,670 --> 01:20:41,090
 digitally then the exes must have been

3646
01:20:39,430 --> 01:20:41,090
 

3647
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:44,989
 observed in order to make the treatment

3648
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:44,989
 

3649
01:20:41,090 --> 01:20:47,449
 assignments work okay so if you let me

3650
01:20:44,979 --> 01:20:47,449
 

3651
01:20:44,989 --> 01:20:49,850
 just I'm doing to breeze through a few

3652
01:20:47,439 --> 01:20:49,850
 

3653
01:20:47,449 --> 01:20:51,380
 of the applications of machine learning

3654
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:51,380
 

3655
01:20:49,850 --> 01:20:54,409
 the way machine learning has come into

3656
01:20:51,370 --> 01:20:54,409
 

3657
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:58,400
 this area recently an early idea people

3658
01:20:54,399 --> 01:20:58,400
 

3659
01:20:54,409 --> 01:21:00,380
 had was to to use machine learning to

3660
01:20:58,390 --> 01:21:00,380
 

3661
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:01,880
 estimate propensity scores and again the

3662
01:21:00,370 --> 01:21:01,880
 

3663
01:21:00,380 --> 01:21:04,489
 propensity score just going back a

3664
01:21:01,870 --> 01:21:04,489
 

3665
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:05,840
 second the propensity score is the

3666
01:21:04,479 --> 01:21:05,840
 

3667
01:21:04,489 --> 01:21:08,630
 probability that you're treated

3668
01:21:05,830 --> 01:21:08,630
 

3669
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:10,100
 conditional on your exes so if you're if

3670
01:21:08,620 --> 01:21:10,100
 

3671
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:11,840
 your Epps's show that you're very sick

3672
01:21:10,090 --> 01:21:11,840
 

3673
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:12,350
 you might have a high propensity to get

3674
01:21:11,830 --> 01:21:12,350
 

3675
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:14,420
 the drug

3676
01:21:12,340 --> 01:21:14,420
 

3677
01:21:12,350 --> 01:21:15,920
 if the exes show that you're healthy you

3678
01:21:14,410 --> 01:21:15,920
 

3679
01:21:14,420 --> 01:21:17,630
 might have a low propensity to get the

3680
01:21:15,910 --> 01:21:17,630
 

3681
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:19,460
 drug so the propensity score is your

3682
01:21:17,620 --> 01:21:19,460
 

3683
01:21:17,630 --> 01:21:21,620
 propensity to be treated as a function

3684
01:21:19,450 --> 01:21:21,620
 

3685
01:21:19,460 --> 01:21:23,600
 of the covariance if you go to a lot of

3686
01:21:21,610 --> 01:21:23,600
 

3687
01:21:21,620 --> 01:21:29,150
 car websites you might be more likely to

3688
01:21:23,590 --> 01:21:29,150
 

3689
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:31,670
 see a car ad than if you don't and so

3690
01:21:29,140 --> 01:21:31,670
 

3691
01:21:29,150 --> 01:21:33,770
 this this early approach was to estimate

3692
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:33,770
 

3693
01:21:31,670 --> 01:21:36,010
 propensity scores and use those for

3694
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:36,010
 

3695
01:21:33,770 --> 01:21:38,480
 reweighed and I just gave one example

3696
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,480
 

3697
01:21:36,010 --> 01:21:40,100
 but there's actually even you know a

3698
01:21:38,470 --> 01:21:40,100
 

3699
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:41,719
 number of people in the machine learning

3700
01:21:40,090 --> 01:21:41,719
 

3701
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:43,429
 literature who have adopted propensity

3702
01:21:41,709 --> 01:21:43,429
 

3703
01:21:41,719 --> 01:21:44,989
 weighting in some form or another for

3704
01:21:43,419 --> 01:21:44,989
 

3705
01:21:43,429 --> 01:21:47,560
 example a group at Microsoft Research

3706
01:21:44,979 --> 01:21:47,560
 

3707
01:21:44,989 --> 01:21:50,090
 New York has done that a lot with the

3708
01:21:47,550 --> 01:21:50,090
 

3709
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:55,040
 contextual bandits John Lankford and

3710
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:55,040
 

3711
01:21:50,090 --> 01:21:56,870
 co-authors a second method is regression

3712
01:21:55,030 --> 01:21:56,870
 

3713
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:57,920
 adjustment so as I mentioned that was

3714
01:21:56,860 --> 01:21:57,920
 

3715
01:21:56,870 --> 01:21:59,780
 set to show in the picture kind of

3716
01:21:57,910 --> 01:21:59,780
 

3717
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:02,870
 drawing the line which you might want to

3718
01:21:59,770 --> 01:22:02,870
 

3719
01:21:59,780 --> 01:22:04,250
 do is try to just estimate how two X's

3720
01:22:02,860 --> 01:22:04,250
 

3721
01:22:02,870 --> 01:22:06,110
 affect outcomes how do your features

3722
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:06,110
 

3723
01:22:04,250 --> 01:22:07,880
 affect outcomes and if I can adjust for

3724
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:07,880
 

3725
01:22:06,110 --> 01:22:09,440
 that then I can adjust for the

3726
01:22:07,870 --> 01:22:09,440
 

3727
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:11,030
 differences between the treatment and

3728
01:22:09,430 --> 01:22:11,030
 

3729
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:15,050
 the control group and get a causal

3730
01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:15,050
 

3731
01:22:11,030 --> 01:22:17,780
 effect so one of the early economics

3732
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:17,780
 

3733
01:22:15,050 --> 01:22:18,889
 papers in this area I mentioned it here

3734
01:22:17,770 --> 01:22:18,889
 

3735
01:22:17,780 --> 01:22:21,500
 not but it's actually not the best

3736
01:22:18,879 --> 01:22:21,500
 

3737
01:22:18,889 --> 01:22:23,330
 method to use but because they make this

3738
01:22:21,490 --> 01:22:23,330
 

3739
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:25,250
 really nice point that it's very

3740
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:25,250
 

3741
01:22:23,330 --> 01:22:27,800
 different to do supervised learning than

3742
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:27,800
 

3743
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:30,560
 it is to do causal inference so in

3744
01:22:27,790 --> 01:22:30,560
 

3745
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:32,600
 particular they they what they suggest

3746
01:22:30,550 --> 01:22:32,600
 

3747
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:34,940
 that you do is you use the lasso

3748
01:22:32,590 --> 01:22:34,940
 

3749
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:37,550
 regression model to

3750
01:22:34,930 --> 01:22:37,550
 

3751
01:22:34,940 --> 01:22:39,290
 make two separate regressions the first

3752
01:22:37,540 --> 01:22:39,290
 

3753
01:22:37,550 --> 01:22:41,750
 regression is the regression of the

3754
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:41,750
 

3755
01:22:39,290 --> 01:22:43,400
 treatment assignment on the features so

3756
01:22:41,740 --> 01:22:43,400
 

3757
01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:45,199
 this is estimating the propensity model

3758
01:22:43,390 --> 01:22:45,199
 

3759
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:48,610
 this is looking at the data and saying

3760
01:22:45,189 --> 01:22:48,610
 

3761
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:51,800
 which X's predict who should be treated

3762
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:51,800
 

3763
01:22:48,610 --> 01:22:57,380
 then a second separate regression model

3764
01:22:51,790 --> 01:22:57,380
 

3765
01:22:51,800 --> 01:23:00,620
 which X's predict outcomes now then what

3766
01:22:57,370 --> 01:23:00,620
 

3767
01:22:57,380 --> 01:23:03,050
 they suggest is take all of the X's that

3768
01:23:00,610 --> 01:23:03,050
 

3769
01:23:00,620 --> 01:23:04,670
 were not zeroed out in either regression

3770
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,670
 

3771
01:23:03,050 --> 01:23:08,989
 so if you if you were selected in either

3772
01:23:04,660 --> 01:23:08,989
 

3773
01:23:04,670 --> 01:23:11,390
 one then keep them in and finally run a

3774
01:23:08,979 --> 01:23:11,390
 

3775
01:23:08,989 --> 01:23:14,270
 regression of the outcome on the

3776
01:23:11,380 --> 01:23:14,270
 

3777
01:23:11,390 --> 01:23:17,540
 treatment Y on W controlling for all

3778
01:23:14,260 --> 01:23:17,540
 

3779
01:23:14,270 --> 01:23:19,550
 these X's now if since Lazo is

3780
01:23:17,530 --> 01:23:19,550
 

3781
01:23:17,540 --> 01:23:20,840
 optimizing for goodness of fit we know

3782
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:20,840
 

3783
01:23:19,550 --> 01:23:22,370
 that you're going to be sacrificing

3784
01:23:20,830 --> 01:23:22,370
 

3785
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:24,710
 goodness of fit because if you do the

3786
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:24,710
 

3787
01:23:22,370 --> 01:23:27,920
 cross-validation correctly just the

3788
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:27,920
 

3789
01:23:24,710 --> 01:23:29,690
 regression of Y on X and you letting

3790
01:23:27,910 --> 01:23:29,690
 

3791
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:31,100
 last so tell you which X's predict Y

3792
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:31,100
 

3793
01:23:29,690 --> 01:23:33,320
 would be the best thing from the

3794
01:23:31,090 --> 01:23:33,320
 

3795
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:35,449
 perspective of goodness of fit so why

3796
01:23:33,310 --> 01:23:35,449
 

3797
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:37,969
 would you sacrifice goodness of fit to

3798
01:23:35,439 --> 01:23:37,969
 

3799
01:23:35,449 --> 01:23:40,190
 throw in these other X's that don't even

3800
01:23:37,959 --> 01:23:40,190
 

3801
01:23:37,969 --> 01:23:42,530
 explain outcome so strongly but X's that

3802
01:23:40,180 --> 01:23:42,530
 

3803
01:23:40,190 --> 01:23:44,060
 explain treatments well the answer is

3804
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:44,060
 

3805
01:23:42,530 --> 01:23:46,940
 that if you don't control for

3806
01:23:44,050 --> 01:23:46,940
 

3807
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:49,430
 confounders you'll be biased and you'll

3808
01:23:46,930 --> 01:23:49,430
 

3809
01:23:46,940 --> 01:23:51,680
 actually get the wrong answer so in the

3810
01:23:49,420 --> 01:23:51,680
 

3811
01:23:49,430 --> 01:23:54,800
 example of a drug there could be some

3812
01:23:51,670 --> 01:23:54,800
 

3813
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:57,920
 medical sign that is important for

3814
01:23:54,790 --> 01:23:57,920
 

3815
01:23:54,800 --> 01:24:00,170
 doctors and assigning the drug it's sort

3816
01:23:57,910 --> 01:24:00,170
 

3817
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:01,760
 of weakly predictive of outcomes but

3818
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:01,760
 

3819
01:24:00,170 --> 01:24:03,680
 it's important for getting the drug and

3820
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:03,680
 

3821
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:05,150
 it's indicative of being sick and there

3822
01:24:03,670 --> 01:24:05,150
 

3823
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:07,010
 might actually be a lot of weak

3824
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:07,010
 

3825
01:24:05,150 --> 01:24:08,570
 predictors and laso will zero out

3826
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,570
 

3827
01:24:07,010 --> 01:24:10,160
 we're predictors if they're weak enough

3828
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:10,160
 

3829
01:24:08,570 --> 01:24:12,050
 so you might have a lot of weak

3830
01:24:10,150 --> 01:24:12,050
 

3831
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:14,390
 predictors of being sick that are

3832
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:14,390
 

3833
01:24:12,050 --> 01:24:17,540
 important for signing the drug and in

3834
01:24:14,380 --> 01:24:17,540
 

3835
01:24:14,390 --> 01:24:20,630
 aggregate are also going to affect your

3836
01:24:17,530 --> 01:24:20,630
 

3837
01:24:17,540 --> 01:24:24,890
 how sick you are but if you just do a

3838
01:24:20,620 --> 01:24:24,890
 

3839
01:24:20,630 --> 01:24:27,380
 predictive model of Y on X you won't

3840
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:27,380
 

3841
01:24:24,890 --> 01:24:28,760
 pick those up and so the point is that

3842
01:24:27,370 --> 01:24:28,760
 

3843
01:24:27,380 --> 01:24:30,050
 for causal inference we're not just

3844
01:24:28,750 --> 01:24:30,050
 

3845
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:33,080
 concerned about the predictive power

3846
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:33,080
 

3847
01:24:30,050 --> 01:24:34,610
 we're concerned about bias we're control

3848
01:24:33,070 --> 01:24:34,610
 

3849
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:36,949
 we're worried that we might omit a

3850
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:36,949
 

3851
01:24:34,610 --> 01:24:38,840
 variable that is a confounder

3852
01:24:36,939 --> 01:24:38,840
 

3853
01:24:36,949 --> 01:24:40,520
 we're worried we might omit a variable

3854
01:24:38,830 --> 01:24:40,520
 

3855
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:43,190
 that relates to both your treatment

3856
01:24:40,510 --> 01:24:43,190
 

3857
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:46,310
 assignment and your outcomes and that

3858
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:46,310
 

3859
01:24:43,190 --> 01:24:48,329
 you would confound the causal effect so

3860
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:48,329
 

3861
01:24:46,310 --> 01:24:50,639
 this is a nice little

3862
01:24:48,319 --> 01:24:50,639
 

3863
01:24:48,329 --> 01:24:52,559
 kind of very easy to explain an example

3864
01:24:50,629 --> 01:24:52,559
 

3865
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:55,349
 that's a contrast between off-the-shelf

3866
01:24:52,549 --> 01:24:55,349
 

3867
01:24:52,559 --> 01:24:57,809
 supervised machine learning and causal

3868
01:24:55,339 --> 01:24:57,809
 

3869
01:24:55,349 --> 01:24:59,250
 inference and and it's really because

3870
01:24:57,799 --> 01:24:59,250
 

3871
01:24:57,809 --> 01:25:00,780
 our goal is different and you can think

3872
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:00,780
 

3873
01:24:59,250 --> 01:25:02,070
 about this as changing the objective

3874
01:25:00,770 --> 01:25:02,070
 

3875
01:25:00,780 --> 01:25:03,659
 function now this is not the

3876
01:25:02,060 --> 01:25:03,659
 

3877
01:25:02,070 --> 01:25:06,449
 highest-performing method method but

3878
01:25:03,649 --> 01:25:06,449
 

3879
01:25:03,659 --> 01:25:08,159
 it's just it's just a simple example so

3880
01:25:06,439 --> 01:25:08,159
 

3881
01:25:06,449 --> 01:25:10,199
 another method that's been fairly

3882
01:25:08,149 --> 01:25:10,199
 

3883
01:25:08,159 --> 01:25:12,030
 popular is to try to estimate the

3884
01:25:10,189 --> 01:25:12,030
 

3885
01:25:10,199 --> 01:25:14,369
 conditional average treatment effect and

3886
01:25:12,020 --> 01:25:14,369
 

3887
01:25:12,030 --> 01:25:15,869
 then average over the exes and so

3888
01:25:14,359 --> 01:25:15,869
 

3889
01:25:14,369 --> 01:25:17,610
 there's a there's a community Jennifer

3890
01:25:15,859 --> 01:25:17,610
 

3891
01:25:15,869 --> 01:25:20,070
 he'll be having one of the early papers

3892
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:20,070
 

3893
01:25:17,610 --> 01:25:22,050
 here using Bart and that has been very

3894
01:25:20,060 --> 01:25:22,050
 

3895
01:25:20,070 --> 01:25:24,179
 successful in a bunch of that we have

3896
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:24,179
 

3897
01:25:22,050 --> 01:25:25,800
 these causal inference competitions at

3898
01:25:24,169 --> 01:25:25,800
 

3899
01:25:24,179 --> 01:25:28,409
 this Atlantic causal inference

3900
01:25:25,790 --> 01:25:28,409
 

3901
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:29,790
 conference and the the BART based

3902
01:25:28,399 --> 01:25:29,790
 

3903
01:25:28,409 --> 01:25:32,250
 methods have actually done really well

3904
01:25:29,780 --> 01:25:32,250
 

3905
01:25:29,790 --> 01:25:34,230
 and a bunch of competitions especially

3906
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:34,230
 

3907
01:25:32,250 --> 01:25:36,960
 in certain settings with signal-to-noise

3908
01:25:34,220 --> 01:25:36,960
 

3909
01:25:34,230 --> 01:25:40,679
 ratio being in a certain range and so

3910
01:25:36,950 --> 01:25:40,679
 

3911
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:43,349
 what she does is she's going to use Bart

3912
01:25:40,669 --> 01:25:43,349
 

3913
01:25:40,679 --> 01:25:45,119
 to estimate the outcome model and we're

3914
01:25:43,339 --> 01:25:45,119
 

3915
01:25:43,349 --> 01:25:47,040
 going to think about estimating the

3916
01:25:45,109 --> 01:25:47,040
 

3917
01:25:45,119 --> 01:25:49,230
 expected value of the outcome

3918
01:25:47,030 --> 01:25:49,230
 

3919
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:51,329
 conditional on your covariance as well

3920
01:25:49,220 --> 01:25:51,329
 

3921
01:25:49,230 --> 01:25:53,790
 as conditional on the treatment and if I

3922
01:25:51,319 --> 01:25:53,790
 

3923
01:25:51,329 --> 01:25:57,210
 can estimate that that out that

3924
01:25:53,780 --> 01:25:57,210
 

3925
01:25:53,790 --> 01:25:59,639
 conditional mean function then I can

3926
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:59,639
 

3927
01:25:57,210 --> 01:26:03,119
 estimate just take the difference

3928
01:25:59,629 --> 01:26:03,119
 

3929
01:25:59,639 --> 01:26:04,440
 between what that function would be when

3930
01:26:03,109 --> 01:26:04,440
 

3931
01:26:03,119 --> 01:26:06,090
 you're treated and what that function

3932
01:26:04,430 --> 01:26:06,090
 

3933
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:07,800
 says you would be if you're not treated

3934
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:07,800
 

3935
01:26:06,090 --> 01:26:10,099
 interpret that as a causal model and

3936
01:26:07,790 --> 01:26:10,099
 

3937
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:12,420
 estimate the average treatment effect as

3938
01:26:10,089 --> 01:26:12,420
 

3939
01:26:10,099 --> 01:26:14,010
 getting the difference so this would be

3940
01:26:12,410 --> 01:26:14,010
 

3941
01:26:12,420 --> 01:26:16,469
 an example off-the-shelf of outcome

3942
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,469
 

3943
01:26:14,010 --> 01:26:18,210
 modeling now in extensions people have

3944
01:26:16,459 --> 01:26:18,210
 

3945
01:26:16,469 --> 01:26:22,260
 tried to bring in propensity weighting

3946
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:22,260
 

3947
01:26:18,210 --> 01:26:26,270
 into the BART and so on as well so the

3948
01:26:22,250 --> 01:26:26,270
 

3949
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:28,739
 way that they that I would recommend

3950
01:26:26,260 --> 01:26:28,739
 

3951
01:26:26,270 --> 01:26:31,320
 based on the statistical literature is

3952
01:26:28,729 --> 01:26:31,320
 

3953
01:26:28,739 --> 01:26:34,500
 double robust or double machine learning

3954
01:26:31,310 --> 01:26:34,500
 

3955
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:37,079
 methods and so what this is going to do

3956
01:26:34,490 --> 01:26:37,079
 

3957
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:39,210
 is take what's what's called an

3958
01:26:37,069 --> 01:26:39,210
 

3959
01:26:37,079 --> 01:26:42,210
 efficient score from this literature on

3960
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:42,210
 

3961
01:26:39,210 --> 01:26:45,480
 statistics and this is going to be

3962
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:45,480
 

3963
01:26:42,210 --> 01:26:47,460
 related to kind of a theory about how do

3964
01:26:45,470 --> 01:26:47,460
 

3965
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:50,250
 you efficiently estimate a parameter and

3966
01:26:47,450 --> 01:26:50,250
 

3967
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:52,980
 so in particular in the case of the

3968
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:52,980
 

3969
01:26:50,250 --> 01:26:54,179
 unconfoundedness this is what the the

3970
01:26:52,970 --> 01:26:54,179
 

3971
01:26:52,980 --> 01:26:57,389
 scores look like and there's different

3972
01:26:54,169 --> 01:26:57,389
 

3973
01:26:54,179 --> 01:26:59,619
 ways to write the scores so I'm gonna

3974
01:26:57,379 --> 01:26:59,619
 

3975
01:26:57,389 --> 01:27:02,320
 for every observation I

3976
01:26:59,609 --> 01:27:02,320
 

3977
01:26:59,619 --> 01:27:04,090
 gonna first figure out an estimator of

3978
01:27:02,310 --> 01:27:04,090
 

3979
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:05,709
 the treatment effect I'm just gonna try

3980
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:05,709
 

3981
01:27:04,090 --> 01:27:07,300
 to estimate a treatment effect model a

3982
01:27:05,699 --> 01:27:07,300
 

3983
01:27:05,709 --> 01:27:08,800
 conditional average treatment effect so

3984
01:27:07,290 --> 01:27:08,800
 

3985
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:10,570
 I'm gonna try to figure out what is the

3986
01:27:08,790 --> 01:27:10,570
 

3987
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:12,760
 the average treatment effect as a

3988
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:12,760
 

3989
01:27:10,570 --> 01:27:14,439
 function of your X's and I haven't told

3990
01:27:12,750 --> 01:27:14,439
 

3991
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:16,899
 you yet how we do that I'll come to that

3992
01:27:14,429 --> 01:27:16,899
 

3993
01:27:14,439 --> 01:27:19,090
 a little bit later there's a variety of

3994
01:27:16,889 --> 01:27:19,090
 

3995
01:27:16,899 --> 01:27:21,309
 different techniques I've been very into

3996
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:21,309
 

3997
01:27:19,090 --> 01:27:24,099
 random forests and so I would recommend

3998
01:27:21,299 --> 01:27:24,099
 

3999
01:27:21,309 --> 01:27:27,010
 you can use my generalized random forest

4000
01:27:24,089 --> 01:27:27,010
 

4001
01:27:24,099 --> 01:27:28,780
 package which is available in our but

4002
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,780
 

4003
01:27:27,010 --> 01:27:32,320
 there you can use lots of other methods

4004
01:27:28,770 --> 01:27:32,320
 

4005
01:27:28,780 --> 01:27:34,149
 for that as well so for you you can make

4006
01:27:32,310 --> 01:27:34,149
 

4007
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:36,399
 for every observation you basically have

4008
01:27:34,139 --> 01:27:36,399
 

4009
01:27:34,149 --> 01:27:38,349
 a baseline estimate of the treatment

4010
01:27:36,389 --> 01:27:38,349
 

4011
01:27:36,399 --> 01:27:40,840
 effect for that observation and then I'm

4012
01:27:38,339 --> 01:27:40,840
 

4013
01:27:38,349 --> 01:27:42,669
 going to adjust that treatment effect

4014
01:27:40,830 --> 01:27:42,669
 

4015
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:44,199
 and there's this kind of complicated

4016
01:27:42,659 --> 01:27:44,199
 

4017
01:27:42,669 --> 01:27:46,149
 algebra but let me just say it in words

4018
01:27:44,189 --> 01:27:46,149
 

4019
01:27:44,199 --> 01:27:48,309
 because the algebra is a little bit hard

4020
01:27:46,139 --> 01:27:48,309
 

4021
01:27:46,149 --> 01:27:50,409
 to read there's this term which is

4022
01:27:48,299 --> 01:27:50,409
 

4023
01:27:48,309 --> 01:27:54,399
 basically the residual of a regression

4024
01:27:50,399 --> 01:27:54,399
 

4025
01:27:50,409 --> 01:27:56,979
 of Y on X and W so I'm gonna I'm gonna

4026
01:27:54,389 --> 01:27:56,979
 

4027
01:27:54,399 --> 01:27:58,300
 also separately build an outcome model

4028
01:27:56,969 --> 01:27:58,300
 

4029
01:27:56,979 --> 01:28:01,209
 mew hat which is going to be the

4030
01:27:58,290 --> 01:28:01,209
 

4031
01:27:58,300 --> 01:28:03,249
 conditional mean of the outcome

4032
01:28:01,199 --> 01:28:03,249
 

4033
01:28:01,209 --> 01:28:06,969
 conditional on the features and the

4034
01:28:03,239 --> 01:28:06,969
 

4035
01:28:03,249 --> 01:28:09,429
 treatment and so then if it turns out

4036
01:28:06,959 --> 01:28:09,429
 

4037
01:28:06,969 --> 01:28:12,639
 that this observation was a treated

4038
01:28:09,419 --> 01:28:12,639
 

4039
01:28:09,429 --> 01:28:14,800
 observation I'm gonna weight it by the

4040
01:28:12,629 --> 01:28:14,800
 

4041
01:28:12,639 --> 01:28:15,849
 probability of it being treated and if

4042
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:15,849
 

4043
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:17,619
 it turns out it was a control

4044
01:28:15,839 --> 01:28:17,619
 

4045
01:28:15,849 --> 01:28:19,539
 observation I'm gonna weight it by the

4046
01:28:17,609 --> 01:28:19,539
 

4047
01:28:17,619 --> 01:28:24,099
 probability of being control and that's

4048
01:28:19,529 --> 01:28:24,099
 

4049
01:28:19,539 --> 01:28:27,909
 all that that middle expression says so

4050
01:28:24,089 --> 01:28:27,909
 

4051
01:28:24,099 --> 01:28:30,159
 so basically what this score is doing is

4052
01:28:27,899 --> 01:28:30,159
 

4053
01:28:27,909 --> 01:28:32,829
 it's it's sort of orthogonal izing

4054
01:28:30,149 --> 01:28:32,829
 

4055
01:28:30,159 --> 01:28:35,469
 things it's it's taking a residual and

4056
01:28:32,819 --> 01:28:35,469
 

4057
01:28:32,829 --> 01:28:36,849
 this moment mistakes I make in

4058
01:28:35,459 --> 01:28:36,849
 

4059
01:28:35,469 --> 01:28:40,030
 estimating these nuisance parameters

4060
01:28:36,839 --> 01:28:40,030
 

4061
01:28:36,849 --> 01:28:42,309
 like the mule had which is not the main

4062
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:42,309
 

4063
01:28:40,030 --> 01:28:43,929
 object of interest or orthogonal to the

4064
01:28:42,299 --> 01:28:43,929
 

4065
01:28:42,309 --> 01:28:46,179
 moment and that's what that's gonna mean

4066
01:28:43,919 --> 01:28:46,179
 

4067
01:28:43,929 --> 01:28:47,889
 is that mistakes did I make if I get you

4068
01:28:46,169 --> 01:28:47,889
 

4069
01:28:46,179 --> 01:28:49,929
 had a little bit wrong it's not gonna

4070
01:28:47,879 --> 01:28:49,929
 

4071
01:28:47,889 --> 01:28:52,389
 bias my estimate of the treatment effect

4072
01:28:49,919 --> 01:28:52,389
 

4073
01:28:49,929 --> 01:28:54,369
 so this this statistical theory it's

4074
01:28:52,379 --> 01:28:54,369
 

4075
01:28:52,389 --> 01:28:56,769
 complicated so I'm not gonna be able to

4076
01:28:54,359 --> 01:28:56,769
 

4077
01:28:54,369 --> 01:28:58,659
 do it full justice so I just really want

4078
01:28:56,759 --> 01:28:58,659
 

4079
01:28:56,769 --> 01:29:01,059
 you to kind of take the idea that for

4080
01:28:58,649 --> 01:29:01,059
 

4081
01:28:58,659 --> 01:29:03,550
 every every problem that you look at you

4082
01:29:01,049 --> 01:29:03,550
 

4083
01:29:01,059 --> 01:29:06,189
 can do a bunch of algebra and come up

4084
01:29:03,540 --> 01:29:06,189
 

4085
01:29:03,550 --> 01:29:07,659
 with a set of moments that you can use

4086
01:29:06,179 --> 01:29:07,659
 

4087
01:29:06,189 --> 01:29:10,140
 to estimate the parameter and they're

4088
01:29:07,649 --> 01:29:10,140
 

4089
01:29:07,659 --> 01:29:11,730
 called orthogonal moments when the

4090
01:29:10,130 --> 01:29:11,730
 

4091
01:29:10,140 --> 01:29:12,990
 with parameters that aren't your

4092
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:12,990
 

4093
01:29:11,730 --> 01:29:15,000
 parameter of interests like I'm not

4094
01:29:12,980 --> 01:29:15,000
 

4095
01:29:12,990 --> 01:29:17,400
 intrinsically interested in estimating

4096
01:29:14,990 --> 01:29:17,400
 

4097
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:19,710
 the outcomes are orthogonal to your

4098
01:29:17,390 --> 01:29:19,710
 

4099
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:21,570
 moment and in particular here that's

4100
01:29:19,700 --> 01:29:21,570
 

4101
01:29:19,710 --> 01:29:23,610
 also it you could say it's doubly robust

4102
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:23,610
 

4103
01:29:21,570 --> 01:29:25,260
 as I said before if you get either the

4104
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:25,260
 

4105
01:29:23,610 --> 01:29:26,700
 outcome model wrong or the propensity

4106
01:29:25,250 --> 01:29:26,700
 

4107
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:29,370
 model wrong you'll still get the right

4108
01:29:26,690 --> 01:29:29,370
 

4109
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:31,140
 answer and so in particular if I if I

4110
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:31,140
 

4111
01:29:29,370 --> 01:29:32,940
 use this approach I'm gonna get routing

4112
01:29:31,130 --> 01:29:32,940
 

4113
01:29:31,140 --> 01:29:35,760
 convergence even if the nuisance

4114
01:29:32,930 --> 01:29:35,760
 

4115
01:29:32,940 --> 01:29:37,710
 parameters converge more slowly say it

4116
01:29:35,750 --> 01:29:37,710
 

4117
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:40,170
 rate into the fourth which helps in high

4118
01:29:37,700 --> 01:29:40,170
 

4119
01:29:37,710 --> 01:29:42,240
 dimensions so another thing that we're

4120
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:42,240
 

4121
01:29:40,170 --> 01:29:43,920
 gonna do here which is not standard in

4122
01:29:42,230 --> 01:29:43,920
 

4123
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:45,690
 machine learning well although it might

4124
01:29:43,910 --> 01:29:45,690
 

4125
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:48,810
 be if you're using random forests but

4126
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:48,810
 

4127
01:29:45,690 --> 01:29:50,850
 isn't isn't always used is that we're

4128
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:50,850
 

4129
01:29:48,810 --> 01:29:52,590
 going to use either out of bag estimates

4130
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:52,590
 

4131
01:29:50,850 --> 01:29:54,420
 of the nuisance parameters or we're

4132
01:29:52,580 --> 01:29:54,420
 

4133
01:29:52,590 --> 01:29:56,400
 gonna use cross fitting so if we were

4134
01:29:54,410 --> 01:29:56,400
 

4135
01:29:54,420 --> 01:29:59,340
 doing a neural network we might break

4136
01:29:56,390 --> 01:29:59,340
 

4137
01:29:56,400 --> 01:30:02,070
 the data into ten folds and for each

4138
01:29:59,330 --> 01:30:02,070
 

4139
01:29:59,340 --> 01:30:04,980
 observation I'm gonna estimate their

4140
01:30:02,060 --> 01:30:04,980
 

4141
01:30:02,070 --> 01:30:07,320
 nuisance parameters using the data other

4142
01:30:04,970 --> 01:30:07,320
 

4143
01:30:04,980 --> 01:30:09,450
 than that observation and what that's

4144
01:30:07,310 --> 01:30:09,450
 

4145
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:11,100
 going to mean is that if if one

4146
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:11,100
 

4147
01:30:09,450 --> 01:30:15,060
 particular observation is an outlier

4148
01:30:11,090 --> 01:30:15,060
 

4149
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:18,480
 that observation might might then draw

4150
01:30:15,050 --> 01:30:18,480
 

4151
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:21,600
 up say the outcome model and that would

4152
01:30:18,470 --> 01:30:21,600
 

4153
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:26,280
 create a correlation between my the

4154
01:30:21,590 --> 01:30:26,280
 

4155
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:28,740
 outcome and the mistakes in this in

4156
01:30:26,270 --> 01:30:28,740
 

4157
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:31,380
 these outcome models in the Mew hat

4158
01:30:28,730 --> 01:30:31,380
 

4159
01:30:28,740 --> 01:30:33,780
 functions and so by using cross fitting

4160
01:30:31,370 --> 01:30:33,780
 

4161
01:30:31,380 --> 01:30:35,730
 I make myself much more robust and

4162
01:30:33,770 --> 01:30:35,730
 

4163
01:30:33,780 --> 01:30:37,950
 that's actually important for the

4164
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:37,950
 

4165
01:30:35,730 --> 01:30:40,140
 statistical theory here and so what we

4166
01:30:37,940 --> 01:30:40,140
 

4167
01:30:37,950 --> 01:30:42,120
 found in in applications is that that

4168
01:30:40,130 --> 01:30:42,120
 

4169
01:30:40,140 --> 01:30:43,980
 using cross fitting or using out of bag

4170
01:30:42,110 --> 01:30:43,980
 

4171
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:46,530
 for the random forests actually really

4172
01:30:43,970 --> 01:30:46,530
 

4173
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:48,690
 does improve the performance of these of

4174
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:48,690
 

4175
01:30:46,530 --> 01:30:50,760
 these models and I'll talk a little

4176
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:50,760
 

4177
01:30:48,690 --> 01:30:52,800
 later about another example of what

4178
01:30:50,750 --> 01:30:52,800
 

4179
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:54,210
 would have a deep neural net implication

4180
01:30:52,790 --> 01:30:54,210
 

4181
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:56,460
 of instrumental variables where they

4182
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:56,460
 

4183
01:30:54,210 --> 01:30:58,320
 also found that various types of

4184
01:30:56,450 --> 01:30:58,320
 

4185
01:30:56,460 --> 01:31:03,030
 orthogonal izing made a big difference

4186
01:30:58,310 --> 01:31:03,030
 

4187
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:05,490
 in performance a final method that that

4188
01:31:03,020 --> 01:31:05,490
 

4189
01:31:03,030 --> 01:31:06,720
 I worked on is actually gets rid of the

4190
01:31:05,480 --> 01:31:06,720
 

4191
01:31:05,490 --> 01:31:08,610
 assumption that you can even estimate

4192
01:31:06,710 --> 01:31:08,610
 

4193
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:10,470
 the treatment assignment model

4194
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:10,470
 

4195
01:31:08,610 --> 01:31:13,650
 so suppose facebook is using you know

4196
01:31:10,460 --> 01:31:13,650
 

4197
01:31:10,470 --> 01:31:15,240
 3000 features to decide whether you see

4198
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:15,240
 

4199
01:31:13,650 --> 01:31:18,150
 an ad or what goes in your newsfeed and

4200
01:31:15,230 --> 01:31:18,150
 

4201
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:19,650
 suppose in my advertisers experiment I

4202
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:19,650
 

4203
01:31:18,150 --> 01:31:22,560
 don't have enough data to really

4204
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:22,560
 

4205
01:31:19,650 --> 01:31:23,429
 estimate that function well so we use a

4206
01:31:22,550 --> 01:31:23,429
 

4207
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:25,949
 programming up

4208
01:31:23,419 --> 01:31:25,949
 

4209
01:31:23,429 --> 01:31:27,719
 approach to avoid actually estimating a

4210
01:31:25,939 --> 01:31:27,719
 

4211
01:31:25,949 --> 01:31:29,280
 propensity model but the programming

4212
01:31:27,709 --> 01:31:29,280
 

4213
01:31:27,719 --> 01:31:32,360
 approach just directly tries to estimate

4214
01:31:29,270 --> 01:31:32,360
 

4215
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:35,429
 weights and still gets double robustness

4216
01:31:32,350 --> 01:31:35,429
 

4217
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:37,559
 so I'm gonna skip that math in the

4218
01:31:35,419 --> 01:31:37,559
 

4219
01:31:35,429 --> 01:31:40,019
 interest of time now I want to talk

4220
01:31:37,549 --> 01:31:40,019
 

4221
01:31:37,559 --> 01:31:41,130
 about instrumental variables and this is

4222
01:31:40,009 --> 01:31:41,130
 

4223
01:31:40,019 --> 01:31:43,229
 something that you can use with

4224
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:43,229
 

4225
01:31:41,130 --> 01:31:44,699
 unconfoundedness fails and I would say

4226
01:31:43,219 --> 01:31:44,699
 

4227
01:31:43,229 --> 01:31:46,829
 this is actually a much more popular

4228
01:31:44,689 --> 01:31:46,829
 

4229
01:31:44,699 --> 01:31:48,570
 method in the social sciences now a

4230
01:31:46,819 --> 01:31:48,570
 

4231
01:31:46,829 --> 01:31:51,689
 couple years ago I gave a talk about

4232
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:51,689
 

4233
01:31:48,570 --> 01:31:53,429
 this at ktd back in Australia and at

4234
01:31:51,679 --> 01:31:53,429
 

4235
01:31:51,689 --> 01:31:54,929
 that time I asked how many people knew

4236
01:31:53,419 --> 01:31:54,929
 

4237
01:31:53,429 --> 01:31:57,780
 about instrumental variables and almost

4238
01:31:54,919 --> 01:31:57,780
 

4239
01:31:54,929 --> 01:31:59,219
 nobody did so maybe people have been

4240
01:31:57,770 --> 01:31:59,219
 

4241
01:31:57,780 --> 01:32:00,479
 exposed in the meantime so let me ask

4242
01:31:59,209 --> 01:32:00,479
 

4243
01:31:59,219 --> 01:32:03,570
 again how many people know about

4244
01:32:00,469 --> 01:32:03,570
 

4245
01:32:00,479 --> 01:32:08,400
 instrumental variables alright woohoo

4246
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:08,400
 

4247
01:32:03,570 --> 01:32:09,989
 there we go diffusion of ideas so so I'm

4248
01:32:08,390 --> 01:32:09,989
 

4249
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:11,249
 gonna go over them I still go over them

4250
01:32:09,979 --> 01:32:11,249
 

4251
01:32:09,989 --> 01:32:13,079
 from the beginning but then again I'm

4252
01:32:11,239 --> 01:32:13,079
 

4253
01:32:11,249 --> 01:32:16,409
 gonna try to talk about more recent

4254
01:32:13,069 --> 01:32:16,409
 

4255
01:32:13,079 --> 01:32:17,939
 research around these ideas so the idea

4256
01:32:16,399 --> 01:32:17,939
 

4257
01:32:16,409 --> 01:32:19,949
 of an instrumental variable is it's a

4258
01:32:17,929 --> 01:32:19,949
 

4259
01:32:17,939 --> 01:32:21,389
 variable that is correlated with your

4260
01:32:19,939 --> 01:32:21,389
 

4261
01:32:19,949 --> 01:32:25,590
 treatment assignment that means it's

4262
01:32:21,379 --> 01:32:25,590
 

4263
01:32:21,389 --> 01:32:28,409
 relevant but it's it's it's independent

4264
01:32:25,580 --> 01:32:28,409
 

4265
01:32:25,590 --> 01:32:30,179
 of the potential outcomes and so some

4266
01:32:28,399 --> 01:32:30,179
 

4267
01:32:28,409 --> 01:32:31,709
 examples of this if your treatment is

4268
01:32:30,169 --> 01:32:31,709
 

4269
01:32:30,179 --> 01:32:33,479
 military service suppose I want to know

4270
01:32:31,699 --> 01:32:33,479
 

4271
01:32:31,709 --> 01:32:35,670
 what's the effect of putting someone in

4272
01:32:33,469 --> 01:32:35,670
 

4273
01:32:33,479 --> 01:32:37,110
 the Army well people who go to the Army

4274
01:32:35,660 --> 01:32:37,110
 

4275
01:32:35,670 --> 01:32:38,760
 are different from people who don't go

4276
01:32:37,100 --> 01:32:38,760
 

4277
01:32:37,110 --> 01:32:40,769
 to the army so I can't just directly

4278
01:32:38,750 --> 01:32:40,769
 

4279
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:43,320
 compare them but when we had the

4280
01:32:40,759 --> 01:32:43,320
 

4281
01:32:40,769 --> 01:32:44,880
 military drafted for the Vietnam War we

4282
01:32:43,310 --> 01:32:44,880
 

4283
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:47,459
 could say that people with high lottery

4284
01:32:44,870 --> 01:32:47,459
 

4285
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:49,499
 numbers were more likely to go to the

4286
01:32:47,449 --> 01:32:49,499
 

4287
01:32:47,459 --> 01:32:51,239
 war than people with low lottery numbers

4288
01:32:49,489 --> 01:32:51,239
 

4289
01:32:49,499 --> 01:32:54,150
 and so the lottery number was randomly

4290
01:32:51,229 --> 01:32:54,150
 

4291
01:32:51,239 --> 01:32:56,459
 assigned now rich people or people that

4292
01:32:54,140 --> 01:32:56,459
 

4293
01:32:54,150 --> 01:32:58,229
 had soaring khals or heels or things

4294
01:32:56,449 --> 01:32:58,229
 

4295
01:32:56,459 --> 01:33:00,689
 like that that had a lottery number

4296
01:32:58,219 --> 01:33:00,689
 

4297
01:32:58,229 --> 01:33:02,579
 still didn't go to war so the instrument

4298
01:33:00,679 --> 01:33:02,579
 

4299
01:33:00,689 --> 01:33:05,939
 didn't completely determine who goes to

4300
01:33:02,569 --> 01:33:05,939
 

4301
01:33:02,579 --> 01:33:07,439
 war it just made you more likely to to

4302
01:33:05,929 --> 01:33:07,439
 

4303
01:33:05,939 --> 01:33:09,840
 go to war if you had a high draft

4304
01:33:07,429 --> 01:33:09,840
 

4305
01:33:07,439 --> 01:33:11,969
 lottery number there's a bunch of other

4306
01:33:09,830 --> 01:33:11,969
 

4307
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:13,949
 examples of this so in another one of my

4308
01:33:11,959 --> 01:33:13,949
 

4309
01:33:11,969 --> 01:33:16,199
 papers on random forests we use the

4310
01:33:13,939 --> 01:33:16,199
 

4311
01:33:13,949 --> 01:33:18,929
 example from a famous economics paper

4312
01:33:16,189 --> 01:33:18,929
 

4313
01:33:16,199 --> 01:33:20,639
 about the impact of having multiple

4314
01:33:18,919 --> 01:33:20,639
 

4315
01:33:18,929 --> 01:33:21,360
 children on women's labor force

4316
01:33:20,629 --> 01:33:21,360
 

4317
01:33:20,639 --> 01:33:23,880
 participation

4318
01:33:21,350 --> 01:33:23,880
 

4319
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:25,499
 now you're gonna think wow I can't do a

4320
01:33:23,870 --> 01:33:25,499
 

4321
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:28,260
 randomized experiment where I plopped

4322
01:33:25,489 --> 01:33:28,260
 

4323
01:33:25,499 --> 01:33:30,510
 down babies on women this is gonna be

4324
01:33:28,250 --> 01:33:30,510
 

4325
01:33:28,260 --> 01:33:32,969
 pretty hard to understand but it turns

4326
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:32,969
 

4327
01:33:30,510 --> 01:33:35,189
 out that if your first two children are

4328
01:33:32,959 --> 01:33:35,189
 

4329
01:33:32,969 --> 01:33:36,580
 the same sex that actually increases

4330
01:33:35,179 --> 01:33:36,580
 

4331
01:33:35,189 --> 01:33:40,480
 your odds of having a

4332
01:33:36,570 --> 01:33:40,480
 

4333
01:33:36,580 --> 01:33:42,190
 child and so that and so the having two

4334
01:33:40,470 --> 01:33:42,190
 

4335
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:44,070
 children the same sex is randomly

4336
01:33:42,180 --> 01:33:44,070
 

4337
01:33:42,190 --> 01:33:47,290
 assigned at least before we start

4338
01:33:44,060 --> 01:33:47,290
 

4339
01:33:44,070 --> 01:33:49,960
 genetically screening our babies and so

4340
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:49,960
 

4341
01:33:47,290 --> 01:33:51,910
 we can think about we can think about

4342
01:33:49,950 --> 01:33:51,910
 

4343
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:55,540
 that as something that's orthogonal to

4344
01:33:51,900 --> 01:33:55,540
 

4345
01:33:51,910 --> 01:33:57,490
 your labor market outcomes things like

4346
01:33:55,530 --> 01:33:57,490
 

4347
01:33:55,540 --> 01:33:59,260
 your quarter of birth determine how many

4348
01:33:57,480 --> 01:33:59,260
 

4349
01:33:57,490 --> 01:34:01,000
 years of education you get because if

4350
01:33:59,250 --> 01:34:01,000
 

4351
01:33:59,260 --> 01:34:02,440
 you're born right after a cutoff order

4352
01:34:00,990 --> 01:34:02,440
 

4353
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:04,180
 right before a cutoff that changes how

4354
01:34:02,430 --> 01:34:04,180
 

4355
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:06,580
 much education you get and so on even

4356
01:34:04,170 --> 01:34:06,580
 

4357
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:08,590
 with things like advertising experiments

4358
01:34:06,570 --> 01:34:08,590
 

4359
01:34:06,580 --> 01:34:09,810
 or getting a drug there's something that

4360
01:34:08,580 --> 01:34:09,810
 

4361
01:34:08,590 --> 01:34:12,310
 you can have things like uh

4362
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:12,310
 

4363
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:14,260
 non-compliance so I can try to show an

4364
01:34:12,300 --> 01:34:14,260
 

4365
01:34:12,310 --> 01:34:16,510
 ad on Facebook but Facebook doesn't

4366
01:34:14,250 --> 01:34:16,510
 

4367
01:34:14,260 --> 01:34:18,610
 actually show it so my I had a

4368
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:18,610
 

4369
01:34:16,510 --> 01:34:19,990
 randomized experiment where I tried to

4370
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:19,990
 

4371
01:34:18,610 --> 01:34:22,420
 show ads to these people and not to

4372
01:34:19,980 --> 01:34:22,420
 

4373
01:34:19,990 --> 01:34:24,040
 those people but some other ad beat me

4374
01:34:22,410 --> 01:34:24,040
 

4375
01:34:22,420 --> 01:34:26,650
 out for some of the people so what's

4376
01:34:24,030 --> 01:34:26,650
 

4377
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:29,410
 random is my intention to treat but not

4378
01:34:26,640 --> 01:34:29,410
 

4379
01:34:26,650 --> 01:34:31,180
 who actually saw the ad and people might

4380
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:31,180
 

4381
01:34:29,410 --> 01:34:32,500
 not comply with a drug trial so those

4382
01:34:31,170 --> 01:34:32,500
 

4383
01:34:31,180 --> 01:34:35,530
 are some of the other big applications

4384
01:34:32,490 --> 01:34:35,530
 

4385
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:37,800
 and instrumental variables so let me

4386
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:37,800
 

4387
01:34:35,530 --> 01:34:39,760
 actually skip over some of the details

4388
01:34:37,790 --> 01:34:39,760
 

4389
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:41,650
 there's something called a local average

4390
01:34:39,750 --> 01:34:41,650
 

4391
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:43,750
 treatment effect which can help get the

4392
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:43,750
 

4393
01:34:41,650 --> 01:34:45,040
 intuition for instrumental variables so

4394
01:34:43,740 --> 01:34:45,040
 

4395
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:47,200
 suppose that the treatment and the

4396
01:34:45,030 --> 01:34:47,200
 

4397
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:49,390
 instrument are both binary so for

4398
01:34:47,190 --> 01:34:49,390
 

4399
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:51,520
 example the treatment is is going being

4400
01:34:49,380 --> 01:34:51,520
 

4401
01:34:49,390 --> 01:34:54,370
 in the military actually no that's not a

4402
01:34:51,510 --> 01:34:54,370
 

4403
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:57,310
 binary so the the treatment is seeing an

4404
01:34:54,360 --> 01:34:57,310
 

4405
01:34:54,370 --> 01:35:00,670
 ad and the instrument is whether you

4406
01:34:57,300 --> 01:35:00,670
 

4407
01:34:57,310 --> 01:35:02,350
 were assigned to the treatment group we

4408
01:35:00,660 --> 01:35:02,350
 

4409
01:35:00,670 --> 01:35:03,700
 have some assumptions relevance means

4410
01:35:02,340 --> 01:35:03,700
 

4411
01:35:02,350 --> 01:35:06,580
 that the instrument has to be correlated

4412
01:35:03,690 --> 01:35:06,580
 

4413
01:35:03,700 --> 01:35:08,710
 with the treatment exclusion means that

4414
01:35:06,570 --> 01:35:08,710
 

4415
01:35:06,580 --> 01:35:10,540
 the instrument has to be random with

4416
01:35:08,700 --> 01:35:10,540
 

4417
01:35:08,710 --> 01:35:12,670
 respect to your potential outcomes so

4418
01:35:10,530 --> 01:35:12,670
 

4419
01:35:10,540 --> 01:35:15,490
 it's people it's it's not related to

4420
01:35:12,660 --> 01:35:15,490
 

4421
01:35:12,670 --> 01:35:17,640
 your treatment effect and then something

4422
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:17,640
 

4423
01:35:15,490 --> 01:35:20,170
 called monotonicity which I'll skip over

4424
01:35:17,630 --> 01:35:20,170
 

4425
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:23,530
 then the local average treatment effect

4426
01:35:20,160 --> 01:35:23,530
 

4427
01:35:20,170 --> 01:35:26,140
 is the ratio of two quantities it's

4428
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:26,140
 

4429
01:35:23,530 --> 01:35:28,330
 first the impact of the instrument on

4430
01:35:26,130 --> 01:35:28,330
 

4431
01:35:26,140 --> 01:35:30,310
 the outcome that's like the reduced form

4432
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:30,310
 

4433
01:35:28,330 --> 01:35:32,680
 so it's like I'm compared that would be

4434
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:32,680
 

4435
01:35:30,310 --> 01:35:35,200
 just comparing the people I assigned to

4436
01:35:32,670 --> 01:35:35,200
 

4437
01:35:32,680 --> 01:35:37,450
 show the ad to the people I didn't show

4438
01:35:35,190 --> 01:35:37,450
 

4439
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:39,250
 the ad or its commits the people I tried

4440
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:39,250
 

4441
01:35:37,450 --> 01:35:41,350
 to give the drug to to the people I

4442
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:41,350
 

4443
01:35:39,250 --> 01:35:42,760
 didn't try to give the drug to then in

4444
01:35:41,340 --> 01:35:42,760
 

4445
01:35:41,350 --> 01:35:45,310
 the denominator is that is the

4446
01:35:42,750 --> 01:35:45,310
 

4447
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:46,239
 expression which says what is the impact

4448
01:35:45,300 --> 01:35:46,239
 

4449
01:35:45,310 --> 01:35:49,119
 of the inch

4450
01:35:46,229 --> 01:35:49,119
 

4451
01:35:46,239 --> 01:35:52,059
 you're meant on the treatment so in a

4452
01:35:49,109 --> 01:35:52,059
 

4453
01:35:49,119 --> 01:35:53,739
 sense how much does being assigned to

4454
01:35:52,049 --> 01:35:53,739
 

4455
01:35:52,059 --> 01:35:56,260
 the treatment group increase your chance

4456
01:35:53,729 --> 01:35:56,260
 

4457
01:35:53,739 --> 01:35:58,679
 of taking the drug and so the ratio of

4458
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:58,679
 

4459
01:35:56,260 --> 01:36:00,999
 those two things as a treatment effect

4460
01:35:58,669 --> 01:36:00,999
 

4461
01:35:58,679 --> 01:36:02,590
 now I can also do this conditional on

4462
01:36:00,989 --> 01:36:02,590
 

4463
01:36:00,999 --> 01:36:05,380
 covariance and that's what I'm showing

4464
01:36:02,580 --> 01:36:05,380
 

4465
01:36:02,590 --> 01:36:06,429
 here and that's gonna be what's gonna be

4466
01:36:05,370 --> 01:36:06,429
 

4467
01:36:05,380 --> 01:36:07,749
 more interesting from the machine

4468
01:36:06,419 --> 01:36:07,749
 

4469
01:36:06,429 --> 01:36:09,340
 learning perspective I might actually

4470
01:36:07,739 --> 01:36:09,340
 

4471
01:36:07,749 --> 01:36:11,110
 have a lot of covariance and I might be

4472
01:36:09,330 --> 01:36:11,110
 

4473
01:36:09,340 --> 01:36:14,619
 interested in heterogeneous treatment

4474
01:36:11,100 --> 01:36:14,619
 

4475
01:36:11,110 --> 01:36:15,820
 effects so there's a bunch of different

4476
01:36:14,609 --> 01:36:15,820
 

4477
01:36:14,619 --> 01:36:18,190
 things you can do with machine learning

4478
01:36:15,810 --> 01:36:18,190
 

4479
01:36:15,820 --> 01:36:19,659
 around instrumental variables so again

4480
01:36:18,180 --> 01:36:19,659
 

4481
01:36:18,190 --> 01:36:22,389
 Victor char Nozick Hoff and co-authors

4482
01:36:19,649 --> 01:36:22,389
 

4483
01:36:19,659 --> 01:36:25,809
 at MIT had an early look at this using

4484
01:36:22,379 --> 01:36:25,809
 

4485
01:36:22,389 --> 01:36:27,610
 lasso models and they basically argued

4486
01:36:25,799 --> 01:36:27,610
 

4487
01:36:25,809 --> 01:36:29,349
 that you could use lasso to try to

4488
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:29,349
 

4489
01:36:27,610 --> 01:36:33,190
 figure out which instruments you should

4490
01:36:29,339 --> 01:36:33,190
 

4491
01:36:29,349 --> 01:36:35,230
 include in your regression and so in

4492
01:36:33,180 --> 01:36:35,230
 

4493
01:36:33,190 --> 01:36:37,389
 particular they would use lasso to

4494
01:36:35,220 --> 01:36:37,389
 

4495
01:36:35,230 --> 01:36:40,749
 select instruments when you have lots

4496
01:36:37,379 --> 01:36:40,749
 

4497
01:36:37,389 --> 01:36:42,309
 and lots of instruments and so you that

4498
01:36:40,739 --> 01:36:42,309
 

4499
01:36:40,749 --> 01:36:43,659
 you can think about different scenarios

4500
01:36:42,299 --> 01:36:43,659
 

4501
01:36:42,309 --> 01:36:45,940
 where you might have lots of instruments

4502
01:36:43,649 --> 01:36:45,940
 

4503
01:36:43,659 --> 01:36:48,130
 one example of this would be in a tech

4504
01:36:45,930 --> 01:36:48,130
 

4505
01:36:45,940 --> 01:36:50,860
 firm so in the background you're running

4506
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:50,860
 

4507
01:36:48,130 --> 01:36:52,960
 lots of a/b tests say you know bang or

4508
01:36:50,850 --> 01:36:52,960
 

4509
01:36:50,860 --> 01:36:54,940
 Google's running hundreds of a/b tests

4510
01:36:52,950 --> 01:36:54,940
 

4511
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:57,309
 at the same time they are designed for

4512
01:36:54,930 --> 01:36:57,309
 

4513
01:36:54,940 --> 01:36:58,989
 different purposes but each a/b test is

4514
01:36:57,299 --> 01:36:58,989
 

4515
01:36:57,309 --> 01:37:01,030
 going to have some impact on the user

4516
01:36:58,979 --> 01:37:01,030
 

4517
01:36:58,989 --> 01:37:03,219
 and so I'll show an example in a minute

4518
01:37:01,020 --> 01:37:03,219
 

4519
01:37:01,030 --> 01:37:05,349
 with ads where we where we found that

4520
01:37:03,209 --> 01:37:05,349
 

4521
01:37:03,219 --> 01:37:08,320
 where we used a B test as an instrument

4522
01:37:05,339 --> 01:37:08,320
 

4523
01:37:05,349 --> 01:37:10,269
 for the ranking of the ads the the

4524
01:37:08,310 --> 01:37:10,269
 

4525
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:12,340
 experiments weren't necessarily designed

4526
01:37:10,259 --> 01:37:12,340
 

4527
01:37:10,269 --> 01:37:14,559
 to change the ranking of ads but they

4528
01:37:12,330 --> 01:37:14,559
 

4529
01:37:12,340 --> 01:37:16,300
 had an impact on the ranking abouts and

4530
01:37:14,549 --> 01:37:16,300
 

4531
01:37:14,559 --> 01:37:18,579
 since the switch treatment group you

4532
01:37:16,290 --> 01:37:18,579
 

4533
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:22,389
 were in was random we could use that as

4534
01:37:18,569 --> 01:37:22,389
 

4535
01:37:18,579 --> 01:37:24,039
 an instrument and so Victor and and his

4536
01:37:22,379 --> 01:37:24,039
 

4537
01:37:22,389 --> 01:37:25,929
 co-authors looked at this in a paper

4538
01:37:24,029 --> 01:37:25,929
 

4539
01:37:24,039 --> 01:37:27,909
 that looked at the effect of years of

4540
01:37:25,919 --> 01:37:27,909
 

4541
01:37:25,929 --> 01:37:30,159
 schooling on labor market outcomes and

4542
01:37:27,899 --> 01:37:30,159
 

4543
01:37:27,909 --> 01:37:32,320
 the instruments were the quarter you

4544
01:37:30,149 --> 01:37:32,320
 

4545
01:37:30,159 --> 01:37:33,699
 were born but also the interactions of

4546
01:37:32,310 --> 01:37:33,699
 

4547
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:35,409
 those with lots of pretreatment

4548
01:37:33,689 --> 01:37:35,409
 

4549
01:37:33,699 --> 01:37:36,999
 variables lots of characteristics of

4550
01:37:35,399 --> 01:37:36,999
 

4551
01:37:35,409 --> 01:37:40,239
 people and they got much more precise

4552
01:37:36,989 --> 01:37:40,239
 

4553
01:37:36,999 --> 01:37:42,130
 estimates one of the experiments I ran

4554
01:37:40,229 --> 01:37:42,130
 

4555
01:37:40,239 --> 01:37:45,280
 when I was at Microsoft was again trying

4556
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:45,280
 

4557
01:37:42,130 --> 01:37:48,610
 to look at the impact of being in higher

4558
01:37:45,270 --> 01:37:48,610
 

4559
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:51,940
 positions for ads so if I looked here's

4560
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:51,940
 

4561
01:37:48,610 --> 01:37:53,499
 two queries iPhone and viagra these are

4562
01:37:51,930 --> 01:37:53,499
 

4563
01:37:51,940 --> 01:37:55,630
 two different queries that people would

4564
01:37:53,489 --> 01:37:55,630
 

4565
01:37:53,499 --> 01:37:58,239
 put into Bing and each of these would

4566
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:58,239
 

4567
01:37:55,630 --> 01:37:59,320
 show ads and so if you just did a simple

4568
01:37:58,229 --> 01:37:59,320
 

4569
01:37:58,239 --> 01:38:03,280
 regression

4570
01:37:59,310 --> 01:38:03,280
 

4571
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:05,590
 of whether the ad was clicked on the

4572
01:38:03,270 --> 01:38:05,590
 

4573
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:07,719
 position effects as well as the

4574
01:38:05,580 --> 01:38:07,719
 

4575
01:38:05,590 --> 01:38:09,040
 identities of the advertisers it would

4576
01:38:07,709 --> 01:38:09,040
 

4577
01:38:07,719 --> 01:38:11,349
 look like there were really strong

4578
01:38:09,030 --> 01:38:11,349
 

4579
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:13,150
 position effects it looked like that

4580
01:38:11,339 --> 01:38:13,150
 

4581
01:38:11,349 --> 01:38:14,679
 being in the second position was about

4582
01:38:13,140 --> 01:38:14,679
 

4583
01:38:13,150 --> 01:38:16,420
 two-thirds as good as being in the first

4584
01:38:14,669 --> 01:38:16,420
 

4585
01:38:14,679 --> 01:38:18,790
 position and then going down to the

4586
01:38:16,410 --> 01:38:18,790
 

4587
01:38:16,420 --> 01:38:21,219
 third position was about 40% and the

4588
01:38:18,780 --> 01:38:21,219
 

4589
01:38:18,790 --> 01:38:22,840
 side position was like 5% so it looked

4590
01:38:21,209 --> 01:38:22,840
 

4591
01:38:21,219 --> 01:38:25,300
 like the clicks were falling off really

4592
01:38:22,830 --> 01:38:25,300
 

4593
01:38:22,840 --> 01:38:27,790
 fast but of course this is not a causal

4594
01:38:25,290 --> 01:38:27,790
 

4595
01:38:25,300 --> 01:38:31,389
 effect because Bing isn't stupid and

4596
01:38:27,780 --> 01:38:31,389
 

4597
01:38:27,790 --> 01:38:33,340
 they put the best ads on top so the the

4598
01:38:31,379 --> 01:38:33,340
 

4599
01:38:31,389 --> 01:38:34,719
 an ad in the second position might get

4600
01:38:33,330 --> 01:38:34,719
 

4601
01:38:33,340 --> 01:38:36,190
 clicked less not just because it's in

4602
01:38:34,709 --> 01:38:36,190
 

4603
01:38:34,719 --> 01:38:39,159
 the second position but also because the

4604
01:38:36,180 --> 01:38:39,159
 

4605
01:38:36,190 --> 01:38:41,320
 ad is less relevant so what we did is we

4606
01:38:39,149 --> 01:38:41,320
 

4607
01:38:39,159 --> 01:38:43,000
 used the identifiers for a whole bunch

4608
01:38:41,310 --> 01:38:43,000
 

4609
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:45,790
 of av-test and again these a beat us

4610
01:38:42,990 --> 01:38:45,790
 

4611
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:47,920
 were not designed to do ranking but they

4612
01:38:45,780 --> 01:38:47,920
 

4613
01:38:45,790 --> 01:38:50,590
 just had the consequence of affecting

4614
01:38:47,910 --> 01:38:50,590
 

4615
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:53,020
 ranking and we use those as instruments

4616
01:38:50,580 --> 01:38:53,020
 

4617
01:38:50,590 --> 01:38:55,300
 for the treatment for the position of

4618
01:38:53,010 --> 01:38:55,300
 

4619
01:38:53,020 --> 01:38:57,550
 the ad and what we found was that the

4620
01:38:55,290 --> 01:38:57,550
 

4621
01:38:55,300 --> 01:39:00,550
 position effects were much flatter than

4622
01:38:57,540 --> 01:39:00,550
 

4623
01:38:57,550 --> 01:39:02,170
 in the the correlation and of course

4624
01:39:00,540 --> 01:39:02,170
 

4625
01:39:00,550 --> 01:39:04,239
 that's what you expect in the

4626
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:04,239
 

4627
01:39:02,170 --> 01:39:05,949
 correlation there's two reasons a lower

4628
01:39:04,229 --> 01:39:05,949
 

4629
01:39:04,239 --> 01:39:07,030
 position would get click less one is

4630
01:39:05,939 --> 01:39:07,030
 

4631
01:39:05,949 --> 01:39:08,949
 because it's in a lower position and

4632
01:39:07,020 --> 01:39:08,949
 

4633
01:39:07,030 --> 01:39:11,260
 second because it's a less good ad so

4634
01:39:08,939 --> 01:39:11,260
 

4635
01:39:08,949 --> 01:39:13,840
 you expect the the clicks fall off

4636
01:39:11,250 --> 01:39:13,840
 

4637
01:39:11,260 --> 01:39:15,760
 faster in terms of correlation then in

4638
01:39:13,830 --> 01:39:15,760
 

4639
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:17,739
 terms of causation and indeed that's

4640
01:39:15,750 --> 01:39:17,739
 

4641
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:19,300
 what we found and separately I ran a

4642
01:39:17,729 --> 01:39:19,300
 

4643
01:39:17,739 --> 01:39:21,760
 bunch of experiments randomizing

4644
01:39:19,290 --> 01:39:21,760
 

4645
01:39:19,300 --> 01:39:23,349
 positions at being and found similar

4646
01:39:21,750 --> 01:39:23,349
 

4647
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:26,590
 results in a purely randomized

4648
01:39:23,339 --> 01:39:26,590
 

4649
01:39:23,349 --> 01:39:28,300
 experiment designed to look at this and

4650
01:39:26,580 --> 01:39:28,300
 

4651
01:39:26,590 --> 01:39:31,630
 so I guess I would just say this is this

4652
01:39:28,290 --> 01:39:31,630
 

4653
01:39:28,300 --> 01:39:33,969
 was an example you know circa 2008 to 10

4654
01:39:31,620 --> 01:39:33,969
 

4655
01:39:31,630 --> 01:39:35,860
 where you know the search engine wasn't

4656
01:39:33,959 --> 01:39:35,860
 

4657
01:39:33,969 --> 01:39:37,780
 really taking this into account so the

4658
01:39:35,850 --> 01:39:37,780
 

4659
01:39:35,860 --> 01:39:39,550
 click prediction model was just using

4660
01:39:37,770 --> 01:39:39,550
 

4661
01:39:37,780 --> 01:39:41,139
 the observational data and trying to

4662
01:39:39,540 --> 01:39:41,139
 

4663
01:39:39,550 --> 01:39:43,329
 control for add effects and position

4664
01:39:41,129 --> 01:39:43,329
 

4665
01:39:41,139 --> 01:39:45,880
 effects but wasn't really factoring in

4666
01:39:43,319 --> 01:39:45,880
 

4667
01:39:43,329 --> 01:39:47,349
 that there was this bias and so indeed

4668
01:39:45,870 --> 01:39:47,349
 

4669
01:39:45,880 --> 01:39:49,060
 we found the estimates and the quick

4670
01:39:47,339 --> 01:39:49,060
 

4671
01:39:47,349 --> 01:39:50,829
 prediction algorithm were biased and

4672
01:39:49,050 --> 01:39:50,829
 

4673
01:39:49,060 --> 01:39:53,650
 then working together with a group of

4674
01:39:50,819 --> 01:39:53,650
 

4675
01:39:50,829 --> 01:39:55,239
 people including Leon but to really let

4676
01:39:53,640 --> 01:39:55,239
 

4677
01:39:53,650 --> 01:39:56,920
 a lot of this work to try to get more

4678
01:39:55,229 --> 01:39:56,920
 

4679
01:39:55,239 --> 01:40:00,400
 experimentation into the click

4680
01:39:56,910 --> 01:40:00,400
 

4681
01:39:56,920 --> 01:40:02,260
 prediction algorithms okay so another

4682
01:40:00,390 --> 01:40:02,260
 

4683
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:04,570
 thing we can try to do is to look at

4684
01:40:02,250 --> 01:40:04,570
 

4685
01:40:02,260 --> 01:40:06,190
 heterogeneous treatment effects so we

4686
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:06,190
 

4687
01:40:04,570 --> 01:40:09,070
 want to understand for whom is a

4688
01:40:06,180 --> 01:40:09,070
 

4689
01:40:06,190 --> 01:40:10,510
 treatment effect large and so I'm going

4690
01:40:09,060 --> 01:40:10,510
 

4691
01:40:09,070 --> 01:40:12,150
 to illustrate this with two different

4692
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:12,150
 

4693
01:40:10,510 --> 01:40:14,400
 approaches why

4694
01:40:12,140 --> 01:40:14,400
 

4695
01:40:12,150 --> 01:40:15,870
 from a paper of mine with Julie chips

4696
01:40:14,390 --> 01:40:15,870
 

4697
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:17,610
 Ronnie and Stefan lager that's just

4698
01:40:15,860 --> 01:40:17,610
 

4699
01:40:15,870 --> 01:40:20,370
 coming out and analyst of statistics and

4700
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:20,370
 

4701
01:40:17,610 --> 01:40:21,980
 another that was by a team of that was

4702
01:40:20,360 --> 01:40:21,980
 

4703
01:40:20,370 --> 01:40:25,560
 at Microsoft Research at the time

4704
01:40:21,970 --> 01:40:25,560
 

4705
01:40:21,980 --> 01:40:28,230
 including Matt Teddy Greg Lewis and

4706
01:40:25,550 --> 01:40:28,230
 

4707
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:32,130
 Kevin Leighton brown from UBC and that's

4708
01:40:28,220 --> 01:40:32,130
 

4709
01:40:28,230 --> 01:40:34,980
 using neural nuts so I'll start with the

4710
01:40:32,120 --> 01:40:34,980
 

4711
01:40:32,130 --> 01:40:37,440
 neural net approach so first of all

4712
01:40:34,970 --> 01:40:37,440
 

4713
01:40:34,980 --> 01:40:39,540
 here's a little causal diagram showing

4714
01:40:37,430 --> 01:40:39,540
 

4715
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:41,910
 the instrumental variables application

4716
01:40:39,530 --> 01:40:41,910
 

4717
01:40:39,540 --> 01:40:43,590
 that they were looking at so they were

4718
01:40:41,900 --> 01:40:43,590
 

4719
01:40:41,910 --> 01:40:47,310
 interested in trying to understand the

4720
01:40:43,580 --> 01:40:47,310
 

4721
01:40:43,590 --> 01:40:49,950
 effect of price in this example and so

4722
01:40:47,300 --> 01:40:49,950
 

4723
01:40:47,310 --> 01:40:51,720
 the the goal is to understand say for a

4724
01:40:49,940 --> 01:40:51,720
 

4725
01:40:49,950 --> 01:40:53,700
 firm what happens if they change their

4726
01:40:51,710 --> 01:40:53,700
 

4727
01:40:51,720 --> 01:40:55,770
 price and by the way this was part of a

4728
01:40:53,690 --> 01:40:55,770
 

4729
01:40:53,700 --> 01:40:57,900
 project that that this team was working

4730
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:57,900
 

4731
01:40:55,770 --> 01:40:59,340
 on to try to commercialize some machine

4732
01:40:57,890 --> 01:40:59,340
 

4733
01:40:57,900 --> 01:41:01,410
 learning algorithms that were designed

4734
01:40:59,330 --> 01:41:01,410
 

4735
01:40:59,340 --> 01:41:03,120
 to help firms make decisions with the

4736
01:41:01,400 --> 01:41:03,120
 

4737
01:41:01,410 --> 01:41:04,620
 idea that a lot of firms want to do

4738
01:41:03,110 --> 01:41:04,620
 

4739
01:41:03,120 --> 01:41:07,190
 causal inference about things like

4740
01:41:04,610 --> 01:41:07,190
 

4741
01:41:04,620 --> 01:41:11,520
 prices not just you know do prediction

4742
01:41:07,180 --> 01:41:11,520
 

4743
01:41:07,190 --> 01:41:14,850
 so the causal diagram shows that there's

4744
01:41:11,510 --> 01:41:14,850
 

4745
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:17,730
 a bunch of things that affect price so

4746
01:41:14,840 --> 01:41:17,730
 

4747
01:41:14,850 --> 01:41:19,440
 in in the firm's historical data there

4748
01:41:17,720 --> 01:41:19,440
 

4749
01:41:17,730 --> 01:41:21,930
 might have been shocks things that

4750
01:41:19,430 --> 01:41:21,930
 

4751
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:25,140
 caused the firm to change the price that

4752
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:25,140
 

4753
01:41:21,930 --> 01:41:27,150
 were also related to outcomes why so you

4754
01:41:25,130 --> 01:41:27,150
 

4755
01:41:25,140 --> 01:41:29,640
 know the firm might raise their price in

4756
01:41:27,140 --> 01:41:29,640
 

4757
01:41:27,150 --> 01:41:31,830
 a high demand day and that II that would

4758
01:41:29,630 --> 01:41:31,830
 

4759
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:33,330
 be the unobservable it's not not

4760
01:41:31,820 --> 01:41:33,330
 

4761
01:41:31,830 --> 01:41:35,730
 observed to the analyst but it was the

4762
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:35,730
 

4763
01:41:33,330 --> 01:41:38,700
 thing that caused the firm to both raise

4764
01:41:35,720 --> 01:41:38,700
 

4765
01:41:35,730 --> 01:41:40,770
 the price and have high demand there's

4766
01:41:38,690 --> 01:41:40,770
 

4767
01:41:38,700 --> 01:41:43,140
 also some co-vary it's X these are sort

4768
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:43,140
 

4769
01:41:40,770 --> 01:41:46,920
 of just characteristics of the context

4770
01:41:43,130 --> 01:41:46,920
 

4771
01:41:43,140 --> 01:41:49,200
 and then Z are the instruments and so Z

4772
01:41:46,910 --> 01:41:49,200
 

4773
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:52,140
 for for the case of price they might be

4774
01:41:49,190 --> 01:41:52,140
 

4775
01:41:49,200 --> 01:41:54,270
 cost shocks they might be randomized

4776
01:41:52,130 --> 01:41:54,270
 

4777
01:41:52,140 --> 01:41:55,770
 experiments the firm ran if it was kind

4778
01:41:54,260 --> 01:41:55,770
 

4779
01:41:54,270 --> 01:41:57,990
 of more of a tech firm or more pricing

4780
01:41:55,760 --> 01:41:57,990
 

4781
01:41:55,770 --> 01:42:00,090
 online but and Z would be something

4782
01:41:57,980 --> 01:42:00,090
 

4783
01:41:57,990 --> 01:42:02,820
 that's affecting the price that's not

4784
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:02,820
 

4785
01:42:00,090 --> 01:42:04,680
 related to demand and so again in in

4786
01:42:02,810 --> 01:42:04,680
 

4787
01:42:02,820 --> 01:42:06,210
 economic applications historically we

4788
01:42:04,670 --> 01:42:06,210
 

4789
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:07,680
 looked for things like cost shocks that

4790
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:07,680
 

4791
01:42:06,210 --> 01:42:09,180
 would cause firms to change the price

4792
01:42:07,670 --> 01:42:09,180
 

4793
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:12,600
 but for reasons that were unrelated to

4794
01:42:09,170 --> 01:42:12,600
 

4795
01:42:09,180 --> 01:42:19,200
 demand and so the the key thing is that

4796
01:42:12,590 --> 01:42:19,200
 

4797
01:42:12,600 --> 01:42:22,349
 is that the Z is excluded from the

4798
01:42:19,190 --> 01:42:22,349
 

4799
01:42:19,200 --> 01:42:26,429
 outcome relationship so Z

4800
01:42:22,339 --> 01:42:26,429
 

4801
01:42:22,349 --> 01:42:29,369
 not directly affecting the it's not

4802
01:42:26,419 --> 01:42:29,369
 

4803
01:42:26,429 --> 01:42:31,619
 directly related to the say the demand

4804
01:42:29,359 --> 01:42:31,619
 

4805
01:42:29,369 --> 01:42:34,229
 for the firm that day and so what that

4806
01:42:31,609 --> 01:42:34,229
 

4807
01:42:31,619 --> 01:42:36,359
 means is that I can I can write the

4808
01:42:34,219 --> 01:42:36,359
 

4809
01:42:34,229 --> 01:42:39,059
 expectation of outcomes conditional on X

4810
01:42:36,349 --> 01:42:39,059
 

4811
01:42:36,359 --> 01:42:41,189
 and Z in a very particular way here I'm

4812
01:42:39,049 --> 01:42:41,189
 

4813
01:42:39,059 --> 01:42:43,859
 writing it as an integral and I'm saying

4814
01:42:41,179 --> 01:42:43,859
 

4815
01:42:41,189 --> 01:42:45,929
 okay there's some function G of P and X

4816
01:42:43,849 --> 01:42:45,929
 

4817
01:42:43,859 --> 01:42:48,209
 and that's telling me basically

4818
01:42:45,919 --> 01:42:48,209
 

4819
01:42:45,929 --> 01:42:51,629
 something about how changing price is

4820
01:42:48,199 --> 01:42:51,629
 

4821
01:42:48,209 --> 01:42:54,119
 going to change outcomes and there's

4822
01:42:51,619 --> 01:42:54,119
 

4823
01:42:51,629 --> 01:42:57,059
 also in the historical data there was

4824
01:42:54,109 --> 01:42:57,059
 

4825
01:42:54,119 --> 01:42:59,340
 some distribution of prices and prices

4826
01:42:57,049 --> 01:42:59,340
 

4827
01:42:57,059 --> 01:43:01,739
 tended to be on average different in in

4828
01:42:59,330 --> 01:43:01,739
 

4829
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:04,379
 different contexts X and prices were

4830
01:43:01,729 --> 01:43:04,379
 

4831
01:43:01,739 --> 01:43:06,329
 also different with different Z's but

4832
01:43:04,369 --> 01:43:06,329
 

4833
01:43:04,379 --> 01:43:08,189
 the key is that the Z is not in the G

4834
01:43:06,319 --> 01:43:08,189
 

4835
01:43:06,329 --> 01:43:10,530
 function that's the formalization of the

4836
01:43:08,179 --> 01:43:10,530
 

4837
01:43:08,189 --> 01:43:12,329
 exclusion restriction Z is something

4838
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:12,329
 

4839
01:43:10,530 --> 01:43:14,099
 that's the shifting prices that's

4840
01:43:12,319 --> 01:43:14,099
 

4841
01:43:12,329 --> 01:43:17,280
 shifting the price distribution but it's

4842
01:43:14,089 --> 01:43:17,280
 

4843
01:43:14,099 --> 01:43:19,499
 not actually affecting the overall

4844
01:43:17,270 --> 01:43:19,499
 

4845
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:21,419
 demand relationship and that exclusion

4846
01:43:19,489 --> 01:43:21,419
 

4847
01:43:19,499 --> 01:43:23,309
 restriction is what allows you to

4848
01:43:21,409 --> 01:43:23,309
 

4849
01:43:21,419 --> 01:43:25,109
 actually learn about the effects of

4850
01:43:23,299 --> 01:43:25,109
 

4851
01:43:23,309 --> 01:43:27,809
 price on demand without that you don't

4852
01:43:25,099 --> 01:43:27,809
 

4853
01:43:25,109 --> 01:43:29,969
 have a good way to learn that and so

4854
01:43:27,799 --> 01:43:29,969
 

4855
01:43:27,809 --> 01:43:32,939
 what they argue is that we can use

4856
01:43:29,959 --> 01:43:32,939
 

4857
01:43:29,969 --> 01:43:35,669
 neural nets to solve these two different

4858
01:43:32,929 --> 01:43:35,669
 

4859
01:43:32,939 --> 01:43:37,769
 parts of the problem first of all I can

4860
01:43:35,659 --> 01:43:37,769
 

4861
01:43:35,669 --> 01:43:40,379
 just solve the problem of figuring out

4862
01:43:37,759 --> 01:43:40,379
 

4863
01:43:37,769 --> 01:43:42,389
 how to X and Z predict Y that's a

4864
01:43:40,369 --> 01:43:42,389
 

4865
01:43:40,379 --> 01:43:44,159
 prediction problem that's understanding

4866
01:43:42,379 --> 01:43:44,159
 

4867
01:43:42,389 --> 01:43:46,439
 what that whole integral looks like but

4868
01:43:44,149 --> 01:43:46,439
 

4869
01:43:44,159 --> 01:43:48,929
 separately I can also use neural nets to

4870
01:43:46,429 --> 01:43:48,929
 

4871
01:43:46,439 --> 01:43:51,449
 figure out how to X and Z affect price

4872
01:43:48,919 --> 01:43:51,449
 

4873
01:43:48,929 --> 01:43:53,309
 and then I've got this integral that

4874
01:43:51,439 --> 01:43:53,309
 

4875
01:43:51,449 --> 01:43:55,889
 says how they fit together and I can

4876
01:43:53,299 --> 01:43:55,889
 

4877
01:43:53,309 --> 01:43:57,659
 basically try to invert that now this is

4878
01:43:55,879 --> 01:43:57,659
 

4879
01:43:55,889 --> 01:43:59,849
 economist have thought about this for a

4880
01:43:57,649 --> 01:43:59,849
 

4881
01:43:57,659 --> 01:44:01,619
 long time I'm citing here a paper by Nui

4882
01:43:59,839 --> 01:44:01,619
 

4883
01:43:59,849 --> 01:44:03,209
 and Powell from 2003 which was actually

4884
01:44:01,609 --> 01:44:03,209
 

4885
01:44:01,619 --> 01:44:05,399
 written in the early 90s I told you we

4886
01:44:03,199 --> 01:44:05,399
 

4887
01:44:03,209 --> 01:44:06,959
 take 10 years to publish our papers and

4888
01:44:05,389 --> 01:44:06,959
 

4889
01:44:05,399 --> 01:44:08,789
 so you know this this approach had been

4890
01:44:06,949 --> 01:44:08,789
 

4891
01:44:06,959 --> 01:44:11,159
 used for a long time it's just that we

4892
01:44:08,779 --> 01:44:11,159
 

4893
01:44:08,789 --> 01:44:12,989
 never operationalized it it very well in

4894
01:44:11,149 --> 01:44:12,989
 

4895
01:44:11,159 --> 01:44:15,989
 high dimensions we had we had great

4896
01:44:12,979 --> 01:44:15,989
 

4897
01:44:12,989 --> 01:44:17,639
 theory but no practical algorithms so

4898
01:44:15,979 --> 01:44:17,639
 

4899
01:44:15,989 --> 01:44:18,959
 the typical way that we would done this

4900
01:44:17,629 --> 01:44:18,959
 

4901
01:44:17,639 --> 01:44:20,820
 in economics is we've just assumed

4902
01:44:18,949 --> 01:44:20,820
 

4903
01:44:18,959 --> 01:44:22,499
 everything was linear and then if

4904
01:44:20,810 --> 01:44:22,499
 

4905
01:44:20,820 --> 01:44:24,329
 everything was linear we could just run

4906
01:44:22,489 --> 01:44:24,329
 

4907
01:44:22,499 --> 01:44:27,030
 this with regressions and inverting this

4908
01:44:24,319 --> 01:44:27,030
 

4909
01:44:24,329 --> 01:44:30,179
 would be very easy because if if

4910
01:44:27,020 --> 01:44:30,179
 

4911
01:44:27,030 --> 01:44:32,129
 everything was just linear then my my

4912
01:44:30,169 --> 01:44:32,129
 

4913
01:44:30,179 --> 01:44:34,649
 demand function would just be some

4914
01:44:32,119 --> 01:44:34,649
 

4915
01:44:32,129 --> 01:44:35,849
 parameter times the price I could just

4916
01:44:34,639 --> 01:44:35,849
 

4917
01:44:34,649 --> 01:44:38,940
 pull that out of the integral

4918
01:44:35,839 --> 01:44:38,940
 

4919
01:44:35,849 --> 01:44:40,980
 so if I could just estimate how Z the

4920
01:44:38,930 --> 01:44:40,980
 

4921
01:44:38,940 --> 01:44:44,010
 instrument affects prices and if I could

4922
01:44:40,970 --> 01:44:44,010
 

4923
01:44:40,980 --> 01:44:46,829
 just affect how Z affects affects

4924
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,829
 

4925
01:44:44,010 --> 01:44:48,929
 outcomes just take the ratio and that

4926
01:44:46,819 --> 01:44:48,929
 

4927
01:44:46,829 --> 01:44:50,250
 would be my estimate of tau so that

4928
01:44:48,919 --> 01:44:50,250
 

4929
01:44:48,929 --> 01:44:51,480
 would be a very easy thing to do and

4930
01:44:50,240 --> 01:44:51,480
 

4931
01:44:50,250 --> 01:44:53,040
 that's called two stage least squares

4932
01:44:51,470 --> 01:44:53,040
 

4933
01:44:51,480 --> 01:44:56,190
 and again that's a staple of like

4934
01:44:53,030 --> 01:44:56,190
 

4935
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:57,989
 undergraduate econometrics we did then

4936
01:44:56,180 --> 01:44:57,989
 

4937
01:44:56,190 --> 01:45:00,570
 tried to make this more complicated with

4938
01:44:57,979 --> 01:45:00,570
 

4939
01:44:57,989 --> 01:45:02,310
 thieves and other types of nonlinear

4940
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:02,310
 

4941
01:45:00,570 --> 01:45:05,940
 functions but it just never worked very

4942
01:45:02,300 --> 01:45:05,940
 

4943
01:45:02,310 --> 01:45:07,889
 well so nobody ever adopted it so now

4944
01:45:05,930 --> 01:45:07,889
 

4945
01:45:05,940 --> 01:45:09,630
 they've what they what this paper deep

4946
01:45:07,879 --> 01:45:09,630
 

4947
01:45:07,889 --> 01:45:12,239
 Ivy suggests is let's go back and

4948
01:45:09,620 --> 01:45:12,239
 

4949
01:45:09,630 --> 01:45:14,070
 actually target this loss function

4950
01:45:12,229 --> 01:45:14,070
 

4951
01:45:12,239 --> 01:45:15,960
 directly they're gonna change the

4952
01:45:14,060 --> 01:45:15,960
 

4953
01:45:14,070 --> 01:45:19,020
 objective function but they're gonna use

4954
01:45:15,950 --> 01:45:19,020
 

4955
01:45:15,960 --> 01:45:22,260
 neural nets to basically analyze each of

4956
01:45:19,010 --> 01:45:22,260
 

4957
01:45:19,020 --> 01:45:24,690
 these functions and then try to find the

4958
01:45:22,250 --> 01:45:24,690
 

4959
01:45:22,260 --> 01:45:26,790
 demand function that actually minimizes

4960
01:45:24,680 --> 01:45:26,790
 

4961
01:45:24,690 --> 01:45:28,349
 the loss function so they've turned this

4962
01:45:26,780 --> 01:45:28,349
 

4963
01:45:26,790 --> 01:45:30,929
 causal inference problem into two

4964
01:45:28,339 --> 01:45:30,929
 

4965
01:45:28,349 --> 01:45:34,980
 generic machine learning tasks and and

4966
01:45:30,919 --> 01:45:34,980
 

4967
01:45:30,929 --> 01:45:36,840
 applied them so they actually I the the

4968
01:45:34,970 --> 01:45:36,840
 

4969
01:45:34,980 --> 01:45:39,750
 earlier Ivy regressions or things that I

4970
01:45:36,830 --> 01:45:39,750
 

4971
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:41,699
 did in in the late 2000s they came back

4972
01:45:39,740 --> 01:45:41,699
 

4973
01:45:39,750 --> 01:45:43,860
 and did a much more thorough job with

4974
01:45:41,689 --> 01:45:43,860
 

4975
01:45:41,699 --> 01:45:47,909
 this same application of trying to

4976
01:45:43,850 --> 01:45:47,909
 

4977
01:45:43,860 --> 01:45:50,369
 understand the impact of of position on

4978
01:45:47,899 --> 01:45:50,369
 

4979
01:45:47,909 --> 01:45:53,670
 the click-through rate at Bing ads and

4980
01:45:50,359 --> 01:45:53,670
 

4981
01:45:50,369 --> 01:45:56,040
 so then so not only now were they trying

4982
01:45:53,660 --> 01:45:56,040
 

4983
01:45:53,670 --> 01:45:57,179
 to estimate the effective position but

4984
01:45:56,030 --> 01:45:57,179
 

4985
01:45:56,040 --> 01:46:00,060
 they were trying to understand the

4986
01:45:57,169 --> 01:46:00,060
 

4987
01:45:57,179 --> 01:46:02,219
 heterogeneous effects so some kinds of

4988
01:46:00,050 --> 01:46:02,219
 

4989
01:46:00,060 --> 01:46:03,300
 queries are brand queries and some are

4990
01:46:02,209 --> 01:46:03,300
 

4991
01:46:02,219 --> 01:46:05,400
 not brand queries

4992
01:46:03,290 --> 01:46:05,400
 

4993
01:46:03,300 --> 01:46:07,560
 some are navigational queries and some

4994
01:46:05,390 --> 01:46:07,560
 

4995
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:10,679
 are not navigational queries and in

4996
01:46:07,550 --> 01:46:10,679
 

4997
01:46:07,560 --> 01:46:13,079
 addition some queries are for websites

4998
01:46:10,669 --> 01:46:13,079
 

4999
01:46:10,679 --> 01:46:16,079
 that are very popular and other queries

5000
01:46:13,069 --> 01:46:16,079
 

5001
01:46:13,079 --> 01:46:18,840
 are less popular and so they they use

5002
01:46:16,069 --> 01:46:18,840
 

5003
01:46:16,079 --> 01:46:20,909
 this deep IV approach to try to look at

5004
01:46:18,830 --> 01:46:20,909
 

5005
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:22,139
 the causal effect of position and see

5006
01:46:20,899 --> 01:46:22,139
 

5007
01:46:20,909 --> 01:46:24,300
 how it changed with all of these

5008
01:46:22,129 --> 01:46:24,300
 

5009
01:46:22,139 --> 01:46:26,760
 different covariance and again they used

5010
01:46:24,290 --> 01:46:26,760
 

5011
01:46:24,300 --> 01:46:29,219
 the a B test IDs as instruments the a/b

5012
01:46:26,750 --> 01:46:29,219
 

5013
01:46:26,760 --> 01:46:30,869
 tests were not designed to shift the

5014
01:46:29,209 --> 01:46:30,869
 

5015
01:46:29,219 --> 01:46:32,460
 ranking but they just had that as a

5016
01:46:30,859 --> 01:46:32,460
 

5017
01:46:30,869 --> 01:46:34,590
 consequence in each particular

5018
01:46:32,450 --> 01:46:34,590
 

5019
01:46:32,460 --> 01:46:36,060
 experiment only had a small effect but

5020
01:46:34,580 --> 01:46:36,060
 

5021
01:46:34,590 --> 01:46:37,739
 there were lots of experiments so they

5022
01:46:36,050 --> 01:46:37,739
 

5023
01:46:36,060 --> 01:46:40,889
 basically had lots of small natural

5024
01:46:37,729 --> 01:46:40,889
 

5025
01:46:37,739 --> 01:46:43,260
 experiments in the data and for example

5026
01:46:40,879 --> 01:46:43,260
 

5027
01:46:40,889 --> 01:46:45,150
 they found that for for off-brand

5028
01:46:43,250 --> 01:46:45,150
 

5029
01:46:43,260 --> 01:46:47,820
 queries the position effect was fairly

5030
01:46:45,140 --> 01:46:47,820
 

5031
01:46:45,150 --> 01:46:48,850
 constant with the with the website rank

5032
01:46:47,810 --> 01:46:48,850
 

5033
01:46:47,820 --> 01:46:52,690
 that was clicked on

5034
01:46:48,840 --> 01:46:52,690
 

5035
01:46:48,850 --> 01:46:54,520
 but for brand queries they found that

5036
01:46:52,680 --> 01:46:54,520
 

5037
01:46:52,690 --> 01:46:57,940
 the position effects were much stronger

5038
01:46:54,510 --> 01:46:57,940
 

5039
01:46:54,520 --> 01:46:59,560
 for unpopular websites so that these low

5040
01:46:57,930 --> 01:46:59,560
 

5041
01:46:57,940 --> 01:47:00,940
 numbers mean that the relative quick

5042
01:46:59,550 --> 01:47:00,940
 

5043
01:46:59,560 --> 01:47:03,010
 rate of say being in the second position

5044
01:47:00,930 --> 01:47:03,010
 

5045
01:47:00,940 --> 01:47:05,080
 was much lower than being in the first

5046
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,080
 

5047
01:47:03,010 --> 01:47:07,420
 position but if you were a very popular

5048
01:47:05,070 --> 01:47:07,420
 

5049
01:47:05,080 --> 01:47:09,160
 brand website then being demoted to the

5050
01:47:07,410 --> 01:47:09,160
 

5051
01:47:07,420 --> 01:47:10,720
 second position didn't do much to your

5052
01:47:09,150 --> 01:47:10,720
 

5053
01:47:09,160 --> 01:47:12,100
 click-through rate because people who

5054
01:47:10,710 --> 01:47:12,100
 

5055
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:14,500
 were looking for you would click on you

5056
01:47:12,090 --> 01:47:14,500
 

5057
01:47:12,100 --> 01:47:17,380
 anyways so manipulation in some sense

5058
01:47:14,490 --> 01:47:17,380
 

5059
01:47:14,500 --> 01:47:20,380
 would be less effective for an in in

5060
01:47:17,370 --> 01:47:20,380
 

5061
01:47:17,380 --> 01:47:22,570
 reducing clicks for brand queries and

5062
01:47:20,370 --> 01:47:22,570
 

5063
01:47:20,380 --> 01:47:24,010
 actually I have a PhD student I mean

5064
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:24,010
 

5065
01:47:22,570 --> 01:47:25,690
 actually undergrad student who's now

5066
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:25,690
 

5067
01:47:24,010 --> 01:47:27,160
 applying for PhD programs who took my

5068
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:27,160
 

5069
01:47:25,690 --> 01:47:29,860
 class and he did another nice

5070
01:47:27,150 --> 01:47:29,860
 

5071
01:47:27,160 --> 01:47:34,000
 application of deep deep Ivy in genetics

5072
01:47:29,850 --> 01:47:34,000
 

5073
01:47:29,860 --> 01:47:36,520
 and there you can think about the your

5074
01:47:33,990 --> 01:47:36,520
 

5075
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:38,110
 genes as being random and they're

5076
01:47:36,510 --> 01:47:38,110
 

5077
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:39,940
 affecting the probability of you getting

5078
01:47:38,100 --> 01:47:39,940
 

5079
01:47:38,110 --> 01:47:42,220
 a disease for reasons other than

5080
01:47:39,930 --> 01:47:42,220
 

5081
01:47:39,940 --> 01:47:45,700
 behavior and what you eat and so he made

5082
01:47:42,210 --> 01:47:45,700
 

5083
01:47:42,220 --> 01:47:48,820
 a nice application of deep Ivy to try to

5084
01:47:45,690 --> 01:47:48,820
 

5085
01:47:45,700 --> 01:47:51,670
 understand the effects of disease and

5086
01:47:48,810 --> 01:47:51,670
 

5087
01:47:48,820 --> 01:47:55,390
 and treatments so that was a nice

5088
01:47:51,660 --> 01:47:55,390
 

5089
01:47:51,670 --> 01:47:57,070
 application of this technique as well so

5090
01:47:55,380 --> 01:47:57,070
 

5091
01:47:55,390 --> 01:47:58,540
 now I'll tell you about one of the

5092
01:47:57,060 --> 01:47:58,540
 

5093
01:47:57,070 --> 01:48:00,010
 methods that I've been spending a lot of

5094
01:47:58,530 --> 01:48:00,010
 

5095
01:47:58,540 --> 01:48:02,220
 time on which is generalized random

5096
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,220
 

5097
01:48:00,010 --> 01:48:06,040
 forests I know random forests seem very

5098
01:48:02,210 --> 01:48:06,040
 

5099
01:48:02,220 --> 01:48:08,950
 you know very old-fashioned to to this

5100
01:48:06,030 --> 01:48:08,950
 

5101
01:48:06,040 --> 01:48:11,980
 audience but nonetheless they still work

5102
01:48:08,940 --> 01:48:11,980
 

5103
01:48:08,950 --> 01:48:13,600
 pretty well out of the box and they turn

5104
01:48:11,970 --> 01:48:13,600
 

5105
01:48:11,980 --> 01:48:15,460
 out to have really nice statistical

5106
01:48:13,590 --> 01:48:15,460
 

5107
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:16,780
 properties and so we've been actually

5108
01:48:15,450 --> 01:48:16,780
 

5109
01:48:15,460 --> 01:48:18,730
 getting a lot of traction on them and

5110
01:48:16,770 --> 01:48:18,730
 

5111
01:48:16,780 --> 01:48:20,110
 Social Sciences because we're able to do

5112
01:48:18,720 --> 01:48:20,110
 

5113
01:48:18,730 --> 01:48:22,330
 things like prove asymptotic normality

5114
01:48:20,100 --> 01:48:22,330
 

5115
01:48:20,110 --> 01:48:24,190
 and get confidence intervals which are

5116
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:24,190
 

5117
01:48:22,330 --> 01:48:26,290
 still somewhat elusive for neural nets

5118
01:48:24,180 --> 01:48:26,290
 

5119
01:48:24,190 --> 01:48:28,660
 although there is progress being made on

5120
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:28,660
 

5121
01:48:26,290 --> 01:48:32,800
 that including by some colleagues at

5122
01:48:28,650 --> 01:48:32,800
 

5123
01:48:28,660 --> 01:48:34,420
 Chicago so the basic idea of what we're

5124
01:48:32,790 --> 01:48:34,420
 

5125
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:36,760
 doing with generalized random forests is

5126
01:48:34,410 --> 01:48:36,760
 

5127
01:48:34,420 --> 01:48:40,090
 we're trying to think about doing local

5128
01:48:36,750 --> 01:48:40,090
 

5129
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:42,790
 estimation and we basically reinterpret

5130
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:42,790
 

5131
01:48:40,090 --> 01:48:45,100
 random forests as a way to generate

5132
01:48:42,780 --> 01:48:45,100
 

5133
01:48:42,790 --> 01:48:47,050
 neighborhood functions and so we say if

5134
01:48:45,090 --> 01:48:47,050
 

5135
01:48:45,100 --> 01:48:48,490
 I want to make a figure out the

5136
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:48,490
 

5137
01:48:47,050 --> 01:48:50,920
 treatment effect for you

5138
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:50,920
 

5139
01:48:48,490 --> 01:48:53,080
 I'm gonna build a bunch of trees and

5140
01:48:50,910 --> 01:48:53,080
 

5141
01:48:50,920 --> 01:48:55,660
 people who are more likely in the same

5142
01:48:53,070 --> 01:48:55,660
 

5143
01:48:53,080 --> 01:48:57,130
 leaf as you are going to be people I

5144
01:48:55,650 --> 01:48:57,130
 

5145
01:48:55,660 --> 01:48:59,030
 consider to be your neighbor I'm going

5146
01:48:57,120 --> 01:48:59,030
 

5147
01:48:57,130 --> 01:49:00,860
 to label them to be more

5148
01:48:59,020 --> 01:49:00,860
 

5149
01:48:59,030 --> 01:49:03,230
 like you and so then I'm gonna run

5150
01:49:00,850 --> 01:49:03,230
 

5151
01:49:00,860 --> 01:49:05,239
 analyses like instrumental variables but

5152
01:49:03,220 --> 01:49:05,239
 

5153
01:49:03,230 --> 01:49:07,340
 I'm but I'm gonna run them separately

5154
01:49:05,229 --> 01:49:07,340
 

5155
01:49:05,239 --> 01:49:09,650
 for each covariate value and I'm gonna

5156
01:49:07,330 --> 01:49:09,650
 

5157
01:49:07,340 --> 01:49:11,239
 do a local analysis waiting more heavily

5158
01:49:09,640 --> 01:49:11,239
 

5159
01:49:09,650 --> 01:49:13,699
 the people that are similar to you

5160
01:49:11,229 --> 01:49:13,699
 

5161
01:49:11,239 --> 01:49:16,159
 there's a lot of computational work that

5162
01:49:13,689 --> 01:49:16,159
 

5163
01:49:13,699 --> 01:49:17,929
 goes into this particularly because we

5164
01:49:16,149 --> 01:49:17,929
 

5165
01:49:16,159 --> 01:49:20,510
 want to make sure that we're looking for

5166
01:49:17,919 --> 01:49:20,510
 

5167
01:49:17,929 --> 01:49:21,619
 for heterogeneity and parameters so our

5168
01:49:20,500 --> 01:49:21,619
 

5169
01:49:20,510 --> 01:49:23,539
 goal again is treatment effect

5170
01:49:21,609 --> 01:49:23,539
 

5171
01:49:21,619 --> 01:49:25,909
 heterogeneity not predicting outcomes

5172
01:49:23,529 --> 01:49:25,909
 

5173
01:49:23,539 --> 01:49:28,099
 and so we optimize our random forests

5174
01:49:25,899 --> 01:49:28,099
 

5175
01:49:25,909 --> 01:49:31,510
 splitting rules for the the

5176
01:49:28,089 --> 01:49:31,510
 

5177
01:49:28,099 --> 01:49:35,389
 heterogeneity in the parameter estimates

5178
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:35,389
 

5179
01:49:31,510 --> 01:49:36,949
 and so we have a imagine a setting where

5180
01:49:35,379 --> 01:49:36,949
 

5181
01:49:35,389 --> 01:49:38,449
 we have a parameter of interest theta of

5182
01:49:36,939 --> 01:49:38,449
 

5183
01:49:36,949 --> 01:49:40,579
 X that would still be like the treatment

5184
01:49:38,439 --> 01:49:40,579
 

5185
01:49:38,449 --> 01:49:42,559
 effect and we have some moment

5186
01:49:40,569 --> 01:49:42,559
 

5187
01:49:40,579 --> 01:49:46,099
 conditions or maybe maximum likelihood

5188
01:49:42,549 --> 01:49:46,099
 

5189
01:49:42,559 --> 01:49:48,170
 equations that tell us how to estimate

5190
01:49:46,089 --> 01:49:48,170
 

5191
01:49:46,099 --> 01:49:50,360
 the parameter but we want to do it

5192
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:50,360
 

5193
01:49:48,170 --> 01:49:52,250
 locally we want to make it a function of

5194
01:49:50,350 --> 01:49:52,250
 

5195
01:49:50,360 --> 01:49:56,570
 X and we want to do that very flexibly

5196
01:49:52,240 --> 01:49:56,570
 

5197
01:49:52,250 --> 01:49:58,219
 and so we this moment depends on our

5198
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:58,219
 

5199
01:49:56,570 --> 01:50:00,920
 parameter of interest theta it also

5200
01:49:58,209 --> 01:50:00,920
 

5201
01:49:58,219 --> 01:50:03,050
 pends on nuisance parameters and so in

5202
01:50:00,910 --> 01:50:03,050
 

5203
01:50:00,920 --> 01:50:04,039
 the case of IV regression there's a

5204
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:04,039
 

5205
01:50:03,050 --> 01:50:06,170
 bunch of different ways you can write

5206
01:50:04,029 --> 01:50:06,170
 

5207
01:50:04,039 --> 01:50:08,719
 down how you estimate IV but one way is

5208
01:50:06,160 --> 01:50:08,719
 

5209
01:50:06,170 --> 01:50:11,300
 to write it down in terms of a moment

5210
01:50:08,709 --> 01:50:11,300
 

5211
01:50:08,719 --> 01:50:14,030
 condition where you multiply you want to

5212
01:50:11,290 --> 01:50:14,030
 

5213
01:50:11,300 --> 01:50:16,190
 set equal to zero the the product of the

5214
01:50:14,020 --> 01:50:16,190
 

5215
01:50:14,030 --> 01:50:18,380
 instrument and the residual of a

5216
01:50:16,180 --> 01:50:18,380
 

5217
01:50:16,190 --> 01:50:21,320
 regression of the outcome on the actual

5218
01:50:18,370 --> 01:50:21,320
 

5219
01:50:18,380 --> 01:50:23,179
 treatment assignment and so those moment

5220
01:50:21,310 --> 01:50:23,179
 

5221
01:50:21,320 --> 01:50:26,329
 conditions can then be estimated locally

5222
01:50:23,169 --> 01:50:26,329
 

5223
01:50:23,179 --> 01:50:28,190
 as a function of X and so the moment the

5224
01:50:26,319 --> 01:50:28,190
 

5225
01:50:26,329 --> 01:50:30,679
 way we would operationalize that is that

5226
01:50:28,180 --> 01:50:30,679
 

5227
01:50:28,190 --> 01:50:33,559
 for each target X we would create a

5228
01:50:30,669 --> 01:50:33,559
 

5229
01:50:30,679 --> 01:50:34,789
 weighting function alpha and we would we

5230
01:50:33,549 --> 01:50:34,789
 

5231
01:50:33,559 --> 01:50:36,530
 would set the moment we would try to

5232
01:50:34,779 --> 01:50:36,530
 

5233
01:50:34,789 --> 01:50:39,230
 solve for the parameters that set the

5234
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:39,230
 

5235
01:50:36,530 --> 01:50:41,409
 moment condition equal to zero but we're

5236
01:50:39,220 --> 01:50:41,409
 

5237
01:50:39,230 --> 01:50:44,809
 going to weight more heavily than nearby

5238
01:50:41,399 --> 01:50:44,809
 

5239
01:50:41,409 --> 01:50:46,159
 X's and so what do I mean by nearby well

5240
01:50:44,799 --> 01:50:46,159
 

5241
01:50:44,809 --> 01:50:47,929
 I'm going to generate a bunch of trees

5242
01:50:46,149 --> 01:50:47,929
 

5243
01:50:46,159 --> 01:50:49,940
 each tree is going to be a partition of

5244
01:50:47,919 --> 01:50:49,940
 

5245
01:50:47,929 --> 01:50:52,400
 the covariant space and I'm just going

5246
01:50:49,930 --> 01:50:52,400
 

5247
01:50:49,940 --> 01:50:54,559
 to take the frequency of being nearby as

5248
01:50:52,390 --> 01:50:54,559
 

5249
01:50:52,400 --> 01:50:56,599
 the weight that I get in in this

5250
01:50:54,549 --> 01:50:56,599
 

5251
01:50:54,559 --> 01:50:58,369
 weighting function now there's a few

5252
01:50:56,589 --> 01:50:58,369
 

5253
01:50:56,599 --> 01:51:00,289
 more details because in order to get

5254
01:50:58,359 --> 01:51:00,289
 

5255
01:50:58,369 --> 01:51:03,020
 asymptotic normality for this we

5256
01:51:00,279 --> 01:51:03,020
 

5257
01:51:00,289 --> 01:51:06,050
 actually need to use sample splitting so

5258
01:51:03,010 --> 01:51:06,050
 

5259
01:51:03,020 --> 01:51:08,630
 in particular we we use subsampling to

5260
01:51:06,040 --> 01:51:08,630
 

5261
01:51:06,050 --> 01:51:12,560
 create the trees and in fact we use two

5262
01:51:08,620 --> 01:51:12,560
 

5263
01:51:08,630 --> 01:51:14,660
 samples for each for each

5264
01:51:12,550 --> 01:51:14,660
 

5265
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:17,120
 time we create a tree one sample to

5266
01:51:14,650 --> 01:51:17,120
 

5267
01:51:14,660 --> 01:51:20,660
 create the partition and then another to

5268
01:51:17,110 --> 01:51:20,660
 

5269
01:51:17,120 --> 01:51:22,430
 select weights because we're again we're

5270
01:51:20,650 --> 01:51:22,430
 

5271
01:51:20,660 --> 01:51:25,820
 trying to be careful that we don't let

5272
01:51:22,420 --> 01:51:25,820
 

5273
01:51:22,430 --> 01:51:30,800
 an individual's own outcome influence

5274
01:51:25,810 --> 01:51:30,800
 

5275
01:51:25,820 --> 01:51:32,390
 the weights that it receives so in this

5276
01:51:30,790 --> 01:51:32,390
 

5277
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:34,490
 paper we establish asymptotic normality

5278
01:51:32,380 --> 01:51:34,490
 

5279
01:51:32,390 --> 01:51:35,690
 of the parameter estimates and provide

5280
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:35,690
 

5281
01:51:34,490 --> 01:51:37,970
 confidence intervals

5282
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:37,970
 

5283
01:51:35,690 --> 01:51:40,490
 we also recommend orthogonalization and

5284
01:51:37,960 --> 01:51:40,490
 

5285
01:51:37,970 --> 01:51:43,520
 we have some reasonably high performing

5286
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:43,520
 

5287
01:51:40,490 --> 01:51:45,050
 software on crayon and are called

5288
01:51:43,510 --> 01:51:45,050
 

5289
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:46,190
 generalized random forests and if

5290
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:46,190
 

5291
01:51:45,050 --> 01:51:47,750
 there's any students in the audience we

5292
01:51:46,180 --> 01:51:47,750
 

5293
01:51:46,190 --> 01:51:50,990
 have lots of people contributing to this

5294
01:51:47,740 --> 01:51:50,990
 

5295
01:51:47,750 --> 01:51:53,750
 project and we welcome contributors so

5296
01:51:50,980 --> 01:51:53,750
 

5297
01:51:50,990 --> 01:51:57,020
 and in this package we'll do things like

5298
01:51:53,740 --> 01:51:57,020
 

5299
01:51:53,750 --> 01:51:58,570
 quantile regression regular causal

5300
01:51:57,010 --> 01:51:58,570
 

5301
01:51:57,020 --> 01:52:01,130
 inference under unconfoundedness

5302
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:01,130
 

5303
01:51:58,570 --> 01:52:04,070
 randomized experiments instrumental

5304
01:52:01,120 --> 01:52:04,070
 

5305
01:52:01,130 --> 01:52:07,250
 variables it can also deal with with

5306
01:52:04,060 --> 01:52:07,250
 

5307
01:52:04,070 --> 01:52:09,440
 clustering and so on we've also been

5308
01:52:07,240 --> 01:52:09,440
 

5309
01:52:07,250 --> 01:52:11,330
 working on trying to deal with some

5310
01:52:09,430 --> 01:52:11,330
 

5311
01:52:09,440 --> 01:52:12,830
 known weaknesses of random forests and

5312
01:52:11,320 --> 01:52:12,830
 

5313
01:52:11,330 --> 01:52:15,680
 in particular in a lot of the economic

5314
01:52:12,820 --> 01:52:15,680
 

5315
01:52:12,830 --> 01:52:17,720
 applications I look at there's some

5316
01:52:15,670 --> 01:52:17,720
 

5317
01:52:15,680 --> 01:52:20,300
 smooth relationships like you might have

5318
01:52:17,710 --> 01:52:20,300
 

5319
01:52:17,720 --> 01:52:21,860
 your outcomes might be increasing an

5320
01:52:20,290 --> 01:52:21,860
 

5321
01:52:20,300 --> 01:52:23,270
 income or if you think about a tech firm

5322
01:52:21,850 --> 01:52:23,270
 

5323
01:52:21,860 --> 01:52:25,400
 application there's a lot of

5324
01:52:23,260 --> 01:52:25,400
 

5325
01:52:23,270 --> 01:52:27,200
 monotonicity people who are more active

5326
01:52:25,390 --> 01:52:27,200
 

5327
01:52:25,400 --> 01:52:28,490
 or gonna do much more of lots of other

5328
01:52:27,190 --> 01:52:28,490
 

5329
01:52:27,200 --> 01:52:30,770
 things they might also have higher

5330
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:30,770
 

5331
01:52:28,490 --> 01:52:32,750
 treatment effects and so the problem

5332
01:52:30,760 --> 01:52:32,750
 

5333
01:52:30,770 --> 01:52:34,790
 with forests is they make these these

5334
01:52:32,740 --> 01:52:34,790
 

5335
01:52:32,750 --> 01:52:37,430
 kind of rectangles and they wait

5336
01:52:34,780 --> 01:52:37,430
 

5337
01:52:34,790 --> 01:52:38,990
 everybody equally within a rectangle now

5338
01:52:37,420 --> 01:52:38,990
 

5339
01:52:37,430 --> 01:52:40,070
 when we average over the rectangles

5340
01:52:38,980 --> 01:52:40,070
 

5341
01:52:38,990 --> 01:52:41,930
 we're going to get smoother waiting

5342
01:52:40,060 --> 01:52:41,930
 

5343
01:52:40,070 --> 01:52:43,220
 functions but we still aren't really

5344
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:43,220
 

5345
01:52:41,930 --> 01:52:46,150
 accounting for the fact that if

5346
01:52:43,210 --> 01:52:46,150
 

5347
01:52:43,220 --> 01:52:49,280
 someone's on the boundaries of a

5348
01:52:46,140 --> 01:52:49,280
 

5349
01:52:46,150 --> 01:52:50,780
 rectangle then we're then you know they

5350
01:52:49,270 --> 01:52:50,780
 

5351
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:53,600
 might be fairly far from a target

5352
01:52:50,770 --> 01:52:53,600
 

5353
01:52:50,780 --> 01:52:56,090
 observation so together with a student

5354
01:52:53,590 --> 01:52:56,090
 

5355
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:58,430
 of ours Reena Freiburg we wrote a paper

5356
01:52:56,080 --> 01:52:58,430
 

5357
01:52:56,090 --> 01:53:00,140
 called local linear forests and this is

5358
01:52:58,420 --> 01:53:00,140
 

5359
01:52:58,430 --> 01:53:02,390
 motivated again by some work that's been

5360
01:53:00,130 --> 01:53:02,390
 

5361
01:53:00,140 --> 01:53:06,380
 done in the statistics literature where

5362
01:53:02,380 --> 01:53:06,380
 

5363
01:53:02,390 --> 01:53:09,410
 what we do is we we adjust for being

5364
01:53:06,370 --> 01:53:09,410
 

5365
01:53:06,380 --> 01:53:11,840
 being observations within a leaf being

5366
01:53:09,400 --> 01:53:11,840
 

5367
01:53:09,410 --> 01:53:14,390
 far away another way to think about it

5368
01:53:11,830 --> 01:53:14,390
 

5369
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:17,240
 as we run a local linear regression at

5370
01:53:14,380 --> 01:53:17,240
 

5371
01:53:14,390 --> 01:53:20,630
 each point waiting using the random for

5372
01:53:17,230 --> 01:53:20,630
 

5373
01:53:17,240 --> 01:53:23,660
 dissuading kernels and so we we see that

5374
01:53:20,620 --> 01:53:23,660
 

5375
01:53:20,630 --> 01:53:24,540
 we're a regular random forest would fit

5376
01:53:23,650 --> 01:53:24,540
 

5377
01:53:23,660 --> 01:53:26,820
 a step function

5378
01:53:24,530 --> 01:53:26,820
 

5379
01:53:24,540 --> 01:53:29,820
 and have a hard time estimating a steep

5380
01:53:26,810 --> 01:53:29,820
 

5381
01:53:26,820 --> 01:53:32,490
 slope in a small data set by using these

5382
01:53:29,810 --> 01:53:32,490
 

5383
01:53:29,820 --> 01:53:35,520
 these local linear justments we get much

5384
01:53:32,480 --> 01:53:35,520
 

5385
01:53:32,490 --> 01:53:37,590
 smoother effects so we apply this to

5386
01:53:35,510 --> 01:53:37,590
 

5387
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:39,990
 causal imprints we looked at this

5388
01:53:37,580 --> 01:53:39,990
 

5389
01:53:37,590 --> 01:53:41,880
 randomized survey experiment where there

5390
01:53:39,980 --> 01:53:41,880
 

5391
01:53:39,990 --> 01:53:43,920
 was done by the by the government the

5392
01:53:41,870 --> 01:53:43,920
 

5393
01:53:41,880 --> 01:53:46,500
 big social survey that's done every year

5394
01:53:43,910 --> 01:53:46,500
 

5395
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:48,240
 and for a period of years they

5396
01:53:46,490 --> 01:53:48,240
 

5397
01:53:46,500 --> 01:53:48,900
 randomized asking people one of two

5398
01:53:48,230 --> 01:53:48,900
 

5399
01:53:48,240 --> 01:53:50,490
 questions

5400
01:53:48,890 --> 01:53:50,490
 

5401
01:53:48,900 --> 01:53:51,990
 some people were asked whether they

5402
01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:51,990
 

5403
01:53:50,490 --> 01:53:54,030
 wanted to provide assistance to the poor

5404
01:53:51,980 --> 01:53:54,030
 

5405
01:53:51,990 --> 01:53:56,520
 while other people were asked whether

5406
01:53:54,020 --> 01:53:56,520
 

5407
01:53:54,030 --> 01:53:59,190
 they liked welfare now those are the

5408
01:53:56,510 --> 01:53:59,190
 

5409
01:53:56,520 --> 01:54:00,870
 actually the same thing but people in

5410
01:53:59,180 --> 01:54:00,870
 

5411
01:53:59,190 --> 01:54:02,790
 the u.s. don't like the world welfare

5412
01:54:00,860 --> 01:54:02,790
 

5413
01:54:00,870 --> 01:54:06,600
 it's been poorly branded by

5414
01:54:02,780 --> 01:54:06,600
 

5415
01:54:02,790 --> 01:54:07,980
 conservatives so if you look here we see

5416
01:54:06,590 --> 01:54:07,980
 

5417
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:10,020
 that the treatment effect is actually

5418
01:54:07,970 --> 01:54:10,020
 

5419
01:54:07,980 --> 01:54:12,210
 much higher for conservatives than

5420
01:54:10,010 --> 01:54:12,210
 

5421
01:54:10,020 --> 01:54:15,150
 liberals and for rich people than for

5422
01:54:12,200 --> 01:54:15,150
 

5423
01:54:12,210 --> 01:54:17,130
 poor people but the normal causal forest

5424
01:54:15,140 --> 01:54:17,130
 

5425
01:54:15,150 --> 01:54:19,290
 kind of flattens things out near the

5426
01:54:17,120 --> 01:54:19,290
 

5427
01:54:17,130 --> 01:54:24,380
 boundaries while the local linear forest

5428
01:54:19,280 --> 01:54:24,380
 

5429
01:54:19,290 --> 01:54:27,900
 makes things smooth so let me know skip

5430
01:54:24,370 --> 01:54:27,900
 

5431
01:54:24,380 --> 01:54:31,260
 to the last part I want to talk a little

5432
01:54:27,890 --> 01:54:31,260
 

5433
01:54:27,900 --> 01:54:33,360
 bit about structural models and discrete

5434
01:54:31,250 --> 01:54:33,360
 

5435
01:54:31,260 --> 01:54:34,710
 choice models in particular this is an

5436
01:54:33,350 --> 01:54:34,710
 

5437
01:54:33,360 --> 01:54:36,690
 app this is an area where I've been

5438
01:54:34,700 --> 01:54:36,690
 

5439
01:54:34,710 --> 01:54:38,610
 working together with David Blythe to

5440
01:54:36,680 --> 01:54:38,610
 

5441
01:54:36,690 --> 01:54:40,500
 try to put together some modern machine

5442
01:54:38,600 --> 01:54:40,500
 

5443
01:54:38,610 --> 01:54:42,420
 learning methods from Bayesian inference

5444
01:54:40,490 --> 01:54:42,420
 

5445
01:54:40,500 --> 01:54:45,150
 variational inference with traditional

5446
01:54:42,410 --> 01:54:45,150
 

5447
01:54:42,420 --> 01:54:47,820
 econometrics structural estimation so

5448
01:54:45,140 --> 01:54:47,820
 

5449
01:54:45,150 --> 01:54:50,640
 this is a problem of a firm trying to

5450
01:54:47,810 --> 01:54:50,640
 

5451
01:54:47,820 --> 01:54:53,190
 estimate the impact of changing prices

5452
01:54:50,630 --> 01:54:53,190
 

5453
01:54:50,640 --> 01:54:55,410
 and so the way that these have been

5454
01:54:53,180 --> 01:54:55,410
 

5455
01:54:53,190 --> 01:54:57,780
 modeled and this actually Dan McFadden

5456
01:54:55,400 --> 01:54:57,780
 

5457
01:54:55,410 --> 01:55:00,210
 worked on these models in the early

5458
01:54:57,770 --> 01:55:00,210
 

5459
01:54:57,780 --> 01:55:02,400
 1970s and won the Nobel Prize for this

5460
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:02,400
 

5461
01:55:00,210 --> 01:55:06,000
 more than 10 years ago maybe 15 years

5462
01:55:02,390 --> 01:55:06,000
 

5463
01:55:02,400 --> 01:55:08,460
 ago for this work and he was actually

5464
01:55:05,990 --> 01:55:08,460
 

5465
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:09,780
 motivated by transportation problem so

5466
01:55:08,450 --> 01:55:09,780
 

5467
01:55:08,460 --> 01:55:11,490
 he was trying to say counterfactually

5468
01:55:09,770 --> 01:55:11,490
 

5469
01:55:09,780 --> 01:55:13,350
 what would happen if they expanded the

5470
01:55:11,480 --> 01:55:13,350
 

5471
01:55:11,490 --> 01:55:15,450
 the public transportation and in San

5472
01:55:13,340 --> 01:55:15,450
 

5473
01:55:13,350 --> 01:55:17,940
 Francisco and so he really needed to

5474
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:17,940
 

5475
01:55:15,450 --> 01:55:19,770
 understand the welfare and use revealed

5476
01:55:17,930 --> 01:55:19,770
 

5477
01:55:17,940 --> 01:55:21,300
 preference to understand that I'm

5478
01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:21,300
 

5479
01:55:19,770 --> 01:55:23,010
 applying this type of model to

5480
01:55:21,290 --> 01:55:23,010
 

5481
01:55:21,300 --> 01:55:24,660
 supermarket which is a very common

5482
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:24,660
 

5483
01:55:23,010 --> 01:55:26,220
 application in economics and marketing

5484
01:55:24,650 --> 01:55:26,220
 

5485
01:55:24,660 --> 01:55:28,620
 where I have scanner data from

5486
01:55:26,210 --> 01:55:28,620
 

5487
01:55:26,220 --> 01:55:30,000
 supermarkets so what we do is we model

5488
01:55:28,610 --> 01:55:30,000
 

5489
01:55:28,620 --> 01:55:32,520
 first that each person has a mean

5490
01:55:29,990 --> 01:55:32,520
 

5491
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:34,590
 utility so user you with product I and

5492
01:55:32,510 --> 01:55:34,590
 

5493
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:37,000
 time T has a mean utility for a product

5494
01:55:34,580 --> 01:55:37,000
 

5495
01:55:34,590 --> 01:55:38,200
 it might depend on the care

5496
01:55:36,990 --> 01:55:38,200
 

5497
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:40,900
 the observed characteristics of the

5498
01:55:38,190 --> 01:55:40,900
 

5499
01:55:38,200 --> 01:55:43,030
 products and its decreasing in price so

5500
01:55:40,890 --> 01:55:43,030
 

5501
01:55:40,900 --> 01:55:45,790
 the higher price the less I like the

5502
01:55:43,020 --> 01:55:45,790
 

5503
01:55:43,030 --> 01:55:48,340
 thing and then I'm going to say that my

5504
01:55:45,780 --> 01:55:48,340
 

5505
01:55:45,790 --> 01:55:50,590
 utility is equal to my main utility plus

5506
01:55:48,330 --> 01:55:50,590
 

5507
01:55:48,340 --> 01:55:52,870
 some idiosyncratic error and it turns

5508
01:55:50,580 --> 01:55:52,870
 

5509
01:55:50,590 --> 01:55:54,600
 out if that's an extreme value error if

5510
01:55:52,860 --> 01:55:54,600
 

5511
01:55:52,870 --> 01:55:57,670
 has a particular logit functional form

5512
01:55:54,590 --> 01:55:57,670
 

5513
01:55:54,600 --> 01:56:00,760
 then we can write the probability of you

5514
01:55:57,660 --> 01:56:00,760
 

5515
01:55:57,670 --> 01:56:03,550
 buying of the the user you buys item I

5516
01:56:00,750 --> 01:56:03,550
 

5517
01:56:00,760 --> 01:56:06,430
 at time T in this pretty multinomial

5518
01:56:03,540 --> 01:56:06,430
 

5519
01:56:03,550 --> 01:56:08,950
 logit format it's just e to the mean

5520
01:56:06,420 --> 01:56:08,950
 

5521
01:56:06,430 --> 01:56:11,140
 utility of the item divided by the sum

5522
01:56:08,940 --> 01:56:11,140
 

5523
01:56:08,950 --> 01:56:13,450
 of e to the mean utilities of all the

5524
01:56:11,130 --> 01:56:13,450
 

5525
01:56:11,140 --> 01:56:16,140
 items and so sort of part of the Nobel

5526
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:16,140
 

5527
01:56:13,450 --> 01:56:18,190
 prize-winning work was relating this

5528
01:56:16,130 --> 01:56:18,190
 

5529
01:56:16,140 --> 01:56:20,770
 statistical model of lots of people run

5530
01:56:18,180 --> 01:56:20,770
 

5531
01:56:18,190 --> 01:56:23,140
 multinomial logit s' right but relating

5532
01:56:20,760 --> 01:56:23,140
 

5533
01:56:20,770 --> 01:56:25,210
 the multinomial logit to a user utility

5534
01:56:23,130 --> 01:56:25,210
 

5535
01:56:23,140 --> 01:56:27,070
 model and then he also did more work

5536
01:56:25,200 --> 01:56:27,070
 

5537
01:56:25,210 --> 01:56:29,170
 looking at some of the unpleasant

5538
01:56:27,060 --> 01:56:29,170
 

5539
01:56:27,070 --> 01:56:31,720
 assumptions that come out of just having

5540
01:56:29,160 --> 01:56:31,720
 

5541
01:56:29,170 --> 01:56:33,700
 the simple model and did various

5542
01:56:31,710 --> 01:56:33,700
 

5543
01:56:31,720 --> 01:56:36,940
 generalizations that made it look more

5544
01:56:33,690 --> 01:56:36,940
 

5545
01:56:33,700 --> 01:56:39,430
 realistic now if you if you just have a

5546
01:56:36,930 --> 01:56:39,430
 

5547
01:56:36,940 --> 01:56:41,620
 cross section you can kind of figure out

5548
01:56:39,420 --> 01:56:41,620
 

5549
01:56:39,430 --> 01:56:44,200
 something about overall price

5550
01:56:41,610 --> 01:56:44,200
 

5551
01:56:41,620 --> 01:56:45,520
 sensitivity but if you have a panel of

5552
01:56:44,190 --> 01:56:45,520
 

5553
01:56:44,200 --> 01:56:48,430
 people where you see there say they're

5554
01:56:45,510 --> 01:56:48,430
 

5555
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:50,410
 shopping data over time at the store you

5556
01:56:48,420 --> 01:56:50,410
 

5557
01:56:48,430 --> 01:56:52,240
 can actually learn an estimate for each

5558
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:52,240
 

5559
01:56:50,410 --> 01:56:54,280
 person of their price sensitivity as

5560
01:56:52,230 --> 01:56:54,280
 

5561
01:56:52,240 --> 01:56:57,100
 long as the prices are changing over

5562
01:56:54,270 --> 01:56:57,100
 

5563
01:56:54,280 --> 01:56:58,780
 time and so that's what I do in a series

5564
01:56:57,090 --> 01:56:58,780
 

5565
01:56:57,100 --> 01:57:01,030
 of papers I have some on shopping data

5566
01:56:58,770 --> 01:57:01,030
 

5567
01:56:58,780 --> 01:57:05,110
 and we also have some using mobile

5568
01:57:01,020 --> 01:57:05,110
 

5569
01:57:01,030 --> 01:57:07,030
 location data for people going to lunch

5570
01:57:05,100 --> 01:57:07,030
 

5571
01:57:05,110 --> 01:57:09,460
 so we have a large data set where we

5572
01:57:07,020 --> 01:57:09,460
 

5573
01:57:07,030 --> 01:57:11,740
 observe people with mobile phones where

5574
01:57:09,450 --> 01:57:11,740
 

5575
01:57:09,460 --> 01:57:13,060
 they are during the day and we see where

5576
01:57:11,730 --> 01:57:13,060
 

5577
01:57:11,740 --> 01:57:15,190
 they work as well as where they go to

5578
01:57:13,050 --> 01:57:15,190
 

5579
01:57:13,060 --> 01:57:17,770
 lunch and for each of these we do a

5580
01:57:15,180 --> 01:57:17,770
 

5581
01:57:15,190 --> 01:57:19,840
 couple of things we first bring in to

5582
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:19,840
 

5583
01:57:17,770 --> 01:57:21,940
 this very simple model matrix

5584
01:57:19,830 --> 01:57:21,940
 

5585
01:57:19,840 --> 01:57:23,320
 factorization so we look at lots of

5586
01:57:21,930 --> 01:57:23,320
 

5587
01:57:21,940 --> 01:57:25,540
 products and instead of trying to

5588
01:57:23,310 --> 01:57:25,540
 

5589
01:57:23,320 --> 01:57:27,970
 estimate you know for each product what

5590
01:57:25,530 --> 01:57:27,970
 

5591
01:57:25,540 --> 01:57:30,370
 its utility is we actually use matrix

5592
01:57:27,960 --> 01:57:30,370
 

5593
01:57:27,970 --> 01:57:31,000
 factorization techniques to improve

5594
01:57:30,360 --> 01:57:31,000
 

5595
01:57:30,370 --> 01:57:33,760
 efficiency

5596
01:57:30,990 --> 01:57:33,760
 

5597
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:35,230
 we also are you going to be a much we're

5598
01:57:33,750 --> 01:57:35,230
 

5599
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:37,090
 going to use modern computational

5600
01:57:35,220 --> 01:57:37,090
 

5601
01:57:35,230 --> 01:57:39,790
 techniques so historically marketing

5602
01:57:37,080 --> 01:57:39,790
 

5603
01:57:37,090 --> 01:57:41,380
 people used Markov chain Monte Carlo but

5604
01:57:39,780 --> 01:57:41,380
 

5605
01:57:39,790 --> 01:57:44,770
 that didn't scale very well and so we're

5606
01:57:41,370 --> 01:57:44,770
 

5607
01:57:41,380 --> 01:57:48,700
 gonna use variational inference and then

5608
01:57:44,760 --> 01:57:48,700
 

5609
01:57:44,770 --> 01:57:51,520
 we're also going to do some things to

5610
01:57:48,690 --> 01:57:51,520
 

5611
01:57:48,700 --> 01:57:53,890
 you like for the case where we use data

5612
01:57:51,510 --> 01:57:53,890
 

5613
01:57:51,520 --> 01:57:56,080
 about the product hierarchy we're going

5614
01:57:53,880 --> 01:57:56,080
 

5615
01:57:53,890 --> 01:57:57,550
 to to study products where people only

5616
01:57:56,070 --> 01:57:57,550
 

5617
01:57:56,080 --> 01:58:00,310
 choose one of them and so we're going to

5618
01:57:57,540 --> 01:58:00,310
 

5619
01:57:57,550 --> 01:58:02,410
 use that fact in our estimation so in

5620
01:58:00,300 --> 01:58:02,410
 

5621
01:58:00,310 --> 01:58:05,010
 our model our main utility instead of

5622
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:05,010
 

5623
01:58:02,410 --> 01:58:07,750
 having kind of just fixed coefficients

5624
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,750
 

5625
01:58:05,010 --> 01:58:09,370
 we're gonna have a factorize main

5626
01:58:07,740 --> 01:58:09,370
 

5627
01:58:07,750 --> 01:58:11,290
 utility that's going to be latent and

5628
01:58:09,360 --> 01:58:11,290
 

5629
01:58:09,370 --> 01:58:13,300
 we're gonna try to learn a latent

5630
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:13,300
 

5631
01:58:11,290 --> 01:58:14,800
 factorization of the mean utility and

5632
01:58:13,290 --> 01:58:14,800
 

5633
01:58:13,300 --> 01:58:17,470
 we're also going to try to learn a

5634
01:58:14,790 --> 01:58:17,470
 

5635
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:19,690
 latent factorization for the price

5636
01:58:17,460 --> 01:58:19,690
 

5637
01:58:17,470 --> 01:58:21,550
 sensitivity so each user will be

5638
01:58:19,680 --> 01:58:21,550
 

5639
01:58:19,690 --> 01:58:23,350
 characterized by a vector of mean

5640
01:58:21,540 --> 01:58:23,350
 

5641
01:58:21,550 --> 01:58:26,290
 preference parameters as well as a

5642
01:58:23,340 --> 01:58:26,290
 

5643
01:58:23,350 --> 01:58:28,750
 vector of price parameters and then each

5644
01:58:26,280 --> 01:58:28,750
 

5645
01:58:26,290 --> 01:58:31,000
 product will be characterized also by a

5646
01:58:28,740 --> 01:58:31,000
 

5647
01:58:28,750 --> 01:58:32,890
 vector of parameters so we'll learn that

5648
01:58:30,990 --> 01:58:32,890
 

5649
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:34,540
 lettuce is like tomatoes and if you're

5650
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:34,540
 

5651
01:58:32,890 --> 01:58:35,860
 sensitive to price sensitive for

5652
01:58:34,530 --> 01:58:35,860
 

5653
01:58:34,540 --> 01:58:37,090
 tomatoes you might also be price

5654
01:58:35,850 --> 01:58:37,090
 

5655
01:58:35,860 --> 01:58:39,040
 sensitive for lettuce and we're gonna

5656
01:58:37,080 --> 01:58:39,040
 

5657
01:58:37,090 --> 01:58:41,200
 learn that from the data but we're gonna

5658
01:58:39,030 --> 01:58:41,200
 

5659
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:43,540
 have this nice functional form and this

5660
01:58:41,190 --> 01:58:43,540
 

5661
01:58:41,200 --> 01:58:45,430
 functional form this this multinomial

5662
01:58:43,530 --> 01:58:45,430
 

5663
01:58:43,540 --> 01:58:47,620
 logit functional form has the property

5664
01:58:45,420 --> 01:58:47,620
 

5665
01:58:45,430 --> 01:58:49,420
 that it's gonna tell us like if i pull

5666
01:58:47,610 --> 01:58:49,420
 

5667
01:58:47,620 --> 01:58:51,430
 one of the items out like if i pull out

5668
01:58:49,410 --> 01:58:51,430
 

5669
01:58:49,420 --> 01:58:53,440
 your most popular item it's going to

5670
01:58:51,420 --> 01:58:53,440
 

5671
01:58:51,430 --> 01:58:56,170
 tell us how you substitute two other

5672
01:58:53,430 --> 01:58:56,170
 

5673
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:59,350
 products and so the model will actually

5674
01:58:56,160 --> 01:58:59,350
 

5675
01:58:56,170 --> 01:59:01,510
 tell you the the consequences of raising

5676
01:58:59,340 --> 01:59:01,510
 

5677
01:58:59,350 --> 01:59:03,490
 a price of one product on the demand for

5678
01:59:01,500 --> 01:59:03,490
 

5679
01:59:01,510 --> 01:59:05,710
 all of the other products and that

5680
01:59:03,480 --> 01:59:05,710
 

5681
01:59:03,490 --> 01:59:08,440
 functional form turns out to work very

5682
01:59:05,700 --> 01:59:08,440
 

5683
01:59:05,710 --> 01:59:10,360
 well in practice now one of the

5684
01:59:08,430 --> 01:59:10,360
 

5685
01:59:08,440 --> 01:59:11,920
 modifications we needed to do was to

5686
01:59:10,350 --> 01:59:11,920
 

5687
01:59:10,360 --> 01:59:13,180
 model just whether you choose the

5688
01:59:11,910 --> 01:59:13,180
 

5689
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:14,920
 product at all because I'm most shopping

5690
01:59:13,170 --> 01:59:14,920
 

5691
01:59:13,180 --> 01:59:17,110
 trips you just don't buy paper towels at

5692
01:59:14,910 --> 01:59:17,110
 

5693
01:59:14,920 --> 01:59:18,580
 all and this is called nested logit that

5694
01:59:17,100 --> 01:59:18,580
 

5695
01:59:17,110 --> 01:59:20,590
 was one of the things dan McFadden got

5696
01:59:18,570 --> 01:59:20,590
 

5697
01:59:18,580 --> 01:59:22,780
 his Nobel Prize for and so now we have a

5698
01:59:20,580 --> 01:59:22,780
 

5699
01:59:20,590 --> 01:59:25,300
 factorization version of the nested

5700
01:59:22,770 --> 01:59:25,300
 

5701
01:59:22,780 --> 01:59:28,570
 logit where we also factorize the

5702
01:59:25,290 --> 01:59:28,570
 

5703
01:59:25,300 --> 01:59:30,700
 probability of not buying an item at all

5704
01:59:28,560 --> 01:59:30,700
 

5705
01:59:28,570 --> 01:59:33,070
 and there's this nice algebra that shows

5706
01:59:30,690 --> 01:59:33,070
 

5707
01:59:30,700 --> 01:59:36,760
 how you relate all of these things and

5708
01:59:33,060 --> 01:59:36,760
 

5709
01:59:33,070 --> 01:59:39,010
 and it simplifies the computation so I

5710
01:59:36,750 --> 01:59:39,010
 

5711
01:59:36,760 --> 01:59:41,050
 just want to kind of close off with two

5712
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,050
 

5713
01:59:39,010 --> 01:59:43,420
 kind of interesting things that come out

5714
01:59:41,040 --> 01:59:43,420
 

5715
01:59:41,050 --> 01:59:45,370
 of this first of all one of the things

5716
01:59:43,410 --> 01:59:45,370
 

5717
01:59:43,420 --> 01:59:47,230
 that we did differently in this paper is

5718
01:59:45,360 --> 01:59:47,230
 

5719
01:59:45,370 --> 01:59:49,600
 that we had because we had lots and lots

5720
01:59:47,220 --> 01:59:49,600
 

5721
01:59:47,230 --> 01:59:51,700
 of price changes in the data we actually

5722
01:59:49,590 --> 01:59:51,700
 

5723
01:59:49,600 --> 01:59:54,070
 tuned our model for the counterfactual

5724
01:59:51,690 --> 01:59:54,070
 

5725
01:59:51,700 --> 01:59:55,660
 so in particular instead of just looking

5726
01:59:54,060 --> 01:59:55,660
 

5727
01:59:54,070 --> 01:59:58,390
 tuning for the log-likelihood of

5728
01:59:55,650 --> 01:59:58,390
 

5729
01:59:55,660 --> 02:00:00,240
 goodness of fit overall we instead tuned

5730
01:59:58,380 --> 02:00:00,240
 

5731
01:59:58,390 --> 02:00:02,370
 for we held it

5732
02:00:00,230 --> 02:00:02,370
 

5733
02:00:00,240 --> 02:00:05,370
 held-out data set of weeks that had

5734
02:00:02,360 --> 02:00:05,370
 

5735
02:00:02,370 --> 02:00:07,380
 price changes and then we selected the

5736
02:00:05,360 --> 02:00:07,380
 

5737
02:00:05,370 --> 02:00:09,750
 model that did the best at predicting

5738
02:00:07,370 --> 02:00:09,750
 

5739
02:00:07,380 --> 02:00:13,080
 the change in purchased probabilities

5740
02:00:09,740 --> 02:00:13,080
 

5741
02:00:09,750 --> 02:00:14,880
 from price changes rather than the ones

5742
02:00:13,070 --> 02:00:14,880
 

5743
02:00:13,080 --> 02:00:16,020
 that predicted best on average and it

5744
02:00:14,870 --> 02:00:16,020
 

5745
02:00:14,880 --> 02:00:19,710
 turned out that those were different

5746
02:00:16,010 --> 02:00:19,710
 

5747
02:00:16,020 --> 02:00:21,270
 models and that's important and so what

5748
02:00:19,700 --> 02:00:21,270
 

5749
02:00:19,710 --> 02:00:23,490
 we did this is just one of our

5750
02:00:21,260 --> 02:00:23,490
 

5751
02:00:21,270 --> 02:00:25,680
 goodness-of-fit tables we looked at what

5752
02:00:23,480 --> 02:00:25,680
 

5753
02:00:23,490 --> 02:00:27,720
 happens in a week where another product

5754
02:00:25,670 --> 02:00:27,720
 

5755
02:00:25,680 --> 02:00:29,850
 in the category changed prices so like

5756
02:00:27,710 --> 02:00:29,850
 

5757
02:00:27,720 --> 02:00:31,980
 if one brand of bottled water increased

5758
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:31,980
 

5759
02:00:29,850 --> 02:00:33,600
 its price we looked at the goodness of

5760
02:00:31,970 --> 02:00:33,600
 

5761
02:00:31,980 --> 02:00:36,090
 fit of predicting what happens to the

5762
02:00:33,590 --> 02:00:36,090
 

5763
02:00:33,600 --> 02:00:37,890
 other brands of bottled water we also do

5764
02:00:36,080 --> 02:00:37,890
 

5765
02:00:36,090 --> 02:00:40,230
 the same thing for out of stock and own

5766
02:00:37,880 --> 02:00:40,230
 

5767
02:00:37,890 --> 02:00:42,240
 price changes as well and so we find

5768
02:00:40,220 --> 02:00:42,240
 

5769
02:00:40,230 --> 02:00:43,710
 that our model of course I'm showing you

5770
02:00:42,230 --> 02:00:43,710
 

5771
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:46,440
 the picture so of course our model does

5772
02:00:43,700 --> 02:00:46,440
 

5773
02:00:43,710 --> 02:00:48,210
 best and we compare it both to

5774
02:00:46,430 --> 02:00:48,210
 

5775
02:00:46,440 --> 02:00:51,780
 traditional economics and marketing

5776
02:00:48,200 --> 02:00:51,780
 

5777
02:00:48,210 --> 02:00:53,640
 models as well as to what happens if we

5778
02:00:51,770 --> 02:00:53,640
 

5779
02:00:51,780 --> 02:00:55,470
 take a reduced form machine learning

5780
02:00:53,630 --> 02:00:55,470
 

5781
02:00:53,640 --> 02:00:57,720
 model we just throw a big factorization

5782
02:00:55,460 --> 02:00:57,720
 

5783
02:00:55,470 --> 02:01:00,180
 at things take the parameters out and

5784
02:00:57,710 --> 02:01:00,180
 

5785
02:00:57,720 --> 02:01:03,210
 stick them into an economics model and

5786
02:01:00,170 --> 02:01:03,210
 

5787
02:01:00,180 --> 02:01:05,550
 it turns out that taking a big machine

5788
02:01:03,200 --> 02:01:05,550
 

5789
02:01:03,210 --> 02:01:07,140
 learning model just getting reduced form

5790
02:01:05,540 --> 02:01:07,140
 

5791
02:01:05,550 --> 02:01:08,850
 predictions that don't use any structure

5792
02:01:07,130 --> 02:01:08,850
 

5793
02:01:07,140 --> 02:01:11,400
 and sticking those predictions as

5794
02:01:08,840 --> 02:01:11,400
 

5795
02:01:08,850 --> 02:01:13,260
 covariates into classic economic and

5796
02:01:11,390 --> 02:01:13,260
 

5797
02:01:11,400 --> 02:01:15,660
 marketing models does a lot better than

5798
02:01:13,250 --> 02:01:15,660
 

5799
02:01:13,260 --> 02:01:17,940
 not doing it so if you were trying to

5800
02:01:15,650 --> 02:01:17,940
 

5801
02:01:15,660 --> 02:01:20,820
 scale to a large tech company that might

5802
02:01:17,930 --> 02:01:20,820
 

5803
02:01:17,940 --> 02:01:22,730
 be a good a good intermediate solution

5804
02:01:20,810 --> 02:01:22,730
 

5805
02:01:20,820 --> 02:01:24,870
 relative to ours which is more

5806
02:01:22,720 --> 02:01:24,870
 

5807
02:01:22,730 --> 02:01:26,730
 computationally expensive and then the

5808
02:01:24,860 --> 02:01:26,730
 

5809
02:01:24,870 --> 02:01:28,890
 last thing I want to show is just what

5810
02:01:26,720 --> 02:01:28,890
 

5811
02:01:26,730 --> 02:01:31,620
 you can do in terms of what if you have

5812
02:01:28,880 --> 02:01:31,620
 

5813
02:01:28,890 --> 02:01:32,820
 this counterfactual model so you we're

5814
02:01:31,610 --> 02:01:32,820
 

5815
02:01:31,620 --> 02:01:34,950
 gonna this counterfactual is about

5816
02:01:32,810 --> 02:01:34,950
 

5817
02:01:32,820 --> 02:01:36,600
 personalized pricing so once I have

5818
02:01:34,940 --> 02:01:36,600
 

5819
02:01:34,950 --> 02:01:38,640
 estimated every individuals price

5820
02:01:36,590 --> 02:01:38,640
 

5821
02:01:36,600 --> 02:01:40,350
 sensitivity I'm gonna say some people

5822
02:01:38,630 --> 02:01:40,350
 

5823
02:01:38,640 --> 02:01:42,030
 are more price sensitive than others to

5824
02:01:40,340 --> 02:01:42,030
 

5825
02:01:40,350 --> 02:01:43,710
 a particular product and those will vary

5826
02:01:42,020 --> 02:01:43,710
 

5827
02:01:42,030 --> 02:01:46,140
 across products so I can do a

5828
02:01:43,700 --> 02:01:46,140
 

5829
02:01:43,710 --> 02:01:48,720
 counterfactual where I imagine targeting

5830
02:01:46,130 --> 02:01:48,720
 

5831
02:01:46,140 --> 02:01:51,390
 a certain set of people with coupons and

5832
02:01:48,710 --> 02:01:51,390
 

5833
02:01:48,720 --> 02:01:53,580
 we compare the performance of our model

5834
02:01:51,380 --> 02:01:53,580
 

5835
02:01:51,390 --> 02:01:56,040
 with other models in terms of how much

5836
02:01:53,570 --> 02:01:56,040
 

5837
02:01:53,580 --> 02:01:58,500
 personalization helps and by using this

5838
02:01:56,030 --> 02:01:58,500
 

5839
02:01:56,040 --> 02:01:59,940
 rich factorization model relative to

5840
02:01:58,490 --> 02:01:59,940
 

5841
02:01:58,500 --> 02:02:01,410
 what the traditional economics and

5842
02:01:59,930 --> 02:02:01,410
 

5843
02:01:59,940 --> 02:02:04,110
 marketing models we get much more

5844
02:02:01,400 --> 02:02:04,110
 

5845
02:02:01,410 --> 02:02:05,550
 personalized estimates and therefore we

5846
02:02:04,100 --> 02:02:05,550
 

5847
02:02:04,110 --> 02:02:08,370
 can get a lot more benefits from

5848
02:02:05,540 --> 02:02:08,370
 

5849
02:02:05,550 --> 02:02:11,640
 personalization and in our paper we also

5850
02:02:08,360 --> 02:02:11,640
 

5851
02:02:08,370 --> 02:02:13,170
 go through and and show we validate

5852
02:02:11,630 --> 02:02:13,170
 

5853
02:02:11,640 --> 02:02:15,330
 those things by looking at held out data

5854
02:02:13,160 --> 02:02:15,330
 

5855
02:02:13,170 --> 02:02:16,920
 and show that indeed we are the people

5856
02:02:15,320 --> 02:02:16,920
 

5857
02:02:15,330 --> 02:02:19,290
 that we think are most price sensitive

5858
02:02:16,910 --> 02:02:19,290
 

5859
02:02:16,920 --> 02:02:20,580
 tend to be more profitable on days where

5860
02:02:19,280 --> 02:02:20,580
 

5861
02:02:19,290 --> 02:02:24,090
 they get prices that are more

5862
02:02:20,570 --> 02:02:24,090
 

5863
02:02:20,580 --> 02:02:27,440
 appropriate to them so I will stop here

5864
02:02:24,080 --> 02:02:27,440
 

5865
02:02:24,090 --> 02:02:35,410
 and take questions so thanks very much

5866
02:02:27,430 --> 02:02:35,410
 

5867
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:37,460
[Applause]

5868
02:02:35,400 --> 02:02:37,460
 

5869
02:02:35,410 --> 02:02:40,490
 yes ooh if anybody has questions please

5870
02:02:37,450 --> 02:02:40,490
 

5871
02:02:37,460 --> 02:02:42,490
 come up to the microphone what people

5872
02:02:40,480 --> 02:02:42,490
 

5873
02:02:40,490 --> 02:02:45,920
 are coming up with questions I'll just

5874
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:45,920
 

5875
02:02:42,490 --> 02:02:47,420
 say I'm gonna make my slides available I

5876
02:02:45,910 --> 02:02:47,420
 

5877
02:02:45,920 --> 02:02:48,860
 think actually the easiest place I'm not

5878
02:02:47,410 --> 02:02:48,860
 

5879
02:02:47,420 --> 02:02:52,250
 sure I can get them on my website by

5880
02:02:48,850 --> 02:02:52,250
 

5881
02:02:48,860 --> 02:02:53,600
 tomorrow but if you google Susan Athey a

5882
02:02:52,240 --> 02:02:53,600
 

5883
02:02:52,250 --> 02:02:55,130
 AEA machine learning

5884
02:02:53,590 --> 02:02:55,130
 

5885
02:02:53,600 --> 02:02:56,930
 that's a EAS the American Economic

5886
02:02:55,120 --> 02:02:56,930
 

5887
02:02:55,130 --> 02:02:58,280
 Association I have a little Drive there

5888
02:02:56,920 --> 02:02:58,280
 

5889
02:02:56,930 --> 02:03:00,080
 where I keep all my lecture notes

5890
02:02:58,270 --> 02:03:00,080
 

5891
02:02:58,280 --> 02:03:01,490
 updated so you can find a link to the

5892
02:03:00,070 --> 02:03:01,490
 

5893
02:03:00,080 --> 02:03:04,790
 Google Drive and I'll put them there for

5894
02:03:01,480 --> 02:03:04,790
 

5895
02:03:01,490 --> 02:03:07,370
 tomorrow yeah question hi thanks for the

5896
02:03:04,780 --> 02:03:07,370
 

5897
02:03:04,790 --> 02:03:09,980
 talk so this is kind of just a practical

5898
02:03:07,360 --> 02:03:09,980
 

5899
02:03:07,370 --> 02:03:12,340
 question for like Internet companies why

5900
02:03:09,970 --> 02:03:12,340
 

5901
02:03:09,980 --> 02:03:14,960
 can't they just know the propensity of

5902
02:03:12,330 --> 02:03:14,960
 

5903
02:03:12,340 --> 02:03:16,730
 the treatment like they're the ones

5904
02:03:14,950 --> 02:03:16,730
 

5905
02:03:14,960 --> 02:03:19,070
 making that decision seems like it's

5906
02:03:16,720 --> 02:03:19,070
 

5907
02:03:16,730 --> 02:03:20,510
 easy to just have a model that outputs a

5908
02:03:19,060 --> 02:03:20,510
 

5909
02:03:19,070 --> 02:03:22,100
 probability of the treatment and then

5910
02:03:20,500 --> 02:03:22,100
 

5911
02:03:20,510 --> 02:03:24,200
 record the probability along with the

5912
02:03:22,090 --> 02:03:24,200
 

5913
02:03:22,100 --> 02:03:25,580
 treatment yeah so the question was why

5914
02:03:24,190 --> 02:03:25,580
 

5915
02:03:24,200 --> 02:03:27,620
 don't the tech firms just keep the

5916
02:03:25,570 --> 02:03:27,620
 

5917
02:03:25,580 --> 02:03:29,180
 propensity well so the causal of

5918
02:03:27,610 --> 02:03:29,180
 

5919
02:03:27,620 --> 02:03:32,120
 inference folks lobby for that quite

5920
02:03:29,170 --> 02:03:32,120
 

5921
02:03:29,180 --> 02:03:33,830
 heavily but it's actually and and I'm

5922
02:03:32,110 --> 02:03:33,830
 

5923
02:03:32,120 --> 02:03:35,570
 actually on the board of some companies

5924
02:03:33,820 --> 02:03:35,570
 

5925
02:03:33,830 --> 02:03:37,370
 that do a lot of advertising and we have

5926
02:03:35,560 --> 02:03:37,370
 

5927
02:03:35,570 --> 02:03:39,410
 lobbied tech companies to provide the

5928
02:03:37,360 --> 02:03:39,410
 

5929
02:03:37,370 --> 02:03:41,960
 advertisers with those propensity to

5930
02:03:39,400 --> 02:03:41,960
 

5931
02:03:39,410 --> 02:03:44,630
 help us evaluate experiments that we run

5932
02:03:41,950 --> 02:03:44,630
 

5933
02:03:41,960 --> 02:03:46,190
 as well or use observational data so the

5934
02:03:44,620 --> 02:03:46,190
 

5935
02:03:44,630 --> 02:03:47,990
 problem is it's expensive because

5936
02:03:46,180 --> 02:03:47,990
 

5937
02:03:46,190 --> 02:03:49,880
 usually you can think of like if there's

5938
02:03:47,980 --> 02:03:49,880
 

5939
02:03:47,990 --> 02:03:51,410
 randomness going on if you show up at

5940
02:03:49,870 --> 02:03:51,410
 

5941
02:03:49,880 --> 02:03:53,630
 Facebook you know they're just gonna

5942
02:03:51,400 --> 02:03:53,630
 

5943
02:03:51,410 --> 02:03:55,280
 kind of sample from a black box and

5944
02:03:53,620 --> 02:03:55,280
 

5945
02:03:53,630 --> 02:03:57,080
 figure something out if they were gonna

5946
02:03:55,270 --> 02:03:57,080
 

5947
02:03:55,280 --> 02:03:59,480
 get a probability they might have to

5948
02:03:57,070 --> 02:03:59,480
 

5949
02:03:57,080 --> 02:04:01,460
 draw 100 samples from the black box and

5950
02:03:59,470 --> 02:04:01,460
 

5951
02:03:59,480 --> 02:04:04,880
 if it's a black box they can't really

5952
02:04:01,450 --> 02:04:04,880
 

5953
02:04:01,460 --> 02:04:07,130
 write down the the probabilities but

5954
02:04:04,870 --> 02:04:07,130
 

5955
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:09,950
 they could do something like offline it

5956
02:04:07,120 --> 02:04:09,950
 

5957
02:04:07,130 --> 02:04:11,240
 would be approximate and you know so so

5958
02:04:09,940 --> 02:04:11,240
 

5959
02:04:09,950 --> 02:04:12,860
 we wish that they would keep track of

5960
02:04:11,230 --> 02:04:12,860
 

5961
02:04:11,240 --> 02:04:16,400
 them more often and maybe with enough

5962
02:04:12,850 --> 02:04:16,400
 

5963
02:04:12,860 --> 02:04:18,170
 lobbying they will sometimes they do I

5964
02:04:16,390 --> 02:04:18,170
 

5965
02:04:16,400 --> 02:04:19,820
 guess I don't understand why it's a

5966
02:04:18,160 --> 02:04:19,820
 

5967
02:04:18,170 --> 02:04:21,620
 black box that outputs a decision

5968
02:04:19,810 --> 02:04:21,620
 

5969
02:04:19,820 --> 02:04:22,760
 instead of a probability of a decision

5970
02:04:21,610 --> 02:04:22,760
 

5971
02:04:21,620 --> 02:04:23,810
 because like normally in machine

5972
02:04:22,750 --> 02:04:23,810
 

5973
02:04:22,760 --> 02:04:25,910
 learning we output a probability

5974
02:04:23,800 --> 02:04:25,910
 

5975
02:04:23,810 --> 02:04:27,200
 distribution over what you know what

5976
02:04:25,900 --> 02:04:27,200
 

5977
02:04:25,910 --> 02:04:30,140
 decision the classifier is gonna make or

5978
02:04:27,190 --> 02:04:30,140
 

5979
02:04:27,200 --> 02:04:32,420
 something I mean not always so not I

5980
02:04:30,130 --> 02:04:32,420
 

5981
02:04:30,140 --> 02:04:34,580
 mean not always in these tech systems so

5982
02:04:32,410 --> 02:04:34,580
 

5983
02:04:32,420 --> 02:04:36,470
 I mean and you might like for the big

5984
02:04:34,570 --> 02:04:36,470
 

5985
02:04:34,580 --> 02:04:38,480
 search engine you might get you know me

5986
02:04:36,460 --> 02:04:38,480
 

5987
02:04:36,470 --> 02:04:40,730
 like 200 classifiers but then they go

5988
02:04:38,470 --> 02:04:40,730
 

5989
02:04:38,480 --> 02:04:43,670
 into a final thing and then out pops a

5990
02:04:40,720 --> 02:04:43,670
 

5991
02:04:40,730 --> 02:04:45,320
 page so there's there's actually not a

5992
02:04:43,660 --> 02:04:45,320
 

5993
02:04:43,670 --> 02:04:46,040
 probability distribution for all the

5994
02:04:45,310 --> 02:04:46,040
 

5995
02:04:45,320 --> 02:04:54,290
 pages

5996
02:04:46,030 --> 02:04:54,290
 

5997
02:04:46,040 --> 02:04:56,630
 that you could have showed thanks I have

5998
02:04:54,280 --> 02:04:56,630
 

5999
02:04:54,290 --> 02:04:58,280
 question regarding local union forests

6000
02:04:56,620 --> 02:04:58,280
 

6001
02:04:56,630 --> 02:05:00,950
 around the forest that you have used

6002
02:04:58,270 --> 02:05:00,950
 

6003
02:04:58,280 --> 02:05:05,450
 is there any incremental learning behind

6004
02:05:00,940 --> 02:05:05,450
 

6005
02:05:00,950 --> 02:05:08,870
 choosing the number of local random

6006
02:05:05,440 --> 02:05:08,870
 

6007
02:05:05,450 --> 02:05:10,700
 forests yes so I think we have that I

6008
02:05:08,860 --> 02:05:10,700
 

6009
02:05:08,870 --> 02:05:12,890
 would say that's not fully solved so we

6010
02:05:10,690 --> 02:05:12,890
 

6011
02:05:10,700 --> 02:05:14,630
 would suggest that you might do some

6012
02:05:12,880 --> 02:05:14,630
 

6013
02:05:12,890 --> 02:05:16,610
 pre-processing to figure out which

6014
02:05:14,620 --> 02:05:16,610
 

6015
02:05:14,630 --> 02:05:19,010
 co-variants go into that regression we

6016
02:05:16,600 --> 02:05:19,010
 

6017
02:05:16,610 --> 02:05:23,600
 actually use a in the software we use a

6018
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:23,600
 

6019
02:05:19,010 --> 02:05:26,630
 Ridge regressions to regularize okay and

6020
02:05:23,590 --> 02:05:26,630
 

6021
02:05:23,600 --> 02:05:28,700
 it's not very complex because random

6022
02:05:26,620 --> 02:05:28,700
 

6023
02:05:26,630 --> 02:05:31,430
 forests by themselves and that is

6024
02:05:28,690 --> 02:05:31,430
 

6025
02:05:28,700 --> 02:05:33,830
 complex and finding there's are there's

6026
02:05:31,420 --> 02:05:33,830
 

6027
02:05:31,430 --> 02:05:37,160
 a lot of hyper hyper parameters that we

6028
02:05:33,820 --> 02:05:37,160
 

6029
02:05:33,830 --> 02:05:40,520
 need to fix so when you have some local

6030
02:05:37,150 --> 02:05:40,520
 

6031
02:05:37,160 --> 02:05:42,770
 random forests there are huge huge

6032
02:05:40,510 --> 02:05:42,770
 

6033
02:05:40,520 --> 02:05:46,280
 parameters that you need to fix so it's

6034
02:05:42,760 --> 02:05:46,280
 

6035
02:05:42,770 --> 02:05:48,620
 not a little bit complex model yes so

6036
02:05:46,270 --> 02:05:48,620
 

6037
02:05:46,280 --> 02:05:49,910
 the tuning is the tuning makes more of a

6038
02:05:48,610 --> 02:05:49,910
 

6039
02:05:48,620 --> 02:05:52,310
 difference you're absolutely right and

6040
02:05:49,900 --> 02:05:52,310
 

6041
02:05:49,910 --> 02:05:54,080
 we are working on tuning like tuning

6042
02:05:52,300 --> 02:05:54,080
 

6043
02:05:52,310 --> 02:05:56,270
 algorithms but they and they work sort

6044
02:05:54,070 --> 02:05:56,270
 

6045
02:05:54,080 --> 02:05:57,770
 of well but not great okay so and

6046
02:05:56,260 --> 02:05:57,770
 

6047
02:05:56,270 --> 02:06:02,900
 they're computationally expensive so

6048
02:05:57,760 --> 02:06:02,900
 

6049
02:05:57,770 --> 02:06:04,580
 yeah you give something up okay there so

6050
02:06:02,890 --> 02:06:04,580
 

6051
02:06:02,900 --> 02:06:06,680
 you gave a pretty strong recommendation

6052
02:06:04,570 --> 02:06:06,680
 

6053
02:06:04,580 --> 02:06:08,570
 for doubly robust methods yep and you

6054
02:06:06,670 --> 02:06:08,570
 

6055
02:06:06,680 --> 02:06:11,540
 also mention the Atlantic causal

6056
02:06:08,560 --> 02:06:11,540
 

6057
02:06:08,570 --> 02:06:14,660
 inference conference competition and my

6058
02:06:11,530 --> 02:06:14,660
 

6059
02:06:11,540 --> 02:06:18,290
 understood the 2016 results was that

6060
02:06:14,650 --> 02:06:18,290
 

6061
02:06:14,660 --> 02:06:20,810
 modeling outcome alone did extremely

6062
02:06:18,280 --> 02:06:20,810
 

6063
02:06:18,290 --> 02:06:22,790
 well and I was interested in just so

6064
02:06:20,800 --> 02:06:22,790
 

6065
02:06:20,810 --> 02:06:24,560
 your thoughts on that that resultant I

6066
02:06:22,780 --> 02:06:24,560
 

6067
02:06:22,790 --> 02:06:26,270
 don't yes so I think a lot of this

6068
02:06:24,550 --> 02:06:26,270
 

6069
02:06:24,560 --> 02:06:29,450
 really depends on the data generating

6070
02:06:26,260 --> 02:06:29,450
 

6071
02:06:26,270 --> 02:06:30,830
 process so if you can model outcomes

6072
02:06:29,440 --> 02:06:30,830
 

6073
02:06:29,450 --> 02:06:33,770
 well if you have enough data to model

6074
02:06:30,820 --> 02:06:33,770
 

6075
02:06:30,830 --> 02:06:35,810
 outcomes well then the in then the

6076
02:06:33,760 --> 02:06:35,810
 

6077
02:06:33,770 --> 02:06:37,130
 propensity weighting just increases the

6078
02:06:35,800 --> 02:06:37,130
 

6079
02:06:35,810 --> 02:06:39,290
 variance and so I can absolutely

6080
02:06:37,120 --> 02:06:39,290
 

6081
02:06:37,130 --> 02:06:41,060
 generate lots of examples where that can

6082
02:06:39,280 --> 02:06:41,060
 

6083
02:06:39,290 --> 02:06:43,100
 happen but I guess I've been playing a

6084
02:06:41,050 --> 02:06:43,100
 

6085
02:06:41,060 --> 02:06:44,810
 lot with bandits lately where we don't

6086
02:06:43,090 --> 02:06:44,810
 

6087
02:06:43,100 --> 02:06:46,190
 have enough data like in the beginning

6088
02:06:44,800 --> 02:06:46,190
 

6089
02:06:44,810 --> 02:06:49,190
 stages of a bandit you definitely don't

6090
02:06:46,180 --> 02:06:49,190
 

6091
02:06:46,190 --> 02:06:52,700
 have enough data and so the outcome

6092
02:06:49,180 --> 02:06:52,700
 

6093
02:06:49,190 --> 02:06:54,350
 models kind of are not good enough but I

6094
02:06:52,690 --> 02:06:54,350
 

6095
02:06:52,700 --> 02:06:56,030
 think it completely depends it does

6096
02:06:54,340 --> 02:06:56,030
 

6097
02:06:54,350 --> 02:06:57,710
 depend on the setting and the

6098
02:06:56,020 --> 02:06:57,710
 

6099
02:06:56,030 --> 02:07:01,550
 data literature actually has the same

6100
02:06:57,700 --> 02:07:01,550
 

6101
02:06:57,710 --> 02:07:05,540
 message it depends which is a little bit

6102
02:07:01,540 --> 02:07:05,540
 

6103
02:07:01,550 --> 02:07:08,120
 sad but I still feel that as we've moved

6104
02:07:05,530 --> 02:07:08,120
 

6105
02:07:05,540 --> 02:07:10,550
 to higher dimensional methods I think

6106
02:07:08,110 --> 02:07:10,550
 

6107
02:07:08,120 --> 02:07:12,560
 the it pushes us more towards doubly

6108
02:07:10,540 --> 02:07:12,560
 

6109
02:07:10,550 --> 02:07:14,690
 robust and the orthogonalization and

6110
02:07:12,550 --> 02:07:14,690
 

6111
02:07:12,560 --> 02:07:16,640
 then some of the results we have like we

6112
02:07:14,680 --> 02:07:16,640
 

6113
02:07:14,690 --> 02:07:20,480
 have theorems about estimating optimal

6114
02:07:16,630 --> 02:07:20,480
 

6115
02:07:16,640 --> 02:07:22,310
 policies and we have good regret bounds

6116
02:07:20,470 --> 02:07:22,310
 

6117
02:07:20,480 --> 02:07:24,140
 we have the best regret bounds are with

6118
02:07:22,300 --> 02:07:24,140
 

6119
02:07:22,310 --> 02:07:25,670
 doubly robust and we don't think we

6120
02:07:24,130 --> 02:07:25,670
 

6121
02:07:24,140 --> 02:07:27,290
 could get the same regret bounds

6122
02:07:25,660 --> 02:07:27,290
 

6123
02:07:25,670 --> 02:07:29,720
 otherwise although we haven't proven a

6124
02:07:27,280 --> 02:07:29,720
 

6125
02:07:27,290 --> 02:07:31,460
 counter example so I'm becoming more

6126
02:07:29,710 --> 02:07:31,460
 

6127
02:07:29,720 --> 02:07:35,230
 convinced of that but I think any

6128
02:07:31,450 --> 02:07:35,230
 

6129
02:07:31,460 --> 02:07:35,230
 particular competition anything can win

6130
02:07:36,360 --> 02:07:36,360
 

6131
02:07:36,370 --> 02:07:41,660
 ok last question yet hey thanks for the

6132
02:07:39,490 --> 02:07:41,660
 

6133
02:07:39,500 --> 02:07:44,120
 talk and I'd like to ask you a question

6134
02:07:41,650 --> 02:07:44,120
 

6135
02:07:41,660 --> 02:07:46,730
 about the interpretation of the results

6136
02:07:44,110 --> 02:07:46,730
 

6137
02:07:44,120 --> 02:07:50,240
 we got from the use of many ivory like

6138
02:07:46,720 --> 02:07:50,240
 

6139
02:07:46,730 --> 02:07:52,790
 many a bit has because we know that by

6140
02:07:50,230 --> 02:07:52,790
 

6141
02:07:50,240 --> 02:07:54,830
 using IV we basically as made and local

6142
02:07:52,780 --> 02:07:54,830
 

6143
02:07:52,790 --> 02:07:56,360
 average it cause in fact if we have so

6144
02:07:54,820 --> 02:07:56,360
 

6145
02:07:54,830 --> 02:08:00,140
 many IVs that how should we interpret

6146
02:07:56,350 --> 02:08:00,140
 

6147
02:07:56,360 --> 02:08:01,670
 the you know fine ass man yeah it's

6148
02:08:00,130 --> 02:08:01,670
 

6149
02:08:00,140 --> 02:08:02,960
 great question so there's a lot of

6150
02:08:01,660 --> 02:08:02,960
 

6151
02:08:01,670 --> 02:08:05,510
 subtleties with using instrumental

6152
02:08:02,950 --> 02:08:05,510
 

6153
02:08:02,960 --> 02:08:07,400
 variables and if there are unobserved if

6154
02:08:05,500 --> 02:08:07,400
 

6155
02:08:05,510 --> 02:08:09,380
 you there's some unobservable as that

6156
02:08:07,390 --> 02:08:09,380
 

6157
02:08:07,400 --> 02:08:11,000
 affect your treatment effects then it

6158
02:08:09,370 --> 02:08:11,000
 

6159
02:08:09,380 --> 02:08:12,680
 can be very complicated to interpret

6160
02:08:10,990 --> 02:08:12,680
 

6161
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:14,210
 your results so actually my husband's

6162
02:08:12,670 --> 02:08:14,210
 

6163
02:08:12,680 --> 02:08:15,620
 hito in bins who's done a lot of work on

6164
02:08:14,200 --> 02:08:15,620
 

6165
02:08:14,210 --> 02:08:18,200
 local average treatment effects he

6166
02:08:15,610 --> 02:08:18,200
 

6167
02:08:15,620 --> 02:08:19,760
 coined that term and I tried to get him

6168
02:08:18,190 --> 02:08:19,760
 

6169
02:08:18,200 --> 02:08:21,260
 to work on this problem ten years ago

6170
02:08:19,750 --> 02:08:21,260
 

6171
02:08:19,760 --> 02:08:22,940
 and he didn't want to work on it for

6172
02:08:21,250 --> 02:08:22,940
 

6173
02:08:21,260 --> 02:08:24,980
 just the reason that you said he said

6174
02:08:22,930 --> 02:08:24,980
 

6175
02:08:22,940 --> 02:08:26,450
 there'd be too hard too messy and then

6176
02:08:24,970 --> 02:08:26,450
 

6177
02:08:24,980 --> 02:08:31,010
 other people just assumed the problem

6178
02:08:26,440 --> 02:08:31,010
 

6179
02:08:26,450 --> 02:08:33,530
 away and went forward so yeah it's

6180
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,530
 

6181
02:08:31,010 --> 02:08:35,960
 intentional variables can give very

6182
02:08:33,520 --> 02:08:35,960
 

6183
02:08:33,530 --> 02:08:38,570
 messy interpretations and that's just a

6184
02:08:35,950 --> 02:08:38,570
 

6185
02:08:35,960 --> 02:08:43,700
 problem I don't have a solution for I

6186
02:08:38,560 --> 02:08:43,700
 

6187
02:08:38,570 --> 02:09:23,709
 see thanks alright thanks very much

6188
02:08:43,690 --> 02:09:23,709
 

6189
02:08:43,700 --> 02:09:23,709
