00:00:22,292 --> 00:00:24,500
ELIZABETH SPELKE: I want to
start with an observation

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,620
about this summer school.

10
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,480
There's a lot of development
in this summer school.

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,750
You've got two full mornings
devoted to it-- today

12
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,360
and on Thursday.

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,580
It also came up pretty majorly
in Josh Tenenbaum's class

14
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,310
last Friday and I learned
early this morning

15
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,850
also in Shimon Ullman's
class that I couldn't be here

16
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,880
for yesterday afternoon.

17
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,580
And the issues have come up
in many other classes as well,

18
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,630
including Nancy's, Winrich
Freiwald's, and so forth.

19
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:01,010
Now, what's come up is not
only the general questions

20
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:06,170
about development, but specific
questions about human cognitive

21
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:06,980
development.

22
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,050
Questions that have
been addressed primarily

23
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:12,320
through behavioral
experiments, not

24
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,050
experiments using neural
methods or computational models.

25
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:21,350
And the topic that I'm
going to be trying to--

26
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,840
that Allie and I will try
to get you to think about

27
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,090
for this morning is
even narrower than that.

28
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:32,240
It's about the cognitive
capacities of human infants.

29
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,670
And I think a fair
initial question would be,

30
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:37,970
why so much focus on
early human development?

31
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,930
And that question
will get sharper

32
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,140
if you look at where
major organizations are

33
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,520
putting their research money.

34
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,250
They are not putting it
into the kind of work

35
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,590
that I'm going to be
talking about today.

36
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,410
There is no-- in the
Obama BRAIN Initiative,

37
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,550
where they're looking
for new technologies,

38
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,430
there's no call for
new technologies

39
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,560
to figure out what
human knowledge is

40
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,780
like at or near
the initial state

41
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,630
and how it grows over
the course of infancy.

42
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:06,380
And the European
Human Brain Project

43
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:11,510
doesn't have development as
a major area in it, either.

44
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:14,669
So I think it's fair
to ask, why is CBMM

45
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:17,210
taking such a different approach
and putting so much emphasis

46
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,700
on trying to get you guys
to think about and learn

47
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,640
about human development?

48
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,220
And two general
reasons, I think.

49
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,530
One is, it's
intrinsically fascinating.

50
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:28,680
Come on.

51
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,250
We are the most cognitively
interesting creatures

52
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,460
on the planet.

53
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,660
And we're extremely flexible.

54
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:39,500
At the very least, we know
that a human infant can grow up

55
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,160
to be a competent adult in
any human culture of the world

56
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,670
today and any human culture
that existed in prehistory.

57
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,732
And that means
extremely varied--

58
00:02:48,732 --> 00:02:50,690
they've had to learn
extremely different things

59
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,850
under different
circumstances and have

60
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,980
succeeded at doing that.

61
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:59,300
We also know that by the
time they start school,

62
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:04,160
if they go to school at
all, the really hard work

63
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,650
of developing a common-sense
understanding of the world

64
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:07,880
is done.

65
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,120
That is, it's not explicitly
taught to children.

66
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,571
Most of it isn't
even very strongly

67
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:16,070
implicitly taught to them in
the form of other people trying

68
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,300
to get them to learn things.

69
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,425
What you're trying to do
when you have a young kid,

70
00:03:19,425 --> 00:03:22,880
as those of you who have them
know, or have had them know,

71
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:30,230
is you're trying to get them not
to climb off cliffs or explore

72
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,247
the hot pots on the
stove and so forth.

73
00:03:32,247 --> 00:03:34,580
You're really not spending
very much of your time trying

74
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,170
to get them to learn new stuff.

75
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,890
They're doing that on their own.

76
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,950
So it's I think a really
interesting question,

77
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:40,700
how do we do that?

78
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,491
Intrinsically interesting
in its own right,

79
00:03:42,491 --> 00:03:45,980
even if it were of
no other use to us.

80
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,230
But historically it's
also been recognized

81
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,930
as being really
important for efforts

82
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,690
to understand the human mind,
understand the human brain,

83
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:56,070
and build intelligent machines.

84
00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:01,670
So Helmholtz, who came up
in Eero's talk last night,

85
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:05,420
was not only a brilliant
neurophysiologist

86
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:09,440
and a physicist, he was
extremely interested

87
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,810
in perception and cognition.

88
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,150
And he wrote about
fundamental questions

89
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,149
about human perceptual
knowledge and experience.

90
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:21,320
How is it that we experience
the world as three-dimensional?

91
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,800
He concluded that we
didn't know the answer

92
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,550
and never could know
the answer, unless we

93
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:29,810
could find ways to do systematic
experiments on infants

94
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,290
of the sort that could already
be done to reveal mechanisms

95
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:36,110
of color vision, for
example, as were described

96
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,790
last night on adults--

97
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:40,194
systematic psychophysical
experiments on infants.

98
00:04:40,194 --> 00:04:41,610
But he looked at
infants and said,

99
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,122
I don't see any way to do that.

100
00:04:44,122 --> 00:04:46,580
We can't train them to make
psychophysical judgments and so

101
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,760
forth.

102
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,090
But he was aware of
their centrality.

103
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:54,080
So was Turing, who
in thinking ahead

104
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,770
to how one might build
intelligent machines,

105
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:00,200
suggested that one aim
to build a machine that

106
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,170
could learn about the
world the way children do.

107
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,630
And a side of the
work that's come up

108
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,660
so many times in the whole
Hubel-Wiesel tradition that

109
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,610
started in the
late '50s, I think

110
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:14,300
one of the most exciting
and important developments

111
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,210
within that field,
we're not just

112
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,460
focusing on the response
properties of neurons

113
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,640
in mature visual
systems, but rather

114
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,490
on the development
of those neurons

115
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,530
and the effects of
experience on them.

116
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,980
When you discover that you
get these gorgeous stripes

117
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:35,490
of monocularly-driven
cells in V1,

118
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,790
it then immediately became
really interesting to ask,

119
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:41,030
suppose an animal were
only looking at the world

120
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:41,720
through one eye?

121
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,280
Or suppose they could look at
the world through the two eyes,

122
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,460
but not at the same time,
or not at the same things

123
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,300
at the same time?

124
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,460
What would happen
to those cells?

125
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,640
And there was gorgeous work
addressing those questions

126
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,270
from the beginning.

127
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,830
Now, that work has somewhat
receded from attention.

128
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,160
I think that's a mistake.

129
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,770
I think that
there's a great deal

130
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,680
to be learned from those
kinds of studies now.

131
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,712
And if I get nothing else
across over this time,

132
00:06:07,712 --> 00:06:09,170
I hope you'll at
least get the idea

133
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,330
that this is a field
worth following, looking

134
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:15,590
at development in humans,
looking at development

135
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:18,470
of perceptual and
cognitive capacities

136
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:24,380
in animal models of human
intelligence as well.

137
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,680
So more specifically,
I think there

138
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:32,090
are three questions
about human cognition

139
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,280
for which studies
of early development

140
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,730
in general and in human
infants in particular

141
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,872
can shed light on.

142
00:06:38,872 --> 00:06:41,330
Two of them I'm not going to
really be talking about today,

143
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,220
except indirectly.

144
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,220
One is the question,
what distinguishes us

145
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,340
from other animals?

146
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,144
We come into the world with
very similar equipment.

147
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:52,310
But look what we do with it.

148
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,490
We create these utterly
different systems of knowledge

149
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,560
that no other animal
seems to share.

150
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,590
What is it about us that
sets us on a different path

151
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,510
from other animals?

152
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,920
That's question one.

153
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,460
And the other question
I won't talk about is--

154
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,450
well, I'll talk about
it a tiny bit, but not

155
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:12,020
directly-- is, where do
abstract ideas come from?

156
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,840
It seems like we not only
develop systems of knowledge,

157
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,130
but those systems
center on concepts

158
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:22,400
that refer to things that
could never in principle

159
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,010
be seen or acted on.

160
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:29,060
Like the concept "seven,"
or the concept "triangle,"

161
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:34,070
or the concept "belief," or
ethical concepts and so forth.

162
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,260
Abstract concepts
organize our knowledge.

163
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:40,520
But since they can't be
seen or touched or produced

164
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,830
through our actions, how
do we come to know them?

165
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,720
I think studies of
early development

166
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,314
can shed light on that as well.

167
00:07:46,314 --> 00:07:48,980
But the question I want to focus
on today is the third question,

168
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:52,880
and it's the one that
Josh raised on Friday.

169
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,350
How do we get so much
from so little as adults?

170
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,390
As adults, you look at
one of the photographs

171
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,040
he showed of just
an ordinary scene

172
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,650
and you can immediately
make predictions about,

173
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,450
if you were to bang
it, what would happen?

174
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,230
What would fall?

175
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,730
What would roll?

176
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,920
We seem to get this
very, very rich knowledge

177
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:15,500
from this very, very
limited body of information

178
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,450
at any given time.

179
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:20,910
And what that
suggests is that we

180
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,420
are able to bring to
bear in interpreting

181
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,180
that scene a whole
body of knowledge

182
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,110
that we already have about
the world and how it behaves.

183
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,140
But that raises the question,
what is it that we know

184
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,500
and how is our
knowledge organized?

185
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:43,715
What aspects of the world do we
represent most fundamentally?

186
00:08:43,715 --> 00:08:46,870
Which of our concepts
are most important to us

187
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,980
and generate the other
concepts and so forth?

188
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,940
How can we carve human
knowledge at its joints?

189
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,800
And now this can be
studied in adults

190
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,720
and you've seen a number
of examples of this.

191
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,750
You saw it in Nancy's
talk last Tuesday, right?

192
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:03,050
Anyway, last week sometime.

193
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:06,500
Studies using
functional brain imaging

194
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:11,930
to get at our representations
of human faces.

195
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,830
You saw it in Josh's talk.

196
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,770
He was mostly using
data from adults

197
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:21,680
to be probing the knowledge
of intuitive physics

198
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,620
that he was focused on and that
his computational models are

199
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,210
trying to capture.

200
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:29,010
You're going to see
it on Thursday in--

201
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:31,430
no, tomorrow in
Rebecca Saxe's talk,

202
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:35,720
where she'll talk about human
adults' attributions of beliefs

203
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,260
and desires and other
mental states to people.

204
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,660
It's certainly
studyable in adults,

205
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:45,166
but it's difficult to
answer these questions.

206
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,540
It's difficult to answer these
questions in any creature,

207
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,081
but I think it's
especially difficult

208
00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:52,230
to answer these questions in
adults for a couple of reasons.

209
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,440
One is that our knowledge
is simply too rich.

210
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,350
By the time we get to be
adults, we know so much

211
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,330
and we have so many
alternative ways

212
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,330
of solving any
particular problem,

213
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,710
that it's a real
challenge to try

214
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:05,860
to sift through
all our abilities

215
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,130
and figure out what the really
fundamental, most fundamental

216
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:11,314
concepts that we have are.

217
00:10:11,314 --> 00:10:12,730
And the second
problem with adults

218
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:15,910
is we not only know too
much, we're too flexible.

219
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:19,030
We can essentially relate
anything to anything.

220
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,800
We can use information
from the face

221
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,370
to answer all sorts of
questions about the world.

222
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:28,600
And here, I think, infants are
useful for a maybe seemingly

223
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,070
paradoxical reason.

224
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,020
They're much less
cognitively capable.

225
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,150
They know much less about
the world and they're

226
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,590
far less flexible--

227
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,090
I'll show you examples of this--

228
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:39,010
far less flexible in
the kinds of things

229
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:43,330
that they can do with the
knowledge that they do have.

230
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:46,960
Nevertheless, they seem to
come into the world equipped

231
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,540
with knowledge that
supports later learning.

232
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,760
And because it's
supporting later learning,

233
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,000
it's being preserved
over that learning.

234
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,190
It's being incorporated
in all of the later things

235
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,390
that we learn.

236
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,560
So it remains fundamental
to us as adults.

237
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,830
And I think this can
help us, to think

238
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:08,470
about how our own knowledge
of the world is organized.

239
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,270
OK.

240
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,500
So that's a general overview.

241
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,580
How do we study infants?

242
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:16,600
Now here's where the
tables turn radically.

243
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,420
We have way better methods for
studying cognition in adults

244
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:23,140
than we do in infants,
just as Helmholtz thought.

245
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,554
They can't talk to us.

246
00:11:24,554 --> 00:11:26,470
They don't understand
us when we talk to them,

247
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,820
so we can't give them structure.

248
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:33,460
Oh, and unlike willing
trained animals,

249
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,830
you can't train
them to do things,

250
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:39,490
at least not in
any extended sense.

251
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,480
They can't do much.

252
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,550
I'm most interested in
infants in the first four

253
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:45,100
months of life before they
even start reaching for things,

254
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:50,710
much less sitting up by
themselves or moving around.

255
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,070
The interesting thing is,
from day one, from the moment

256
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,010
that they're born, they're
observing the world.

257
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:00,850
They're looking at things and
they're getting information

258
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,670
from what they see.

259
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:06,580
Now, their observations-- we've
learned over the last half

260
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:10,270
century or so that their
observations are systematic

261
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,970
and they're reflected in very
simple exploratory behaviors,

262
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:16,215
like when a sound happens
somewhere in the visual field,

263
00:12:16,215 --> 00:12:18,340
turning the head and
orienting it toward the sound.

264
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,830
Even newborn infants
will do that.

265
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:24,130
Or if something new or
interesting is presented,

266
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:26,975
infants will tend to look at it.

267
00:12:26,975 --> 00:12:28,600
And these behaviors
I think can tell us

268
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,000
something about what
infants perceive and know.

269
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,482
And before getting to the
real substance of what

270
00:12:34,482 --> 00:12:36,190
I want to focus on
today, let me give you

271
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,990
a few examples of this.

272
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,420
What kinds of things
do infants look at?

273
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:44,320
Well, if you present
even a newborn infant--

274
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,880
infants at any age, really--

275
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,692
with two displays
side by side, and vary

276
00:12:49,692 --> 00:12:52,150
properties of those displays
and the relation between them,

277
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:55,130
you'll see that they look at
some things more than others.

278
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:57,160
So they'll look at
black-and-white stripes

279
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,500
more than they'll look at
a homogeneous gray field.

280
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,760
That's useful.

281
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,070
It allowed people to
get initial measures

282
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:06,905
of the development of visual
acuity which infants--

283
00:13:06,905 --> 00:13:10,210
it actually overturned
a somewhat popular view

284
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:12,540
that at birth, infants
couldn't see at all.

285
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,860
We know from these simple
studies that they can.

286
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,110
And we also know that their
acuity starts out very low

287
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,150
but gets pretty good
by the time they're

288
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,040
four to six months of age.

289
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,857
It doesn't reach full adult
levels until about two years.

290
00:13:23,857 --> 00:13:25,690
We also know that they
look at moving arrays

291
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:28,750
more than stationary
arrays, and they

292
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,520
look at
three-dimensional objects

293
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:34,300
more than
two-dimensional objects.

294
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,880
In addition to having
intrinsic preferences

295
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,180
between different
things, they also

296
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,820
have a preference for looking
at displays that change

297
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,340
or displays that
present something new.

298
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,680
So jumping from the '50s
when those first studies were

299
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,560
done up to the '80s,
there was a whole flurry

300
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:57,790
of studies showing babies pairs
of cats on a series of trials

301
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,500
and then switching
to a cat and a dog.

302
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,520
And the babies
would look longer--

303
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,936
these are
three-month-olds-- would

304
00:14:01,936 --> 00:14:06,760
look longer at the dog than
at a new example of a cat.

305
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,700
So they're able to
orient to novelty.

306
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,250
And they also look
longer at a visual array

307
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,980
that connects in some way
to something they can hear.

308
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,340
Now, one of the things I spend
a lot of my time studying

309
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:22,330
is foundations of mathematics--
numerical and spatial cognition

310
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:22,930
in infants.

311
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,850
I'm not going to talk
about it at all today.

312
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:27,280
But I kind of couldn't resist
giving just one example

313
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,710
of looking at what you hear that
connects to infant sensitivity

314
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:32,620
to a number.

315
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,110
This is a study that
was conducted in France

316
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,720
by Veronique Izard
and her colleagues

317
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,450
with newborn infants in
a maternity hospital.

318
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:46,670
She played infants
sequences of sounds,

319
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:50,560
and each sequence involved
repetitions of a syllable.

320
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,220
For half the infants, each
syllable appeared four times.

321
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,500
For the others, it
appeared 12 times.

322
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,750
And for the ones for which
it appeared four times,

323
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,340
each syllable was
three times as long.

324
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,798
So the total duration
of a sequence

325
00:15:01,798 --> 00:15:03,570
was the same for the
two groups, but one

326
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,300
involved four syllables
and one involved 12.

327
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:10,060
And after they heard
that for a minute,

328
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,060
the sound continued to
play and now she showed,

329
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,820
side by side, an
array of four objects

330
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,800
versus an array of 12 objects.

331
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,930
And the babies tended to
look at the array that

332
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:23,880
corresponded in number to
what they were hearing.

333
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,970
Now, all of this gives us
something to work with,

334
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:30,070
but it raises a nasty problem.

335
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,740
And the problem
is, what are babies

336
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,390
perceiving or understanding?

337
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,250
Today we're not
going to be asking,

338
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,650
how can babies classify things?

339
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,090
What do they respond
to similarly?

340
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,591
What do they respond
to differently?

341
00:15:40,591 --> 00:15:43,006
We're going to be asking, what
sense do they make of them?

342
00:15:43,006 --> 00:15:44,280
What are they representing?

343
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:49,050
What the content of
the representations

344
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:52,050
that they're forming
in each of these cases?

345
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:57,090
And these studies as I've just
described them don't tell us.

346
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:01,470
Let's take the case of the
sphere versus the disk.

347
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:04,800
When this study was
first conducted,

348
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,950
the author concluded that
babies have depth perception,

349
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:10,320
that they perceive
three-dimensional solid

350
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,180
objects.

351
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,707
Is that a justifiable
conclusion?

352
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:14,790
AUDIENCE: Not necessarily.

353
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,590
ELIZABETH SPELKE: Why not?

354
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,590
AUDIENCE: Because they
are not [INAUDIBLE]..

355
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:18,990
ELIZABETH SPELKE: Yeah.

356
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:19,490
OK.

357
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:22,770
So when you present things
that differ in depth,

358
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:26,310
you're presenting a host of
different visual features

359
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,710
that for us as adults
are cues to depth.

360
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:31,114
The question is, are they
cues to depth for the infant?

361
00:16:31,114 --> 00:16:33,030
And the fact that the
infant is looking longer

362
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,910
at something we would call a
sphere than at something we

363
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,460
would call a disk, doesn't
tell us whether they're looking

364
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,920
longer because they're
thinking, "sphere,"

365
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,837
or "3D," or "solid,"
or something like that,

366
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:46,170
or whether they're looking
longer because they're seeing

367
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,670
a more interesting
pattern of motion

368
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:51,994
as they move their head around,
or because as they converge

369
00:16:51,994 --> 00:16:54,660
on one part of the array they're
getting interesting differences

370
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,993
in how in-focus different
parts of it are, and so forth.

371
00:16:56,993 --> 00:16:58,560
All of the different
cues to depth

372
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,184
could-- what we want
to know is, what's

373
00:17:00,184 --> 00:17:02,262
the basis of this preference?

374
00:17:02,262 --> 00:17:03,720
And the existence
of the preference

375
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,040
doesn't tell us that.

376
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:09,540
Similarly for the
cats, and similarly

377
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,849
for this single
isolated experiment

378
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:13,500
that I gave you
on number, right?

379
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,440
Does this say anything
whatsoever about number,

380
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,780
or could there be
some sensory variable

381
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,660
where there's just more going
on in a stream of 12 sounds

382
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:25,500
and there's more going on
in an array of 12 objects,

383
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,980
and babies are matching more
with more, independently

384
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:29,480
of number?

385
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,770
These studies in
themselves don't tell us.

386
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:34,260
In order to find out,
what we need to do

387
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,260
is take these methods and
do systematic experiments.

388
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,710
And these experiments work best
under the following conditions.

389
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:44,730
When you're studying a
function that exists in adults

390
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,840
and whose properties have been
explored in adults in detail

391
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,080
systematically, when you have
a body of psychophysical data

392
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,110
that you can rest on in
your understanding of what's

393
00:17:55,110 --> 00:18:00,450
happening in adults, and you
can then apply that to infants.

394
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:03,140
So one example of that
took as its point of-- this

395
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:07,470
is work by Richard Held,
a wonderful perception

396
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:11,067
psychologist who worked at MIT.

397
00:18:11,067 --> 00:18:12,150
Still is active, actually.

398
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,250
He's retired but still active.

399
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,840
And he did these
beautiful experiments

400
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,009
that started with the
sphere-versus-disk phenomenon.

401
00:18:18,009 --> 00:18:19,800
And first of all, he
tried to take it apart

402
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,550
and say, let's just focus
on one cue today, OK?

403
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:25,500
Binocular disparity at the
basis of stereo vision.

404
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,810
So he put stereo
goggles on babies.

405
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:30,630
These were babies ranging in
age up to about from birth

406
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,640
to about four months, I think.

407
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,820
He put stereo goggles on
them and showed them, side

408
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,590
by side, two arrays of stripes.

409
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:42,240
In one of the arrays, the
same image went to both eyes.

410
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,400
In the other arrays,
the edges of the stripes

411
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,580
were offset in a way
that leads an adult

412
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,610
to see them as organized in
depth-- some stripes in front

413
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:52,560
of others.

414
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:57,270
And he showed that infants
looked longer at the array with

415
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,880
the disparity-specified
differences in depth than

416
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,650
the array where it didn't.

417
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,360
He did not conclude
from that that they

418
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,460
have depth perception,
but it gave him

419
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,760
a basis for doing a whole series
of experiments that asked,

420
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,130
in effect, do you
see this effect

421
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:14,340
under all and only the
conditions in which adults

422
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,350
have functional stereopsis?

423
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:19,690
So he showed, for example,
that if you rotate the array

424
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:23,130
sideways 45 degrees
so that you still

425
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,170
have double images
on the stereo side,

426
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,570
but we wouldn't see depth
because our eyes are

427
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:30,820
side by side, not one above the
other, the effect goes away.

428
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,430
He varied the
degree of disparity

429
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,560
and showed that you
only get this preference

430
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:39,450
within this narrow range where
we have functional stereopsis.

431
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:42,940
And he was able to show the
striking continuity between all

432
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,910
of the properties
of stereo vision

433
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,370
in adults and in these infants.

434
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:51,090
So that study and a bunch of
others using other methods,

435
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,700
I think have resolved this
question of whether depth--

436
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,680
when depth perception begins.

437
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,060
Its beginning very early.

438
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:00,755
Stereopsis comes in around
two to three months of age.

439
00:20:00,755 --> 00:20:02,420
Other depth cues
come in at birth.

440
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,980
It's beginning very, very early.

441
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,771
But it didn't come from
single experiments.

442
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:08,701
It came from systematic
patterns of experiments.

443
00:20:08,701 --> 00:20:10,700
In the case of cats versus
dogs, we don't really

444
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,070
have a psychophysics
of cat perception,

445
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:15,950
but steps have been taken to
try to get to what the basis is

446
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:19,850
of infants' distinction
between dogs

447
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,260
and cats in those experiments.

448
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,900
And interestingly, what's
popped out are faces.

449
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,780
Turns out, you can occlude the
cat and the dog's whole bodies,

450
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:29,197
and if you leave their
faces, you get these effects.

451
00:20:29,197 --> 00:20:31,280
If you occlude their faces
and leave their bodies,

452
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,460
you mostly do not,
unless you cheat and give

453
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,860
other obvious features, like
all the dogs are standing

454
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,170
and all the cats are sitting,
or something like that.

455
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,830
But in the normal case,
faces are coming out

456
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:46,696
as an important ingredient
of that distinction.

457
00:20:46,696 --> 00:20:48,320
In the case of abstract
number, there's

458
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,100
also a lot of work in
adults on our ability

459
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,850
to apprehend at a glance
approximate numerical value

460
00:20:55,850 --> 00:21:00,500
of sounds in a sequence
or visual arrays.

461
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,320
We've learned a lot about the
conditions under which we can

462
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,120
do that and the conditions
under which we can't.

463
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:10,070
That's not my topic for today,
but Izard and her collaborators

464
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,200
have been testing for
all of those conditions

465
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,280
in newborn infants.

466
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,670
And so far, so good.

467
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:17,540
It looks like there
is a similar alignment

468
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,140
between the patterns of--

469
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:22,310
the factors that influence
infants' responses

470
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:24,140
in those studies
where they hear sounds

471
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,540
and see arrays of
objects and the factors

472
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:31,720
that influence our abilities to
apprehend approximate number.

473
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,420
OK.

474
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,656
So this gives us some good
news and some bad news.

475
00:21:35,656 --> 00:21:37,280
The good news is that
I think questions

476
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:42,410
about the content of infants'
perception and understanding

477
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,960
of the world can be addressed.

478
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,440
The bad news is that we
can't do it very fast.

479
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,390
You can't do it with a single
silver-bullet experiment.

480
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,990
You have to do it with a
long and extensive pattern

481
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:55,070
of research.

482
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:58,550
In the past, research on infants
has gone extremely slowly.

483
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,350
Basically, the
methods that we have

484
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:03,890
allow you to ask each baby who
comes into the lab maybe one,

485
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:06,260
or if you're lucky, a
couple of questions,

486
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,070
but not more than that.

487
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:11,600
So it takes a long time
to do a single experiment.

488
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,990
I do think, though,
that this work is

489
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:20,300
poised to accelerate
dramatically

490
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,980
and that we're poised to--

491
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,440
this is a good time to be
thinking about infant cognition

492
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,000
because I think we're soon going
to be in a different world,

493
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,333
where we can start asking
these questions at a much more

494
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:30,230
rapid pace.

495
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:32,990
That's for at least two reasons,
both of which, by the way,

496
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:38,490
are being fostered by the Center
for Brains, Minds and Machines

497
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:41,630
and undertaken by people
who are part of that center.

498
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:45,230
One is, there are now efforts
underway to be able to test

499
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,580
infants on the web.

500
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,770
These basic simple
behavioral studies, you

501
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:52,430
can assess looking
time using the webcam

502
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:58,520
in an iPad or a laptop, and
you can test babies that way.

503
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,120
And there's attempts
to do that, which

504
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,994
would make it possible
to collect data doing

505
00:23:01,994 --> 00:23:03,410
the same kinds of
experiments that

506
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:06,220
have been done in the past,
but much more quickly.

507
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,530
Two, as Nancy already
mentioned and Rebecca

508
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,900
may talk about
tomorrow, there are

509
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:15,470
efforts underway to use
functional brain imaging

510
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:19,080
to get at not only
what infants look at,

511
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,370
but what regions of the brain
are activated when they look

512
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,930
at those things,
which will give us

513
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:26,570
a more specific signal of
what infants are attending

514
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:31,500
to and processing, someday,
hopefully, in the near future.

515
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,397
And we just had a
retreat of CBMM,

516
00:23:35,397 --> 00:23:36,980
where there was a
lot of brainstorming

517
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,540
about new technologies
to try to get

518
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,831
more than just simple looking
time out of young babies.

519
00:23:40,831 --> 00:23:43,316
So maybe some of that
will work as well.

520
00:23:43,316 --> 00:23:44,690
But what I want
to focus on today

521
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:47,390
is that even this
slow, plodding research

522
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:49,360
has gone on for long
enough at this point

523
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,400
that I think we've learned
something about what infants

524
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,820
perceive and what they know.

525
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:59,310
And I tried to put what I think
we learned into two slides.

526
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,950
Here's the first one.

527
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:03,710
I think that very
early in development,

528
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:06,650
baby in the newborn
period, but anyway,

529
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:08,990
before babies are starting
to reach for things

530
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:13,280
and move around on
their own, they already

531
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:18,290
have a set of functioning
cognitive systems,

532
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,410
each specific to a
different domain.

533
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:25,700
One is a system for representing
objects and their motions,

534
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,980
collisions, and
other interactions.

535
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,310
Another is a system
for representing people

536
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:34,880
as agents who act on
objects, and in doing so,

537
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,620
pursue goals and cause
changes in the world.

538
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:42,290
A third is a system
for perceiving people

539
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:46,250
as social beings who can
communicate with, engage

540
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:50,630
with other social beings
and share mental states.

541
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:53,372
And then three other systems
that I won't talk about today.

542
00:24:53,372 --> 00:24:54,830
One system of
number, which I think

543
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:58,370
is being tapped in that
first Izard experiment.

544
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:01,800
And two systems capturing
aspects of geometry,

545
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:06,120
one supporting navigation of the
sort that Matt Wilson studies,

546
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:11,630
the other supporting visual form
perception of the sort that IT

547
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:17,100
and occipital cortex represent.

548
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,880
I think each of these
systems operates as a whole.

549
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,980
In Josh's terms
from last Friday,

550
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,410
it's internally compositional.

551
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:27,810
Infants don't just come
equipped with a set

552
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:31,050
of local facts about how objects
behave, they come equipped

553
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:34,080
with a set of more general rules
or principles that allow them

554
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,300
to deal with objects
in novel situations

555
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:40,360
and make productive inferences
about their interactions

556
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,420
and behavior.

557
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,030
Each of these
systems is partially

558
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:47,250
distinct from the other systems.

559
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,990
It's distinct in three ways.

560
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:51,240
First, each of them operates
on different information.

561
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,010
It's elicited under
different conditions.

562
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:59,070
Second, it gives rise to
different representations

563
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,660
with different content.

564
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:04,240
And third, most deeply, it
answers different questions.

565
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,600
So for example, we
have two-- infants

566
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,360
have two systems for
reasoning about people,

567
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,560
but each system is answering
a different question.

568
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,481
The agent system is
answering the question,

569
00:26:13,481 --> 00:26:14,480
what is this guy's goal?

570
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,813
What is he trying to accomplish?

571
00:26:15,813 --> 00:26:19,380
What changes is he
affecting in the world?

572
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,080
The social system is asking,
who is this guy related to?

573
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,400
Who is he connected to?

574
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,360
Who is he communicating with?

575
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,500
Each of the systems are limited,
extremely limited relative

576
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,360
to what we find in adults.

577
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,640
Each captures only
a tiny part of what

578
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:39,690
we as adults know
about objects or agents

579
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:41,209
or social interactions.

580
00:26:41,209 --> 00:26:42,750
Each of them, I
think, interestingly,

581
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,490
is shared by other animals.

582
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:47,040
I didn't expect
that to be true when

583
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,870
we started doing this research.

584
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:53,040
But as far as we can see so far,
it's hard to find anything that

585
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,490
a young human infant can do
that a non-human animal can't.

586
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,140
And I'll give you
examples of that, too.

587
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:02,610
And finally-- and I won't talk
about this much, unfortunately.

588
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:04,500
I think each of these
systems continues

589
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,080
to function throughout life
and supports the development

590
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,990
of new systems of knowledge.

591
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:12,150
So when we think thoughts
that only humans think,

592
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:14,260
we engage these
fundamental systems

593
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:17,880
that we've had since infancy
and other animals share.

594
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,770
I also think this
research tells us

595
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,300
something about how we do that.

596
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:24,120
I think that in
addition to having

597
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,280
these basic early
developing systems,

598
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,520
we have a uniquely
human capacity

599
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,830
to productively
combine information

600
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:36,510
across these systems, and
through those combinations,

601
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:39,900
to construct new concepts.

602
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,910
I think these new
concepts underlie,

603
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,940
or they tend to be
abstract, and they

604
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:48,090
underlie a set of very important
later-developing systems

605
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:50,380
of knowledge,
including knowledge

606
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:54,630
that allow us to form
taxonomies of objects, of tools,

607
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:59,700
of natural kinds like
animals and plants,

608
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,350
and to reason about
their behavior,

609
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,660
such that when we
encounter some new thing,

610
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,970
we already know a lot
about the kind of thing

611
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:09,600
that it is and can
use that to infer many

612
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,150
of its specific
properties, and also

613
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:14,190
to direct our learning
very explicitly to fill

614
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:16,710
in the gaps in our knowledge.

615
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:19,320
Another is the systems
of natural number

616
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,910
in Euclidean geometry.

617
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:24,300
Natural number, children seem to
construct over the first three

618
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,680
to five years of life.

619
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:29,190
Euclidean geometry seems to take
much longer, much, much later.

620
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:32,550
Molly Dillon, who's also
here, has been trying to work

621
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:35,370
on understanding-- and
so has Veronique Izard--

622
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:37,170
how children go from
six years of age,

623
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:39,630
where they seem absolutely
clueless about the simplest

624
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:43,010
properties of Euclidean
geometry, to 12-year-olds who,

625
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:45,510
whether they're in the Amazon
and have never been to school,

626
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:51,540
or studying geometry
in school, seem

627
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:54,090
to have a basic rudimentary
understanding of points

628
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:57,270
and lines and figures
on the Euclidean plane.

629
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:59,426
A third is a system of
persons and mental states.

630
00:28:59,426 --> 00:29:01,050
And I won't talk
about it, but I'm only

631
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:03,270
talking for the first
half or so of this time,

632
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,250
then Alia Martin's
going to take over.

633
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:06,780
And you'll touch on--

634
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:09,480
you'll get to some
of those issues.

635
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:14,160
Now, as Nancy said last week, I
have this out-there hypothesis

636
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,410
that I don't think anybody
else in the world believes,

637
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:18,060
but I still believe it.

638
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:21,060
That this productive
combinatorial capacity

639
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:24,120
either is or is
intimately tied to what's

640
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,310
the most obvious cognitive
difference between us

641
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:30,390
and other animals, namely our
faculty of natural language.

642
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:33,870
In particular, I
think that there

643
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:36,330
are two general properties
of natural language

644
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:39,930
that make it an ideal medium
for forming combinations

645
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:42,790
of new concepts.

646
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:46,560
One is that the words
and the rules of--

647
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,090
well, three
properties, actually.

648
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:52,230
One is that the syntactic
and semantic rules

649
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:54,600
of natural languages
are combinatorial and

650
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,300
compositional.

651
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,780
That is, if you learn
the meanings of words

652
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,770
and you learn how
to combine them,

653
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:02,190
you get the meanings of
the expressions for free.

654
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:03,740
You don't need to
go out and learn

655
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,960
what a brown cow is if
you know what brown is

656
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,220
and you know what a cow is.

657
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:13,490
Second, the words and the
rules of natural language

658
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:15,680
apply across all domains.

659
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,500
They're not restricted to
one domain or another the way

660
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:22,010
infants' other cognitive
capacities seem to be.

661
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:26,600
So if you learn
how "cow" behaves

662
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,660
in the expression "brown cow,"
and then you hear "brown ball,"

663
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,910
or something that a different
domain of core knowledge

664
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:35,750
would be capturing,
you can immediately

665
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:38,070
interpret that
combination as well.

666
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:41,510
And then the last thing about
natural language that I think

667
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:44,960
makes it so useful for cognitive
development is that it's

668
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,520
learned from other people.

669
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,560
And other people
talk about the things

670
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,200
that they find useful
to think about, right?

671
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,720
Word frequency is
a really good proxy

672
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:57,740
for what the useful
concepts out there are.

673
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:03,980
So a child who has a very
powerful combinatorial system

674
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:06,560
that can create a
huge set of concepts

675
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,590
is going to have a search
problem when they try to apply

676
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,150
those concepts to the world.

677
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:12,670
Something will
happen in the world.

678
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:15,380
And if they now have
a million concepts

679
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,600
that they could bring to
bear, which one are they

680
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,300
going to use?

681
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,960
Are they to test them all out?

682
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,780
Having too many concepts,
too many innate concepts,

683
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:26,360
would not necessarily
be a blessing.

684
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,819
But if you use language to guide
you to the useful concepts,

685
00:31:29,819 --> 00:31:30,860
I think you'll do better.

686
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,450
The ones people are going
to talk about around

687
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:34,699
you most frequently are going
to be the ones that it's

688
00:31:34,699 --> 00:31:37,350
going to be most useful for you
to be learning at that point.

689
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:41,180
So let's go back to that first
set of questions, which is what

690
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:43,980
I want to be focusing on today.

691
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,610
And as I said, I'll
talk particularly

692
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:49,090
about three domains
where infants

693
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:51,020
seem to develop
knowledge quite rapidly

694
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,460
over the course of infancy.

695
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:56,300
And I'll spend most of my time
on the first one, objects.

696
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:00,350
So object cognition
is really interesting

697
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:02,810
and it seems to span
this really big range.

698
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:06,280
It seems to involve many
different kinds of processes.

699
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,510
If you're going to figure
out what the objects are,

700
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:11,330
what the bodies are
in a scene, then you

701
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:13,760
need segmentation abilities.

702
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,770
You need to be able to
take an array like this

703
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:19,490
and break it down into
units, figuring out

704
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:22,890
what different parts of that
array lie on the same object

705
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:26,240
and what parts lie
on different ones.

706
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,720
So early mechanisms
for doing that

707
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:33,170
can participate in
object representation.

708
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:36,320
But also to perceive
objects, arrays are cluttered

709
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,200
and objects tend to be opaque.

710
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,690
And when they are,
it's never the case

711
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:43,550
that all of the
surfaces of one object

712
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,930
are in view at the same time.

713
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:46,610
And it's often the
case that you're only

714
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:49,430
seeing a little bit of any
given object at a time.

715
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:50,900
Yet somehow we're
able to see this

716
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,600
as a continuous table that's
extending behind everything

717
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,520
that's sitting on it, and even
sort of as a continuous plate,

718
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,170
a single plate that's partly--

719
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:04,560
that's on the table behind
the vase, and so forth.

720
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,470
So to represent
objects, we've got

721
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:08,540
to be able to take
these visual fragments

722
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:11,330
and put them together in
the right sorts of ways.

723
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:14,450
Something that's harder
to show in a static image,

724
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:17,000
but that of course is
radically true about the world

725
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,610
is that our perceptual
encounters with objects

726
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:20,840
are intermittent.

727
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,670
We can look away
and then look back,

728
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,270
or an object can
move out of view

729
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,940
and then come back
into view, yet

730
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:29,270
what we experience is a world
of persisting objects that

731
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:31,520
are existing and moving
on connected paths,

732
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,430
whether we're looking
at them or not.

733
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,750
And finally, objects
interact with other objects

734
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,720
and we need to work
out those interactions.

735
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,470
And the working out
that I'm interested in

736
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:44,710
is not what this
little boy is doing,

737
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:46,430
but what his younger
sister is doing

738
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:48,080
as she's sitting
in her infant seat

739
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,720
and observing him
acting on these towers

740
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,591
and wondering what's
going to happen next.

741
00:33:52,591 --> 00:33:53,090
OK?

742
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:57,320
At least that's the problem
on the table for today.

743
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:02,840
OK, so a standard view
for a very long time

744
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,001
has been that different
mechanisms solve

745
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:07,250
these different aspects of
the problem of representing

746
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,080
objects.

747
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,159
That segmentation
depends on relatively

748
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,750
low-level mechanisms.

749
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:14,176
Completion and
identity through time,

750
00:34:14,176 --> 00:34:16,550
it's going to depend on how
much time we're talking about

751
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:18,860
and how complicated the
transformations are.

752
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,429
They're sort of in the middle.

753
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:24,320
And this is all about
reasoning, about concepts

754
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,300
that go beyond
perception altogether,

755
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,489
like the mass of an
object, which we can't

756
00:34:28,489 --> 00:34:31,944
see directly, and so forth.

757
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:33,860
And I kind of believed
that that was true when

758
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:36,150
we started doing this work.

759
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:39,210
And because I did and wanted to
know where the boundaries were

760
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:40,909
of what infants
could do, I started

761
00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:42,380
by working on these
problems here.

762
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,360
And that's what I'm going
to talk about today.

763
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,850
But let me flag at the
outset that I no longer

764
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:52,080
believe that the real
representations of objects that

765
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,210
organize infants' learning
about the physical world, I

766
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:57,380
no longer believe
that they're embodied

767
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,820
in a set of diverse systems.

768
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:02,110
I think there's a single system
that's ultimately at work here.

769
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,770
Of course it has
multiple levels to it,

770
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:06,090
including low-level of edge
detection, and so forth.

771
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:08,640
But that there's a single
system at work that both--

772
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,150
that tells us what's
connected to what

773
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,580
and where the
boundaries of things

774
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:15,880
are in arrays like this,
how things continue

775
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,520
where and when they're
hidden, and how they interact

776
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,330
with other things.

777
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:21,670
That's one unitary
system, and I'll

778
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:24,790
try to show you what
evidence supports

779
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:27,670
that view, though,
of course, jump

780
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:31,330
in with questions or criticisms
or alternative accounts.

781
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:35,860
OK, so here's an intermediate
case to start with.

782
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:40,150
You present a-- it was studied
a lot by Belgian psychologist

783
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:45,550
Elvin Meshot back in the 1950s,
I think-- '50s or early '60s.

784
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:49,390
Take a triangle, present
it behind an occluder,

785
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:55,450
and ask babies, in effect, what
do you see in that triangle?

786
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:57,880
Do you see a connected
object or do you see

787
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,252
two separate visible fragments?

788
00:36:00,252 --> 00:36:01,960
We did these studies
with four-month-olds

789
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,751
because they're not
yet reaching for things

790
00:36:03,751 --> 00:36:05,470
and manipulating objects.

791
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:07,120
We used the fact that
they tend to like

792
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,620
to look at things that are new.

793
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:11,590
So we presented this display
repeatedly-- we, by the way,

794
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:14,230
is Phil Kellman, now
at UCLA and studying

795
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:16,030
all this stuff in
adults primarily, also

796
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:18,130
studying mathematics now.

797
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:22,390
Anyhow, so we presented
displays like this repeatedly

798
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:24,640
to babies until they
got bored with them.

799
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,670
And then we took the occluder
away and in alternation,

800
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:29,680
presented them with
a complete triangle

801
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,302
and with a triangle that
had a gap in the center.

802
00:36:32,302 --> 00:36:34,510
And we reasoned that there
were two possible outcomes

803
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:35,650
of the study.

804
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:41,290
Possibility one is that as
empiricists and the then-very

805
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:43,930
influential child psychologist--

806
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:46,030
developmental
psychologist Jean Piaget

807
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:48,970
argued, for a four-month-old
infant who isn't yet

808
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:50,710
reaching for
things, the world is

809
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:53,200
an array of visible fragments.

810
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,840
So they will see
this thing as ending

811
00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:00,250
at this edge where the occluder
begins, and this display will

812
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,180
look more similar to
them than this display,

813
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,444
so they'll be more
interested in that one.

814
00:37:04,444 --> 00:37:06,610
There was also the theory
from Gestalt psychologists

815
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:08,943
and others that predicted the
opposite, that there would

816
00:37:08,943 --> 00:37:11,050
be automatic completion
processes that

817
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:14,080
would lead any creature, whether
they were experienced or not,

818
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,870
to perceive the simpler
arrangement, which is this one.

819
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:19,330
Those, it seemed to us,
were the only two options.

820
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:20,921
Baby research is
really fun because it

821
00:37:20,921 --> 00:37:22,420
can surprise you
even when you think

822
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,800
you've covered all the bases.

823
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,000
Neither of those
turned out to be true.

824
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,690
What happened instead was that
when we took the occluder away,

825
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:30,880
you still saw an
increase in looking

826
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,790
both to the connected object
and to the separate object,

827
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:36,700
and those two
increases were equal.

828
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:39,610
Now, this could have been for
an extremely boring reason.

829
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:41,410
Maybe babies were
only paying attention

830
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:44,450
to the thing that was
closest to them in the array.

831
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:47,740
So we very quickly tested for
that in the following way.

832
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:51,160
Instead of contrasting an array
with a small gap to an array

833
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,590
that had it filled in,
we contrasted an array

834
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:55,900
with a small gap to an
array with a larger gap,

835
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,000
too large to have fit
behind the occluder.

836
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,190
And there, babies looked
longer at the array

837
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,510
with the larger gap.

838
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,250
So we know it's not
that they're not

839
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:06,790
seeing this back form
and its visible surfaces,

840
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:09,730
but they seem to be uncommitted
as to whether those surfaces

841
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:11,957
are connected behind
the occluder or not.

842
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:14,290
They don't see them as ending
where the occluder begins,

843
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:16,569
but they don't clearly see
them as connected, either.

844
00:38:16,569 --> 00:38:18,610
And we showed that this
was quite generally true,

845
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:21,580
both for simpler arrays and
for more complicated-- well,

846
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:23,905
for richer ones, like a sphere.

847
00:38:23,905 --> 00:38:25,780
We did this with a bunch
of different arrays.

848
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,520
And under these
conditions, where

849
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,136
the arrays are stationary,
that's what we found.

850
00:38:30,136 --> 00:38:31,510
But there was one
condition where

851
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:33,093
we got a different
finding, and that's

852
00:38:33,093 --> 00:38:35,200
when we took one of
these arrays and moved it

853
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,780
behind the occluder, never
moving it enough to bring

854
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:40,330
the center into view,
but moving it enough such

855
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:42,696
that the top and bottom
were moving together.

856
00:38:42,696 --> 00:38:44,320
And when we did that,
now babies looked

857
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,000
longer at the display
that had the gap.

858
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,900
That raised the question, why
is motion having this effect?

859
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,830
And the immediate
possibility, we thought,

860
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:56,830
is motion is calling their
attention to the rod,

861
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:59,020
so they're tending to it
more than they otherwise

862
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:01,810
would, and it's leading them
to see its other properties,

863
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:04,940
like the alignment of its edges.

864
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:09,340
So to test that, we gave them
misaligned objects differing

865
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,810
in color, differing in texture.

866
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:12,490
All of the edges--
none of the edges

867
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:14,277
were aligned with each other.

868
00:39:14,277 --> 00:39:16,360
If motion was just calling
attention to alignment,

869
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,980
it shouldn't do
that in this case.

870
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:22,210
But in fact, we found that
after getting bored with that,

871
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:24,970
infants expected something like
this, not something like that.

872
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:27,215
They looked longer at
the display with the gap.

873
00:39:27,215 --> 00:39:28,840
So it looks like the
motion is actually

874
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:32,530
providing the information
for the connectedness,

875
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:36,476
and the alignment is not
playing much of a role at all.

876
00:39:36,476 --> 00:39:37,850
Now, what could
be going on here?

877
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:39,040
This is the kind
of thing I think

878
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,510
that Josh likes to call a
suspicious coincidence, right?

879
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:44,080
That an infant is
looking at this array,

880
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,120
and isn't it odd that
we're seeing this--

881
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,740
I'm seeing the same
pattern of motion

882
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:50,930
below the occluder as
I'm seeing above it?

883
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,170
Now that could be two
separate objects that

884
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:55,630
just happen to be
moving together,

885
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:57,490
but that would be
rather unlikely.

886
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:59,680
You're much more likely
to see a pattern like that

887
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,840
if in fact there's a between it
and it's just one object that's

888
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,369
in motion.

889
00:40:03,369 --> 00:40:04,910
I think that's
probably the right way

890
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:08,880
to think about what's going
on in these experiments.

891
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,260
But if it is, notice
that not all coincidences

892
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:15,440
that are suspicious for us
are suspicious for infants.

893
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,330
For us, it's a
suspicious coincidence

894
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:19,550
that this edge is
aligned with that edge.

895
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,092
For infants, it's not.

896
00:40:21,092 --> 00:40:22,550
I think this is a
case where we can

897
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:25,520
see infants can be
useful for thinking

898
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,710
about our own
cognitive abilities

899
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:32,520
because they seem to share some
of our picture of the world,

900
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,440
but not all of our
picture of the world.

901
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,550
And that can be a hint as to how
that picture gets put together

902
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:39,180
and how it's organized.

903
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,537
So what kind of motion?

904
00:40:40,537 --> 00:40:42,120
We've tried a bunch
of different ones.

905
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,700
One of them is vertical motion.

906
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:47,330
That's interesting because
it's also a rigid displacement

907
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:48,500
or motion in depth.

908
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,830
They're both rigid displacements
in three-dimensional space.

909
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:54,110
Actually, all of
these three are.

910
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:56,480
But in this case, you don't
get any side-to-side changes

911
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,830
in the visual field.

912
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,010
I think I animated this.

913
00:40:59,010 --> 00:40:59,789
Yeah.

914
00:40:59,789 --> 00:41:01,580
So this is kind of what
the baby is seeing.

915
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:04,370
By the way, all of these studies
were done with real 3D objects

916
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:06,290
and they had textures
on them, and so forth.

917
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:08,090
They've also all
since been replicated

918
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:10,880
in other labs using computer
animated displays, which

919
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,180
we didn't have--

920
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,734
which weren't available
back in the day.

921
00:41:14,734 --> 00:41:16,400
And you get the same
result. So I'm just

922
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,020
doing cartoon
versions of them here,

923
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,600
but actually babies
showed these effects

924
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,176
across a range of
different displays.

925
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,300
So there's vertical motion.

926
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,287
Here is motion in depth.

927
00:41:25,287 --> 00:41:27,620
Oh, and by the way, we're not
restraining babies' heads,

928
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,578
so it's not going to be
anything near as, like,

929
00:41:29,578 --> 00:41:32,205
simple uniform as
what's at their eye,

930
00:41:32,205 --> 00:41:33,570
is what I'm showing here.

931
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:39,170
And then rotational motion,
like that, around the midpoint.

932
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:42,830
And what we found is that
babies used both vertical motion

933
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:46,070
and motion in depth
about as well as they

934
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:50,000
used horizontal motion to
perceive the connectedness

935
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,870
of the object.

936
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:53,300
They did not use rotary motion.

937
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:56,810
So I know there's a lot of
interest and projects focused

938
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:58,550
on perceptual invariance.

939
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,560
And I think there's an
interesting puzzle here,

940
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,976
and it's one that Molly is
very interested in, in the work

941
00:42:02,976 --> 00:42:05,030
that she's doing on geometry.

942
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:08,510
These are all rigid motions.

943
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:11,300
But somehow, rotation seems
to be a whole lot harder

944
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:17,210
for young intelligent beings
to wrap their heads around

945
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:20,690
than translation is--

946
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:23,660
including translation in
depth or vertical translation.

947
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:26,970
There's something hard
about orientation changes.

948
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:29,440
And in fact, I think they
remain hard for us as adults.

949
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,320
If you think of things like
how the shape of a square

950
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:36,500
seems to change if you rotate
it 45 degrees so it's a diamond.

951
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,221
It's no longer obvious that
it's got four right angles.

952
00:42:39,221 --> 00:42:40,970
There's something about
orientation that's

953
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:42,720
harder than these other things.

954
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,170
And I think we were
seeing that here.

955
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:48,020
When an object-- when a baby
is sitting still and a rod

956
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:49,610
is moving behind
an occluder, it's

957
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:52,370
moving both relative to
the baby and relative

958
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:54,260
to the surroundings,
which of those things

959
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,650
matters to the baby?

960
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:59,360
So Phil Kellman did the
ambitious experiment

961
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,590
of putting a baby
in a movable chair

962
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:03,980
and moving the baby
back and forth.

963
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:08,000
In one condition, the baby is
looking at a stationary rod,

964
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,360
but his own motion is such
that if you put a camera where

965
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:14,060
the baby's head is, you'll see
the image of that rod moving

966
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:16,640
back and forth behind the block.

967
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,530
In the other condition,
the motion of the rod

968
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:20,060
is tied to the
motion of the baby,

969
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:22,880
so it's always staying in
the middle of the baby's

970
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,500
visual field, but it's actually
moving through the array.

971
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,700
And it turned out that it's--

972
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:32,870
OK, so whether the baby
was still or moving

973
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:34,350
didn't matter at all.

974
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:36,980
So if the object is--
sorry, I did these wrong.

975
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:39,020
This should be still,
that should be moving.

976
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:42,620
If the object is still, and
whether the baby is still

977
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,180
or moving, it doesn't work.

978
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:45,680
If the object is moving--

979
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,850
the diagram is right.

980
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:48,770
It was just my
label that's wrong.

981
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:50,240
If the object is
moving, it doesn't

982
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,365
matter whether it's being
displaced in the infant's

983
00:43:52,365 --> 00:43:53,540
visual field or not.

984
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,590
It's seen as moving.

985
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,930
Now, this isn't magic.

986
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:58,806
The studies are not
being done in a dark room

987
00:43:58,806 --> 00:44:01,013
with a single luminous object
where the baby wouldn't

988
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:01,700
be able to tell.

989
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:04,100
There's lots of surround--
it's in a puppet stage

990
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,520
and that is stationary.

991
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,730
So there's lots of information
for the object moving

992
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:10,220
relative to its
surroundings in all

993
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,950
of the conditions of this study,
and I'm sure that's critical.

994
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:15,410
But for the point of view
of the infant's connecting

995
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:16,994
of the visible
ends of the object,

996
00:44:16,994 --> 00:44:18,410
the question he's
trying to answer

997
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:20,150
is, is that thing moving?

998
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:25,040
Not, am I experiencing movement
in this changing scene?

999
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:25,970
Retinal movement.

1000
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:29,180
So if it's the case that--

1001
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:31,640
what those last
findings suggest is

1002
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:38,480
that the input representations
to the system that's

1003
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,170
forming objects out of
arrays of visual surfaces

1004
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:46,160
already capture a lot of the 3D
spatial structure of the world.

1005
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,270
This is a relatively
late process.

1006
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:52,370
And it allows us to ask, is
it even specific to vision?

1007
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:54,560
Would we see the
same process at work

1008
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:58,520
if we presented babies with the
task of asking, am I feeling--

1009
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:02,270
are two things that are
moving in the world connected?

1010
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:05,480
Or are they not, in areas
that I'm not perceiving?

1011
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:08,480
We can ask that in
other modalities.

1012
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,110
So we did a series of studies--
this is with Arlette Streri.

1013
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:14,450
We did a series of studies
looking at perception

1014
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:16,580
of objects by active touch.

1015
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:21,000
By taking four-month-old babies
and putting a bib over them.

1016
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,950
Now I said they can't
reach for objects,

1017
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:25,640
but if you put a ring in a
baby's hand, even a newborn's

1018
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,080
hand, they'll grasp it.

1019
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,060
So we put rings in
their two hands.

1020
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:31,750
And in one condition, the
rings were rigidly attached,

1021
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:34,250
although the array was set up
so that they couldn't actually

1022
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:37,557
feel that attachment and
they couldn't see anything,

1023
00:45:37,557 --> 00:45:39,140
about the object,
anyway, because they

1024
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:42,280
had the screen blocking them.

1025
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,050
But as they moved one, the other
would move rigidly with it.

1026
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:47,300
In the other condition,
the two were unconnected,

1027
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,250
so they would move
independently.

1028
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:55,020
And after babies explored that
for-- over a series of trials,

1029
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,990
and as in the other
studies, we then

1030
00:45:56,990 --> 00:45:59,520
presented visual
arrays in alternation

1031
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,540
where the two rings
were connected or not.

1032
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:05,270
And found that in the condition
where they had moved rigidly

1033
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:07,640
together, infants
extrapolated a connection

1034
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,719
and looked longer at the
arrays that were not connected.

1035
00:46:10,719 --> 00:46:12,510
In the case where they
moved independently,

1036
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:14,360
they did the opposite.

1037
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,610
Now, that doesn't
tell us that there is

1038
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:18,770
a single system at work here.

1039
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:23,709
It could be that there
are, as Shimon, I believe,

1040
00:46:23,709 --> 00:46:25,250
was saying yesterday
afternoon, there

1041
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:26,702
are redundancies in the system.

1042
00:46:26,702 --> 00:46:28,160
You have different
systems that are

1043
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,570
capturing the same property.

1044
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:30,840
That's still true.

1045
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,060
But here's a reason to--

1046
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:36,120
we went on to ask not
only what infants can do,

1047
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,340
but what they can't do.

1048
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:39,350
And I think it gives us
reason to take seriously

1049
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:41,090
the possibility that
there's actually

1050
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:43,220
a single system at work here.

1051
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:45,320
What we did-- I haven't
pictured it here--

1052
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:48,620
is, instead of varying the
motion of the things, we did

1053
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:52,110
vary their motion, but we also
varied their other properties.

1054
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:53,780
So their rigidity.

1055
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:55,940
We contrasted a ring
that was made out

1056
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:57,620
of wood with a ring
that was made out

1057
00:46:57,620 --> 00:47:00,440
of some kind of spongy,
foam-rubbery material--

1058
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:04,220
their shape, their
surface texture.

1059
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:07,160
Asking, do infants take
account of those properties

1060
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,464
in extrapolating a connection?

1061
00:47:08,464 --> 00:47:10,130
Are they more likely
to think two things

1062
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:11,540
are connected to each
other if they're both

1063
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:12,920
made of foam rubber
than if one of them

1064
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,128
is made of foam rubber and
the other is made of wood?

1065
00:47:15,128 --> 00:47:17,600
We never found any effect
of those properties,

1066
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,900
just as we didn't
in the visual case.

1067
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:24,050
So we see not only the same
abilities, but the same limits.

1068
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:25,850
And while that's
not conclusive, I

1069
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:29,290
think it adds weight
to the idea that what

1070
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:32,990
we could be studying here-- we
started in the visual modality.

1071
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:35,390
But what we could
be studying here

1072
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:38,660
is something that's more
general and more abstract.

1073
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:42,316
Basic notions about how objects
behave that apply not only

1074
00:47:42,316 --> 00:47:44,690
when you're looking at things,
but when you're actively--

1075
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:46,898
when you're feeling them,
actively manipulating them,

1076
00:47:46,898 --> 00:47:50,800
exploring them in
other modalities.

1077
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,750
So I put a question mark because
it's not absolutely conclusive,

1078
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:56,810
but I think we should take
seriously that possibility.

1079
00:47:56,810 --> 00:47:57,770
OK.

1080
00:47:57,770 --> 00:47:58,460
Only motion.

1081
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:01,100
Is motion the only
thing that works?

1082
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:07,580
Or will other changes work, so
if an object changes in color?

1083
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:11,720
We created a particularly
exciting color change

1084
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:14,480
by embedding colored
lights within a glass rod

1085
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,190
so it's flashing on and off.

1086
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:19,090
Succeeded in eliciting very
high interest in that array.

1087
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:21,620
Babies looked at
it for a long time,

1088
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:23,960
but only the motion array
was seen as connected

1089
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,100
behind the occluder.

1090
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:29,540
So it looks like not all
changes elicit this perception.

1091
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:32,420
It's an open question what the
class of effective changes is.

1092
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:34,490
Maybe it's broader
than just motions,

1093
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:37,220
but it doesn't seem
like all changes work.

1094
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:41,780
Finally, is motion
the only variable

1095
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:44,420
that influences
infants' perception

1096
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:47,060
of-- the only property of
surfaces that influences

1097
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:49,250
infants' perception of objects?

1098
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:51,830
The answer to that
seems to be no.

1099
00:48:51,830 --> 00:48:55,340
So we studied that in
a different situation

1100
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:58,370
for which this is just a
very impoverished cartoon.

1101
00:48:58,370 --> 00:49:00,980
We took two block-like objects--

1102
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:03,080
of different colors and
textures in some studies,

1103
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,760
same color and
texture in others.

1104
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,230
It didn't matter.

1105
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:08,840
And put one on top of the
other and either presented

1106
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:13,040
them moving together
or moving separately.

1107
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,630
And then tested whether babies
represented them as connected

1108
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:17,547
in either of two ways.

1109
00:49:17,547 --> 00:49:19,254
Some of the studies
were done with babies

1110
00:49:19,254 --> 00:49:20,480
who were old enough to reach.

1111
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,100
And then we could ask,
are they reaching for it

1112
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:23,990
as if it were a single
body or as if there

1113
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:26,117
were two distinct bodies there?

1114
00:49:26,117 --> 00:49:27,950
I could give you more
information about that

1115
00:49:27,950 --> 00:49:29,157
if you're interested.

1116
00:49:29,157 --> 00:49:30,740
The other was with
looking time, where

1117
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:34,550
we had a hand come out and
grasp the top of the top object

1118
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:35,154
and lift it.

1119
00:49:35,154 --> 00:49:37,070
And the question is,
what should come with it?

1120
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:38,861
Will the bottom object
come with it as well

1121
00:49:38,861 --> 00:49:41,720
or will the top
object on its own?

1122
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,820
When the things had
previously moved together,

1123
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:45,554
they expected it all
to move together.

1124
00:49:45,554 --> 00:49:46,970
When they'd moved
separately, they

1125
00:49:46,970 --> 00:49:52,170
expected only the top
object would move by itself.

1126
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:54,140
And when there was
no motion at all,

1127
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:56,360
findings vary somewhat
from one lab to another,

1128
00:49:56,360 --> 00:50:00,130
but mostly they tend to be
ambiguous in the case where

1129
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:01,090
there's no motion.

1130
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:03,590
So there it looks like
motion is doing all the work.

1131
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:05,680
But if you make one simple
change to this array

1132
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,810
that you can't do in
the occlusion studies,

1133
00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:10,420
you simply change the
size of this object

1134
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:13,356
and present it such that there's
a gap between the two objects.

1135
00:50:13,356 --> 00:50:15,730
And you can either do it with
this guy floating magically

1136
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:17,771
in midair, or you can do
it with two objects side

1137
00:50:17,771 --> 00:50:20,560
by side, both stably
supported by a surface.

1138
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,600
If there's a visible
gap between them,

1139
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:23,920
the motion no longer matters.

1140
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,440
They will be treated as
two distinct objects,

1141
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,510
no matter what.

1142
00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:30,490
So what I think is
going on here is

1143
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:33,220
that babies have a
system that's seeking

1144
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:36,610
to find the connected, the
solid connected bodies.

1145
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:39,550
The bodies that are
internally connected and will

1146
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:44,350
remain so over motion.

1147
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:46,390
And that's what's
leading them to see

1148
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:52,630
these patterns of relative
motion or these visible gaps

1149
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:57,880
as indicating a place where one
object ends and the next object

1150
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:58,630
begins.

1151
00:50:58,630 --> 00:51:02,560
I did want to get on to the
problem of tracking objects

1152
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:06,800
over time, perceiving not what's
connected to what over space,

1153
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,149
but what's connected
to what over time.

1154
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:11,440
Under what conditions are
the thing that I'm seeing now

1155
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,660
the same thing that I
was seeing at some place

1156
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:17,050
or time in the past?

1157
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:24,220
So conceptually, it feels like
continuity of motion over time

1158
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:28,210
is related to connectedness
of motion over space.

1159
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:30,820
And it's been tested for
in a variety of ways.

1160
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:32,500
Here's one set of
studies that we

1161
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:35,190
did, where we have an
object that moves behind

1162
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:39,040
a single screen, and then
either is-- and it starts here,

1163
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:39,790
ends up here.

1164
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:42,280
And either is seen to move
between the two screens

1165
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:44,770
or is not.

1166
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:47,800
And we ask babies
in effect, how many

1167
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,810
objects do they think
are in this display,

1168
00:51:49,810 --> 00:51:51,430
by boring half the
babies with this,

1169
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:53,740
half the babies with that,
and then presenting them

1170
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:55,360
in alternation
with arrays of one

1171
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,310
versus two objects,
neither of which

1172
00:51:57,310 --> 00:52:00,070
ever passes through the
center, but the arrays

1173
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:00,926
differ in number.

1174
00:52:00,926 --> 00:52:02,800
In the one case, it's
either moving over here

1175
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,420
or it's moving over there
on different trials.

1176
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:09,610
And what we find is
that in this case,

1177
00:52:09,610 --> 00:52:12,790
they expect to see one object
and look longer at two.

1178
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:15,610
In this case, they
expect to see two objects

1179
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:17,134
and look somewhat longer at one.

1180
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:19,550
There's actually an overall
preference for looking at two,

1181
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:21,790
but you get that
interaction and there's

1182
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:26,950
a slight preference for looking
at one in that condition.

1183
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:28,990
Providing evidence,
I think, that babies

1184
00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:33,730
are tracking objects over
time by analyzing information

1185
00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:35,730
for the continuity of--

1186
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:38,890
or discontinuity of
their object motion.

1187
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:40,810
Now, Lisa Feigenson
has conducted

1188
00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:43,655
stronger tests of this, I think,
with somewhat older babies.

1189
00:52:43,655 --> 00:52:45,280
When babies get older
and they do more,

1190
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,657
you can do stronger tests.

1191
00:52:47,657 --> 00:52:49,240
So these are babies
who are old enough

1192
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:52,930
to crawl, old enough
to eat, and old enough

1193
00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:55,600
to like graham crackers.

1194
00:52:55,600 --> 00:53:00,010
So she puts the baby back here,
and in one set of studies,

1195
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:04,000
she takes a single graham
cracker, puts it in one box,

1196
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,850
and then takes two graham
crackers, one at a time,

1197
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:09,280
and puts them in the other box.

1198
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,520
And then the baby, who's
being restrained by a parent,

1199
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:13,330
is let loose.

1200
00:53:13,330 --> 00:53:15,430
And the question is,
which box will they go to?

1201
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:18,550
And they go to the box with
the two graham crackers.

1202
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:22,390
My favorite study, though,
in this whole series

1203
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:27,220
was one that she and Susan
Carey ran as a boring control

1204
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:27,760
condition.

1205
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,843
I think it's the most
interesting of the findings,

1206
00:53:29,843 --> 00:53:30,360
though.

1207
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:31,870
In the boring control
condition, they

1208
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:33,911
were worried about the
fact that maybe babies are

1209
00:53:33,911 --> 00:53:35,860
going to the box
with two because they

1210
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:38,800
see a hand around that box
for a longer period of time,

1211
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,850
doing more interesting stuff.

1212
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:42,700
So they did the
following boring control.

1213
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:44,780
The two condition was
the same as before.

1214
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:46,990
So a hand comes out with
a single graham cracker,

1215
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:49,240
puts it in the box,
comes out empty,

1216
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,730
takes a second graham cracker,
returns with a second graham

1217
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:53,520
cracker, puts it in the box.

1218
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,660
In the other condition,
the hand comes out

1219
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:58,330
with one graham cracker,
puts it in the box,

1220
00:53:58,330 --> 00:54:01,360
comes out again with
the graham cracker,

1221
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:04,360
and then goes back into the
box with that graham cracker.

1222
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:08,470
So you've got more graham
cracker sightings on the left.

1223
00:54:08,470 --> 00:54:12,490
You've got a same amount of
hand activity on the two sides,

1224
00:54:12,490 --> 00:54:14,824
but the babies go
to the box with two.

1225
00:54:14,824 --> 00:54:16,990
They're tracking the graham
crackers, not the graham

1226
00:54:16,990 --> 00:54:19,570
cracker visual encounters.

1227
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:24,910
They're tracking a
continuous object over time.

1228
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:28,690
Finally, objects.

1229
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:30,760
Scenes don't
usually just contain

1230
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:36,550
a single object that's either
connected, continuously visible

1231
00:54:36,550 --> 00:54:39,100
or not, or connected or not.

1232
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:41,560
They contain multiple objects
and those objects interact

1233
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,190
with each other.

1234
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:46,180
Shimon talked yesterday
afternoon about the evidence

1235
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:48,490
that babies are sensitive
to these interactions,

1236
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:52,930
at least down to about six
months of age in the conditions

1237
00:54:52,930 --> 00:54:54,190
he was talking about.

1238
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:56,500
In slightly
different conditions,

1239
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,570
the sensitivity has
been shown as young

1240
00:54:58,570 --> 00:55:00,859
as three months of age.

1241
00:55:00,859 --> 00:55:02,900
Basically, here's a paradigm
that will show that,

1242
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:05,780
if you have a single object
that's moving toward a screen.

1243
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:08,250
Another object is stationary
behind the screen.

1244
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:11,480
But at the right time, the
time at which this object,

1245
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:14,060
if it continued moving at
the same rate, at the point

1246
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:15,890
where it would
contact that object,

1247
00:55:15,890 --> 00:55:18,820
this object starts to move
in the same direction.

1248
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:21,080
And now, after seeing
that repeatedly,

1249
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:23,000
the screen is taken
away and babies either

1250
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,640
see the first object contacting
the second and the second one

1251
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:27,560
immediately starting
to move, or they

1252
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:29,120
see the first object
stopping short

1253
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:31,250
of the second an
appropriate gap in time,

1254
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:33,170
and then the second
object starts to move.

1255
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:35,750
And they look longer
at this display,

1256
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:38,850
providing evidence
that they inferred

1257
00:55:38,850 --> 00:55:41,720
that the first object contacted
the second at the point

1258
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:45,860
at which it started to move.

1259
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:50,630
Interestingly, as in the case
of the occluded object studies,

1260
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:53,330
if instead of having
the second object move,

1261
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:57,080
you have it change
color and make a sound,

1262
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:59,960
so it undergoes a change
in state, but no motion,

1263
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:04,170
the babies no longer infer
contact in this condition.

1264
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:05,750
They are attentive
to those events.

1265
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:08,240
They watch them a
lot, but they're

1266
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,490
uncommitted as to
whether that first

1267
00:56:10,490 --> 00:56:13,040
object-- this is work of Paul
Muentener and Susan Carey

1268
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,245
relatively recently.

1269
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:15,620
It wasn't done
with cylinders, it

1270
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:19,790
was done with a toy
car that hits a block,

1271
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:22,760
I think, or doesn't
hit the block.

1272
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:25,550
They're uncommitted as to
whether the car contacted

1273
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:27,830
the second object or
not, if the second object

1274
00:56:27,830 --> 00:56:30,200
changes state but doesn't move.

1275
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:32,540
Returning to the case
where they succeed--

1276
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:35,810
namely, this thing went behind a
screen, the other thing started

1277
00:56:35,810 --> 00:56:42,610
to move, infants inferred
that they came into contact--

1278
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:46,430
that begins to suggest that
maybe babies have some notion

1279
00:56:46,430 --> 00:56:48,440
that objects are solid,
that two things can't

1280
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,340
be in the same place
at the same time,

1281
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:53,420
that when one moving thing
hits another thing, one

1282
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:56,330
or the other of them or both,
their motion has to change,

1283
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:58,790
because they're not going
to simply interpenetrate

1284
00:56:58,790 --> 00:56:59,660
each other.

1285
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:02,900
And Josh already
very briefly pointed

1286
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:08,690
to some very old studies
suggesting that babies have--

1287
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:12,860
make some assumption that
objects are solid as early as--

1288
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:15,380
I think in the
earliest studies done

1289
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:18,590
with babies it's about two
and a half months of age.

1290
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:21,100
These are these studies
that Renee Baillargeon did

1291
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:25,400
that start with simply
a screen, a flat screen,

1292
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:28,790
rotating on a table, rotating
180 degrees back and forth

1293
00:57:28,790 --> 00:57:29,990
on a table.

1294
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:34,550
Then she places an
object behind this wall.

1295
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:36,920
The screen is lying on the
table with its back edge

1296
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,030
right here at the middle.

1297
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:41,060
She places an object behind
it, and then the screen

1298
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:44,076
starts to rotate up
around the back edge

1299
00:57:44,076 --> 00:57:45,950
and the question to the
infants in effect is,

1300
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:48,680
what should happen
to that screen?

1301
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:50,570
And the two options
she presents to them

1302
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:52,970
is it either gets to the
point where it would contact

1303
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:55,820
this object which is
now fully out of view,

1304
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:59,030
and stops, and then returns
to its first position, which

1305
00:57:59,030 --> 00:58:01,700
is a novel motion,
but consistent

1306
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:04,580
with the existence,
location, and solidity

1307
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:06,950
of that hidden object.

1308
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:09,950
Or it continues merrily on
its way and the same pattern

1309
00:58:09,950 --> 00:58:11,474
of rotation as before.

1310
00:58:11,474 --> 00:58:12,890
When it does that,
of course, it's

1311
00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:14,540
going to come back
flat on the screen

1312
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:16,989
and there's not going
to be any object there.

1313
00:58:16,989 --> 00:58:18,530
If there had been
an object, it would

1314
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:19,700
have had to be compressed.

1315
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:22,140
Or what I think actually
went on in those studies,

1316
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:24,800
it was quickly and
surreptitiously knocked out

1317
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,090
of the way.

1318
00:58:26,090 --> 00:58:31,290
And infants looked less at
this event than at this one--

1319
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:34,670
this one, sorry--
providing some evidence

1320
00:58:34,670 --> 00:58:37,610
that they were representing
these objects, both as

1321
00:58:37,610 --> 00:58:43,100
existing when they were
out of sight, and as solid.

1322
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:47,000
So this is just a summary,
not a claim about knowledge

1323
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,450
development, about--

1324
00:58:50,450 --> 00:58:53,090
I'm attempting to
characterize here

1325
00:58:53,090 --> 00:58:57,650
with motion over just one
dimension of space and time,

1326
00:58:57,650 --> 00:58:59,030
how infants seem--

1327
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:02,960
what infants seem to represent
about the behavior of objects.

1328
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:06,440
Namely that each object
moves on a continuous path

1329
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:08,300
through space and over time.

1330
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:09,650
That it moves cohesively.

1331
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:12,959
It doesn't split into
pieces as it's moving.

1332
00:59:12,959 --> 00:59:14,750
So if you've seen
something move like this,

1333
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:19,190
then you find it unlikely
that if this were lifted,

1334
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:21,710
it would go on its own, and
you look longer at that.

1335
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:23,840
There is no merging,
where two things that

1336
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:26,820
previously moved independently
now move together.

1337
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:28,640
So after looking at
this, it would also

1338
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,920
be unlikely, if you lifted
this, for the whole thing

1339
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:33,230
to jump up at once.

1340
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:34,430
They move without gaps.

1341
00:59:34,430 --> 00:59:36,650
They move without
intersecting other objects

1342
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:39,410
other objects on their paths
of motion, such that two things

1343
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:42,020
are in the same place
at the same time.

1344
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:45,440
And they move on contact
with other objects

1345
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:48,140
and not at a distance from them.

1346
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:51,350
So that's just a
summary of what I

1347
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:55,490
think these studies show about
four-month-old infants, not

1348
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:56,467
newborns.

1349
00:59:56,467 --> 00:59:58,550
They also show that infants'
perception of objects

1350
00:59:58,550 --> 01:00:00,340
is really limited.

1351
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:05,010
There's all these situations
under which we see unitary,

1352
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:07,620
connected, bounded
objects when they don't.

1353
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:12,360
And interestingly, research
by Fei Xu and Susan Carey

1354
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:17,220
shows that even when you present
really quite surprisingly

1355
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:21,660
old infants, 10-month-olds, with
objects that should be really

1356
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:25,200
familiar to them, like
toy ducks and trucks,

1357
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:28,620
they don't assume that these
two objects will be distinct

1358
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:31,380
if they undergo
no common motion.

1359
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:33,360
If they're simply
presented stationary,

1360
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:37,020
the babies seem uncommitted
as to whether there's

1361
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:38,910
a boundary between them or not.

1362
01:00:38,910 --> 01:00:40,980
So they're using very
limited information

1363
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:44,130
to be making these basic--

1364
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:45,870
building these basic
representations

1365
01:00:45,870 --> 01:00:48,390
of what's connected to
what, where one thing ends

1366
01:00:48,390 --> 01:00:51,240
and the next begins.

1367
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:55,080
Now, this changes very
abruptly between about 10

1368
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:56,160
and 12 months of age.

1369
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,860
They start treating those
as two separate objects,

1370
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:03,630
whether they're moving
together or stationary or not.

1371
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:05,160
Now, infants'
tracking of objects

1372
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:07,260
shows very similar limits.

1373
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:09,870
So I told you they
succeed in perceiving--

1374
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:11,430
representing two
distinct objects

1375
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:13,020
in a situation like this.

1376
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:15,930
But up until and including
10 months of age,

1377
01:01:15,930 --> 01:01:18,780
they fail in this situation.

1378
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:21,980
If a truck comes out on one
side of a single large screen,

1379
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:23,490
so you're not
getting information

1380
01:01:23,490 --> 01:01:25,890
for the motion
behind that screen,

1381
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:27,840
and a duck comes out
on the other side,

1382
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:30,990
and you ask babies, in effect,
how many things are there?

1383
01:01:30,990 --> 01:01:32,460
One or two?

1384
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:34,620
By removing the screen
and alternately presenting

1385
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:36,840
those two possibilities,
they are uncommitted

1386
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:39,780
between those two alternatives.

1387
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:42,240
In this situation as
in the previous one,

1388
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,850
there's this very abrupt
change between about 10

1389
01:01:44,850 --> 01:01:46,420
and 12 months of age.

1390
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:49,790
And I can't resist saying,
even though I'm way over time,

1391
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:54,180
that Fei Xu has shown that that
change is interestingly related

1392
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:57,870
to the child's developing
mastery of expressions

1393
01:01:57,870 --> 01:01:59,762
that name kinds of objects.

1394
01:01:59,762 --> 01:02:02,220
So she's been able to show,
for example, that if you simply

1395
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:06,420
ask for individual infants, when
did they start succeeding here,

1396
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:09,300
their success is predicted
by their vocabulary

1397
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:11,100
as reported by parents.

1398
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:14,580
She's also shown that
if you take a younger

1399
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:15,890
infant who would be slated--

1400
01:02:15,890 --> 01:02:19,620
destined to fail this study,
but as you bring objects

1401
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:23,160
out on the two sides, either
familiar ones or novel ones,

1402
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:24,990
starting at about
nine months of age,

1403
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:27,720
if you name them and you give
them distinct object names,

1404
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:29,310
they now infer two objects.

1405
01:02:29,310 --> 01:02:31,170
And in fact, they'll
even do it if the two

1406
01:02:31,170 --> 01:02:33,990
things you bring out from
behind a single wide screen

1407
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:35,130
look the same.

1408
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:37,620
If you bring one thing out
and say, look, a blicket,

1409
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:40,120
and put it back in, and then
bring something out and say,

1410
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:42,410
look, a toma, even
if it looks the same,

1411
01:02:42,410 --> 01:02:43,910
they'll infer two objects.

1412
01:02:43,910 --> 01:02:45,930
So there seems to be
this change that's

1413
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:48,270
occurring at the end
of the first year

1414
01:02:48,270 --> 01:02:51,030
quite dramatically that's
overcoming this basically meant

1415
01:02:51,030 --> 01:02:54,260
that we're seeing earlier on.
