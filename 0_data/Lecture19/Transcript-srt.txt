00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,910
MICHALE FEE: Today we're
going to continue developing

2
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,020
our equivalent circuit model,
the Hodgkin-Huxley model

3
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,610
of a neuron.

4
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,830
And we're still focusing
on the mechanism

5
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,450
that generates spikes.

6
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,750
As you recall, there
are two conductances,

7
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:36,260
iron conductances, that lead
to action potential generation.

8
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:40,080
There is sodium
conductance that is

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,400
connected to a sodium battery
that has a high equilibrium

10
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,320
potential.

11
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,310
There is a potassium
conductance that

12
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,250
is connected to a
potassium battery that

13
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,070
has a negative
equilibrium potential,

14
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,990
and those two
conductances together

15
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,640
have voltage and
time dependence that

16
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,850
lead to the generation
of a positive going,

17
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,540
followed by a negative going,
fluctuation in the voltage that

18
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,950
is the action potential.

19
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:08,520
And as you recall,
the way that happens,

20
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,940
there is a time dependence
to these conductances

21
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,650
so that when the sodium
conductance turns on,

22
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,170
this resistor gets really
small, and basically connects

23
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,870
the inside of the cell
to that positive battery.

24
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,600
When the sodium
conductance turns off

25
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,400
and the potassium
conductance turns on,

26
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,010
we're disconnecting
the sodium battery

27
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:28,060
and connecting the
potassium battery,

28
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,550
which has a negative voltage.

29
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,440
And the voltage
of the cell, then,

30
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,370
is driven toward the negative
potassium equilibrium

31
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,700
potential.

32
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:42,130
So last time we worked out the
voltage and time dependence

33
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:44,320
of the potassium conductance.

34
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,000
Today, we're going to focus
on the, sorry, focus here

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,330
on the sodium
conductance and explain

36
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:56,050
various aspects of the
voltage and time dependence

37
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:59,510
of the sodium conductance.

38
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:01,940
And then once we do
that, we're going

39
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,980
to turn in the second
half of the lecture

40
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:10,970
to a really beautiful, simple
model of a disease related

41
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:14,120
to a defect in the
sodium channel.

42
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,170
And it's an example of
how we can use modeling

43
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:24,430
to test and elaborate on
hypotheses about how defects

44
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,230
in a circuit, or
in an ion channel,

45
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:32,670
can lead to very complex
phenotypes in a whole animal.

46
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,300
So as you recall, our
Hodgkin-Huxley model

47
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:39,050
has three conductances
and a capacitance

48
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,780
that represents a capacitor
that represents the capacitance

49
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,830
of the membrane.

50
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,170
The total membrane
ionic current is just

51
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:48,080
a sum of the sodium current,
the potassium current,

52
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,830
and this voltage independent,
time independent,

53
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:55,110
fixed leak current.

54
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,843
So the equation for
the membrane potential,

55
00:02:57,843 --> 00:03:00,010
the differential equation
for the membrane potential

56
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,970
in the Hodgkin-Huxley model,
is just a simple first order

57
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,440
linear differential
equation that

58
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:11,650
relates the membrane current
and the membrane potential.

59
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,240
So last time we described
a set of experiments

60
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,730
that were done by
Hodgkin and Huxley

61
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:21,120
to study the voltage
and time dependence

62
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,300
of these conductances
in the squid giant axon.

63
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,900
And as you remember,
this axon is very large.

64
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,000
It's 1 millimeter
in diameter, which

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,550
makes it very easy
to put wires into it,

66
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:35,280
and change the voltage, and
measure the currents, and so

67
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,840
on.

68
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,020
So the experiment they did was
a voltage clamp experiment,

69
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,740
where you can hyperpolarize
and depolarize the cell.

70
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,930
There's a very fast
feedback system

71
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,600
that allows you to
set a command voltage,

72
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,080
and this operational amplifier
injects however much current

73
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,160
is needed to hold the cell at
whatever membrane potential you

74
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,820
command.

75
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,710
And the typical experiment
that they would do

76
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:01,260
would be to hyperpolarize
or depolarize

77
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,930
the cell to fixed
membrane potentials

78
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:08,310
and measure how much current
passes through the membrane

79
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:13,060
during and after that transient
change in the command voltage.

80
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,110
So if you take a
squid giant axon,

81
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:18,390
you start at minus
65 millivolts,

82
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:21,313
and you hyperpolarize the
cell, not much happens.

83
00:04:21,313 --> 00:04:22,980
And that's because
all of those currents

84
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:28,350
are already off when the cell
is hyperpolarize at minus 60

85
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,480
or at low voltages.

86
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,180
On the other hand, if you
start at minus 65 millivolts

87
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,560
and depolarize the cell up to 0
millivolts, all of a sudden you

88
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,190
see a very large
transient current

89
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:44,040
that first goes negative,
which corresponds

90
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,860
to positive charges going
into the cell followed

91
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,220
by a positive current
that's associated

92
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,440
with positive charges
leaving the cell.

93
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,720
And last time we
talked about how

94
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,810
we can dissect these two
phases of the current,

95
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,820
this negative phase and
this positive phase,

96
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:06,020
into two different
ionic conductances.

97
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,740
That they did that experiment
by replacing the sodium

98
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,400
in the extracellular
solution that the axon was

99
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,940
sitting in with a solution
that has no sodium in it.

100
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:20,090
They replaced that
with choline chloride.

101
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:24,030
So choline is a positive ionic--

102
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,220
has a positive charge
and chloride, of course,

103
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,490
has a negative charge.

104
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,240
And so you can replace
the sodium chloride

105
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,157
with choline chloride.

106
00:05:30,157 --> 00:05:32,480
And now, when you
depolarize your cell,

107
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,180
you can see that that
negative part is gone.

108
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,120
And the only current you
see is this positive--

109
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,170
this kind of slowly ramping
up positive current.

110
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:47,630
And they identified that as
being due to potassium ions.

111
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,752
And if you subtract
the current curve

112
00:05:49,752 --> 00:05:52,670
without sodium from the
current curve with sodium,

113
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:56,060
the difference is
obviously due to sodium.

114
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,490
And so if you plot the
difference between those two

115
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:02,900
curves, you can see that
the sodium current turns

116
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:09,680
on very rapidly and then
decays very rapidly,

117
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,930
that that transient
sodium current happens

118
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:15,410
very quickly, almost before
the potassium current even

119
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:17,730
gets started.

120
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:21,670
And we talked about how that
fast sodium current, followed

121
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:26,530
by a slower potassium current,
is exactly the profile,

122
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:31,980
that we showed here, that
generates depolarizing change

123
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:34,360
in the voltage followed
by a hyperpolarize change

124
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,146
in the voltage that looks
like an action potential.

125
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:43,910
So now, let's just
review quickly how

126
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:49,330
we took these current curves,
and from those, extracted

127
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:53,960
the conductance of the sodium
and potassium ion channels

128
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,020
as a function of
voltage and time.

129
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,720
So what we did was
we looked at the case

130
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,460
where we do our voltage
clamp experiment

131
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,660
to different voltages.

132
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,310
We start hyperpolarized.

133
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:08,930
We step up to minus 40 and
measure this potassium current.

134
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:13,040
We step up to 0, and you see
this larger potassium current.

135
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,560
If you step from
minus 40 to 40, you

136
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,660
see an even larger
potassium current.

137
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:23,360
And you can plot this peak
current, or the steady state

138
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,250
current, as a
function of voltage.

139
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,028
That gives you an I-V curve, and
we'll look at that in a second.

140
00:07:29,028 --> 00:07:31,070
If you do the same thing
for the sodium currents,

141
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:33,620
you see something
different that's

142
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,750
initially very confusing.

143
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,940
If you step from
minus 80 to minus 40,

144
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,760
you see a small sodium current.

145
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,310
If you make a larger
voltage step up to 0,

146
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:47,970
you see this bigger
sodium current.

147
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:51,030
But then if you step up
from minus 80 millivolts

148
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,980
to 40 millivolts, now
you see you just have

149
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,230
a tiny little sodium current.

150
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:57,870
Anybody remember
why that would be?

151
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,930
Why is it that you would
see only a very tiny sodium

152
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:04,517
current, if you step
up to 40 millivolts?

153
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:16,024
What is the equilibrium
potential for sodium?

154
00:08:16,024 --> 00:08:17,550
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

155
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,550
MICHALE FEE: Good, good.

156
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:21,790
So what would the
sodium current be

157
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:25,810
if I had stepped this voltage
up exactly to 50 millivolts?

158
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:26,592
AUDIENCE: 0.

159
00:08:26,592 --> 00:08:27,550
MICHALE FEE: It'd be 0.

160
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,530
So this is pretty
close to 50 millivolts,

161
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:35,080
which is why the sodium current
is actually pretty small.

162
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,940
So now, let's plot
the peak current

163
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:43,360
as a function of voltage for
potassium and the peak current

164
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,750
here as a function of
voltage for sodium.

165
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,080
That's what that looks like.

166
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,080
So you can see
that the potassium

167
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,800
current is 0 for these
voltages down here and grows.

168
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,030
It's actually stay 0 for
even more negative voltages.

169
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,660
The sodium current,
on the other hand,

170
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,400
has this very kind
of funny shape.

171
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,310
It's linear up here
around high voltages,

172
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:11,030
around the sodium equilibrium
or reversal potential,

173
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:14,650
and then at drops to 0.

174
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:19,540
The sodium current stays
at 0 for negative voltages.

175
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:23,200
And you recall that we use
this to think about what

176
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,550
the conductance must be.

177
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:29,450
So let me just walk you
through that logic again.

178
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:32,350
So remember that the current
is just a conductance

179
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,570
times the driving potential.

180
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:37,450
The driving
potential is positive

181
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,730
when you're above the
equilibrium potential,

182
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:43,270
and it's negative
when you're below.

183
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:46,090
So this term here
is a straight line.

184
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:49,660
It's linear in voltage,
and it goes through 0

185
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:53,050
when V is equal to EK.

186
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,800
So there is the driving
potential for potassium

187
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,770
as a function of voltage.

188
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:04,360
Now, you can see clearly
that the conductance

189
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,740
as a function of voltage
has some voltage dependence,

190
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,420
because this doesn't
look like this.

191
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,400
So the difference
between this and this

192
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,200
is captured by this
voltage-dependent conductance.

193
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,620
And does anyone remember what
that conductance, that GK

194
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,090
as a function of V, looks like?

195
00:10:28,042 --> 00:10:29,034
AUDIENCE: Sigmoidal.

196
00:10:29,034 --> 00:10:30,410
MICHALE FEE: Yeah, sigmoidal.

197
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:33,390
And what is it down here?

198
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,380
It's 0.

199
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,690
So the way that you
can get a 0 current,

200
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,910
even with a very negative
driving potential,

201
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:41,550
is if the conductance is 0.

202
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,890
You can see that the
current is linear up here,

203
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,810
and the driving potential
is linear up here.

204
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:49,720
So the conductance
has to be constant.

205
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,250
And so we have a
conductance that

206
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:56,820
has to be 0 down here and a
constant non-zero up here.

207
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,630
Yes?

208
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:00,325
AUDIENCE: So why is
the potassium curve

209
00:11:00,325 --> 00:11:04,090
0 when it's more
negative than GK?

210
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:07,890
Why doesn't it go in
the other direction?

211
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:11,375
MICHALE FEE: Why doesn't
this curve do something else?

212
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,500
So what is it that you're--

213
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,560
AUDIENCE: Like why doesn't
it-- why doesn't it--

214
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,700
MICHALE FEE: Why
doesn't it keep going?

215
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,325
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

216
00:11:15,325 --> 00:11:17,363
Why is there like a [INAUDIBLE]?

217
00:11:17,363 --> 00:11:18,030
MICHALE FEE: Ah.

218
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,580
Because-- OK.

219
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,580
That's a great question.

220
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:25,360
So maybe you can answer it.

221
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,700
How would I change
the conductance curve

222
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:34,130
to make this look
more like this?

223
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:38,060
I could do something very
simple to the voltage dependence

224
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,190
of the potassium
conductance to actually make

225
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,353
it look like that.

226
00:11:41,353 --> 00:11:42,020
What would I do?

227
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,940
The reason this goes
to 0 and stays at 0

228
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,910
is because the voltage
dependence of the conductance

229
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:03,110
turns it off before the driving
potential can go negative.

230
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:05,620
So what would I do
to the conductance

231
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:11,380
to make this current dip
below 0 before it comes back,

232
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:14,346
any suggestions?

233
00:12:14,346 --> 00:12:15,372
AUDIENCE: Translate it.

234
00:12:15,372 --> 00:12:16,580
MICHALE FEE: Yeah, which way?

235
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,450
AUDIENCE: This way.

236
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:18,590
MICHALE FEE: Good, exactly.

237
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:22,010
So if I took this curve
and I shifted it that way,

238
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:25,100
if I made the potassium
conductance turn off

239
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:29,930
at a more negative
potential, then this

240
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:33,405
would go down before it got
turned off by the conductance.

241
00:12:33,405 --> 00:12:34,280
Does that make sense?

242
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,730
Great question.

243
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,830
Any other questions?

244
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,770
So the answer is, the reason
this doesn't go negative

245
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:44,260
is because the voltage
dependence of the potassium

246
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:47,380
conductance turns
off the conductance

247
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:51,760
before or on the positive
side of the equilibrium

248
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,262
potential of potassium.

249
00:12:55,262 --> 00:12:55,762
Yes?

250
00:12:55,762 --> 00:12:58,684
AUDIENCE: Can you explain
again why the [INAUDIBLE]??

251
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,510
MICHALE FEE: So if
G were constant,

252
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:08,570
if G had no voltage dependence
and it was just a constant,

253
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:11,140
what would this
current look like?

254
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,230
What would it look like?

255
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:21,760
If this G were just a constant,
no dependent on voltage?

256
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

257
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,430
MICHALE FEE: Good.

258
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:27,870
It would look just
like this, right?

259
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:31,950
So the reason this curve
shuts off and goes to 0

260
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:36,790
is that the conductance
goes to 0 down here,

261
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,450
and it's constant up here.

262
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,780
Does that make sense?

263
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,120
And that curve just
looks like that.

264
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,000
It's 0 down here and
constant up here.

265
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,210
Good question.

266
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:51,790
Any other?

267
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,350
There was another hand up here.

268
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:53,480
Yeah?

269
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,188
AUDIENCE: I was
wondering about notation.

270
00:13:55,188 --> 00:13:57,643
So it's GK of V. It's not
like GK times V, right?

271
00:13:57,643 --> 00:13:58,310
MICHALE FEE: No.

272
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:03,180
It's GK as a function
of V. Yeah, that's--

273
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:07,250
the notation is sometimes
a little bit confusing.

274
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,275
You kind of have to read
it out from the context.

275
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,360
Any other questions?

276
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,720
So now you can see why this
curve looks the way it does.

277
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:29,370
So now, let's plot the driving
potential, V minus Ena.

278
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,770
That's this curve right here.

279
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:36,130
It's Ohm's law, but it has a
battery that makes it centered.

280
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:40,920
It makes it give 0 current
when V is equal to Ena,

281
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,810
which is positive.

282
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,790
So that's why that
curve looks like that.

283
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:47,100
And what is it that
makes the sodium

284
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,770
current go to 0 down here?

285
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:56,220
It must be that the what?

286
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,304
What about the conductance?

287
00:14:59,304 --> 00:15:00,190
AUDIENCE: Turns off.

288
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:00,940
MICHALE FEE: Good.

289
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,130
The conductance, the
sodium conductance,

290
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:05,890
has to turn off down here.

291
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:07,060
And what about up here?

292
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,600
This is linear.

293
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,600
This is linear, so
the sodium conductance

294
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,770
has to be what up here?

295
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,680
Constant, good.

296
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,530
So you can see that
the sodium conductance

297
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:23,650
has exactly the same shape
as the potassium conductance.

298
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:26,275
It's not exactly at the same
voltage, but it's close.

299
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,610
Good.

300
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,290
So now you can see
where this kind

301
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:36,070
of weird shape of these
sodium and potassium currents

302
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:36,610
comes from.

303
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,300
It's actually very simple.

304
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,550
It's just a resistor in series
with a battery that gives you

305
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:47,470
this driving potential
offset from 0,

306
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:51,130
and that's multiplied by this
voltage-dependent conductance.

307
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:59,650
Now, the time dependence
of the conductance

308
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,420
is entirely due-- sorry.

309
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,220
The time dependence
of the current,

310
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:06,280
that ramping up current
that turns on and then stays

311
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,950
constant for the
potassium, is entirely

312
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:13,570
due to the time dependence
of the potassium conductance.

313
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:16,870
So the potassium
conductance just turns on.

314
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,360
That process of the
conductance turning on

315
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,160
is called activation.

316
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,180
Same for the sodium--

317
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:27,380
the sodium conductance
turns on quickly.

318
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,730
That's called activation.

319
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:31,190
The sodium conductance
turns on very fast,

320
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:35,880
and the potassium
conductance turns on slowly.

321
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:40,350
Now, we talked about
how the voltage gates

322
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:45,700
work in our voltage-dependent
ion channel.

323
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:49,380
And the idea is that you
have some gating charges that

324
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,590
are literally charged
residues, charged amino acids,

325
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:55,160
in the protein.

326
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:59,400
When the membrane
potential is very negative,

327
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,410
when the cell is
at rest, you can

328
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,840
see that there's a large
electric field pointing

329
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:08,040
that way inside the membrane,
and that pushes the charges,

330
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,829
pushes those gating charges,
toward the inside of the cell,

331
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:14,490
and that closes the gate.

332
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:18,180
When you depolarize the
cell, this membrane potential

333
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:22,380
goes closer to 0, the
electric field drops,

334
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,000
and those gating
charges are no longer

335
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,349
being pushed into the cell.

336
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:28,250
And they relax back,
and the gate opens.

337
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,710
So that is the basic,
sort of a cartoon,

338
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:40,280
picture of the mechanism by
which voltage-dependent ion

339
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:45,280
channels acquire that
voltage dependence.

340
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,250
So remember, we
talked about how we

341
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,380
can model that time dependence.

342
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,600
We can model that
opened and closed

343
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:57,700
state of the ion channel as
two states, an open state

344
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,220
and a closed state, where
the probability, n, of being

345
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,603
in the open state, a
probability of 1 minus

346
00:18:02,603 --> 00:18:03,770
n being in the closed state.

347
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:06,010
Remember, this was
for one subunit.

348
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:08,470
For the potassium channel,
there are four subunits,

349
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:12,350
and all of them have to be open.

350
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,330
And we wrote down a
differential equation

351
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:18,560
for that gating variable, n.

352
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,750
There is an n infinity,
a steady state,

353
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,040
that's a function of voltage.

354
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:27,810
And remember, for the
potassium, n infinity

355
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:31,770
is negative down
here and increases

356
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:35,670
as a function of voltage
to get close to 1

357
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:41,970
at voltages above minus 50,
or somewhere between minus 50

358
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:44,700
and 0 millivolts,
that gating variable.

359
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,660
And the n infinity of
that gating variable, n,

360
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,600
goes from being very
small to being large.

361
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,000
Now, so that's potassium.

362
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,710
We went through that last time.

363
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:01,590
And now let's talk about sodium.

364
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:04,920
Sodium looks exactly the same.

365
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,200
The sodium conductance
can be modeled

366
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,840
as having two states, an open
state and a closed state.

367
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,270
Remember, we did
a patch recording

368
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,580
on a single sodium channel.

369
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,190
You could see that it flickers
back and forth between open

370
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,420
and closed.

371
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:22,710
So we can model that process
in exactly the same way

372
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:25,380
that we did for the
potassium conductance.

373
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,860
We have an open state, a
closed state, a probability, m,

374
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,160
of being in the open state.

375
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,390
So m is our gating
variable for--

376
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:36,750
our activation gating variable
for the sodium conductance.

377
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:40,080
Probability of being in a
closed state is 1 minus m.

378
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,380
There is that same kind of
differential equation for the m

379
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,080
gating variable,
and a m infinity

380
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,910
that has a voltage
dependence that

381
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:52,447
looks very much like the voltage
dependence of n infinity.

382
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:00,640
So so far, the sodium and
potassium conductances

383
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,680
look very similar.

384
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:09,910
They both have the same kind
of activation gating variable,

385
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:13,840
the same simple model for
how to turn on and turn off,

386
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,290
same differential
equation, same gating

387
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:20,500
variable that has this
sigmoidal dependence on voltage.

388
00:20:23,028 --> 00:20:24,070
Any questions about that?

389
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,270
So you remember
the way we thought

390
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,870
about the time
dependence of these

391
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:38,610
is we simply integrate
this differential

392
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:39,600
equation over time.

393
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,760
It's a first order linear
differential equation,

394
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,490
and you can think about
the n, the gating variable,

395
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:48,060
as always relaxing
exponentially toward whatever

396
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,060
n infinity is at that moment.

397
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:53,400
And n infinity is a
function of voltage,

398
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,980
and any time dependence
it gets comes

399
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,240
from changes in the voltage.

400
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:01,330
So we're going to simplify
things and just consider

401
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:04,417
piecewise constant
changes in the voltage.

402
00:21:04,417 --> 00:21:05,750
So let's do a simple experiment.

403
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:09,210
We're going to hyperpolarize
the voltage to minus 80.

404
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:13,700
What is n infinity going
to be, big or small?

405
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:25,306
Remember what n infinity looks
like is a function of voltage?

406
00:21:25,306 --> 00:21:26,170
AUDIENCE: Small.

407
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:26,950
MICHALE FEE: Good.

408
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:30,640
So at hyperpolarized voltages,
n infinity is going to be small,

409
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,070
and so is m infinity.

410
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:38,330
Those ion channels are closed
at hyperpolarize voltages.

411
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:42,436
So the gating variables
that represent

412
00:21:42,436 --> 00:21:45,970
what the probability is of being
open, those gating variables

413
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:51,310
are small when the voltage
is negative, very negative.

414
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,800
So then we're going to
step the voltage up.

415
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,400
And what is n
infinity going to do?

416
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,177
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

417
00:21:59,177 --> 00:22:01,260
MICHALE FEE: Anybody want
to just draw for me what

418
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,550
it's going to do in the air?

419
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,680
It starts out small.

420
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,740
So is it going to
ramp up slowly?

421
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,682
Is it going to jump up?

422
00:22:09,682 --> 00:22:10,890
Is it going to wiggle around?

423
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:12,500
What's it going to do?

424
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,720
So why is it--

425
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,220
so I have several
different answers.

426
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,530
I have some people saying
that it's going to ramp up.

427
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:22,350
I'm asking about M
infinity now, not n.

428
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:26,110
So how many people say it's
going to jump up suddenly?

429
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,032
OK, good.

430
00:22:27,032 --> 00:22:28,240
That's what it's going to do.

431
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,400
It's going to start
out at a small value

432
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:36,190
and jump up to a larger value
when you depolarize the cell.

433
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,286
And then what is n going to do?

434
00:22:38,286 --> 00:22:39,280
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

435
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:44,590
MICHALE FEE: Good. n is going to
start at some initial condition

436
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:48,820
and relax exponentially
toward n infinity.

437
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:51,990
And then when you turn
the voltage back down,

438
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:57,510
N infinity is going to
go from this large value

439
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:03,010
back down to a
small value, and n

440
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:06,100
is going to relax
exponentially to that smaller

441
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,630
value of n infinity.

442
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,300
Any questions about that?

443
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,500
We saw that last time.

444
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,470
Now, what is the
conductance going to do?

445
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:20,620
Where does the conductance
depend on n, anybody remember,

446
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,460
for potassium?

447
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,875
How many subunits are
there in a potassium?

448
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:30,500
AUDIENCE: Four.

449
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,360
MICHALE FEE: Four.

450
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,840
And so if the probability
that each one is open is n,

451
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,780
and there are four
independent, what's

452
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,510
the probability that they're
all going to be open?

453
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,410
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

454
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:42,310
MICHALE FEE: Good.

455
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:48,490
And so the conductance is going
to turn on as this relaxing

456
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:49,900
exponential to the fourth.

457
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:53,650
And it's going to have that
kind of gradual ramping up.

458
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:00,700
Good.

459
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:04,540
It looks exactly
the same for sodium.

460
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:09,010
So if you start hyperpolarized,
you depolarized the cell,

461
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:10,990
that m infinity is
going to start small,

462
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:14,220
it's going to jump
up to a high value.

463
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,140
M is going to start
small, and it's

464
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,510
going to relax exponentially
toward that higher

465
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:21,080
value of m infinity.

466
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,270
Now, anybody want to
guess at what the sodium

467
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:26,130
conductance will look like?

468
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,150
It's going to be some
function of m, right?

469
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:35,140
It turns out that it m cubed.

470
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,920
And the reason is
that even though there

471
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:48,360
are four things that
have to all be open,

472
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,430
they're not independent
of each other.

473
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:56,610
And so the exponent is not m
to the fourth, it's m cubed.

474
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:58,950
And Hodgkin and Huxley
figured that out simply

475
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:01,500
by plotting these
relaxing exponentials

476
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,050
to different powers.

477
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:07,650
I imagine them saying,
oh, the potassium is 4.

478
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:10,230
Let's take m to the 4.

479
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:11,370
But it didn't fit.

480
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:14,720
So they tried some other, and
they found that m cubed fits.

481
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,830
So that's it.

482
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:24,310
Now, the problem with
this model is what?

483
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,850
What is the problem
with this model?

484
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:28,070
Is that when you
depolarize the cell,

485
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,990
the potassium current turns on.

486
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:35,090
The potassium conductance turns
on, but then what happens?

487
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:36,230
What is-- sorry.

488
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:38,220
The sodium turns on.

489
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,830
What happens?

490
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:40,760
It doesn't do this.

491
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,040
It doesn't turn on
and stay on, right?

492
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,110
The potassium, when
you depolarize,

493
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,840
turns on and stays on,
just like that model.

494
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,580
But the sodium does
something else.

495
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,596
What does it do?

496
00:25:50,596 --> 00:25:51,490
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

497
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:51,970
MICHALE FEE: What's that?

498
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:53,262
AUDIENCE: It's a voltage clamp.

499
00:25:53,262 --> 00:25:55,210
MICHALE FEE: This
is voltage clamp,

500
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:59,680
so it's we're
controlling the voltage.

501
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:03,630
m is already a maximum here,
so it can't shoot up anymore,

502
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:05,670
right?

503
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:09,276
Anybody remember what sodium
does that's really weird?

504
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,270
AUDIENCE: Deactivation.

505
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,000
MICHALE FEE: It inactivates.

506
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,500
So the current turns on,
a conductance turns on,

507
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,530
but it doesn't stay on.

508
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:22,830
It turns off, and that's what
we're going to talk about next.

509
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:27,960
And once we have that, we've got
the whole Hodgkin-Huxley model.

510
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,190
And that'll set us up for
this really interesting sodium

511
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:35,360
channel defect that we're
going to talk about.

512
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:40,900
So that process
there of shutting off

513
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,370
is called inactivation.

514
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:50,320
This process of n turning
on is called activation.

515
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,960
n turning off is
called deactivation.

516
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,600
m turning on is
called activation.

517
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,990
m turning off is
called deactivation.

518
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:03,840
But this other thing
has a different name.

519
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,280
It's called inactivation.

520
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:11,630
It's kind of a little
tricky terminology.

521
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:19,880
So the potassium-- the
probability of the sodium

522
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,650
current being--

523
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:25,290
the sodium channel
being open actually

524
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:30,500
goes like m cubed times some
other gating variable that

525
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,430
describes how this turns off.

526
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:37,040
And so there's another
gating variable, called h.

527
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:42,070
It's called the inactivation
gating variable for sodium.

528
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:46,240
And so now we're going to
figure out how to think about h

529
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,190
and how to describe
it mathematically.

530
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,940
You probably wouldn't
be surprised to hear

531
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,220
that it's just another first
order linear differential

532
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,136
equation--

533
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:02,260
activation gating variable, m,
inactivation gating variable,

534
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,550
h.

535
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,470
So how do we think
about inactivation?

536
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:12,590
Inactivation is literally just
a little loop of goo or snot

537
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:16,670
on the inside of the sodium
channel, and it's charged.

538
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:18,440
And when the sodium
channel opens,

539
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:22,280
it just falls in and
plugs up that the pore.

540
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,610
That's it.

541
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:28,532
So when the membrane
potential is very negative,

542
00:28:28,532 --> 00:28:29,990
the inside of the
cell is negative,

543
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:32,590
there's an electric
field pointing this way,

544
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:36,290
and the inactivation particle
is slightly positively charged.

545
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:40,090
And that pushes it,
keeps it out of the way.

546
00:28:47,006 --> 00:28:49,360
It turns out that
that's a real thing.

547
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,690
It turns out it's just a loop
of amino acids on the inside

548
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:53,752
of the ion channel.

549
00:28:53,752 --> 00:28:55,210
Hodgkin and Huxley,
of course, they

550
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:58,750
didn't have the structure
of the sodium channel,

551
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:02,463
but they actually predicted
the existence of this thing

552
00:29:02,463 --> 00:29:04,255
that they called the
inactivation particle.

553
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:12,660
When you depolarize
the cell, when

554
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:16,500
the membrane potential inside
the cell goes more positive,

555
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,780
that positive
charge is no longer

556
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,330
actively kept out of the pore.

557
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:25,240
And so it falls in
and blocks the pore.

558
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,080
And that prevents
ions from flowing

559
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,080
through the ion channel.

560
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,230
So how would you model this?

561
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:39,640
There's an open state
and a closed state

562
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,380
with energy levels.

563
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,075
How would you want to do that?

564
00:29:44,075 --> 00:29:45,290
AUDIENCE: Use the
Boltzmann distribution.

565
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:47,748
MICHALE FEE: Yeah, you could
use the Boltzmann distribution

566
00:29:47,748 --> 00:29:49,520
to compute the
voltage dependence.

567
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,060
I haven't done that, but I'm
sure it would work pretty well.

568
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,263
How would you model
the time dependence?

569
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,840
So let me ask you this.

570
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,090
If there is a gating variable--
let's start with this.

571
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:06,680
If there is a
gating variable, h,

572
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,920
that we're going to use to
describe this thing getting

573
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,910
open and closed, what is
the voltage dependence

574
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:17,020
of h infinity
going to look like?

575
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:21,090
When the voltage is very
negative, what is h doing?

576
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:22,320
You think it's big or small?

577
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,950
Here's the equation-- m cubed h.

578
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:34,610
So when the-- yeah, right. h has
to start out high and go small

579
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:39,080
in order to explain
this thing turning off.

580
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,930
Does that make sense?

581
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:43,110
So what we're going to do
is we're going to have--

582
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:45,900
we're going to model this again
with two states, an open state

583
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,060
and a closed state.
h is the probability

584
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:53,072
that this inactivation
particle is in the open state.

585
00:30:53,072 --> 00:30:56,690
It turns out that there's
only one of these particles,

586
00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:00,160
and so that explains
why it's just times h,

587
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,840
not times h to some power.

588
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,290
And we have a
differential equation

589
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:10,500
that describes how h changes
as a function of time

590
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,630
in a way that depends
on h infinity.

591
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:17,010
And Aditu, why don't you draw
what h infinity probably looks

592
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:19,200
like as a function of voltage.

593
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,100
AUDIENCE: High.

594
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:20,850
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

595
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:24,240
It just starts
high and goes down.

596
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,890
How do we actually measure that?

597
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:28,480
Let me show you an experiment
how you'd measure that.

598
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,600
So first, let me
just show you this.

599
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:34,860
So when you depolarize the
cell, h starts out high,

600
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,590
because h infinity is high.

601
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:42,540
And then when you depolarize
the cell, h infinity gets small,

602
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:47,010
and h just relaxes exponentially
toward the new smaller h

603
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:47,790
infinity.

604
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:52,860
And what's really cool is that
the tail, this inactivation,

605
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,170
the way that conductance
or the current turns off,

606
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:57,255
is just a single exponential.

607
00:31:57,255 --> 00:32:00,495
It just falls like E to the
minus some time constant.

608
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:07,880
It's just given by this first
order linear differential

609
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,380
equation.

610
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,890
Good.

611
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:17,480
This h getting smaller
is called inactivation.

612
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:21,425
Anybody want to take a guess
at what this is called?

613
00:32:21,425 --> 00:32:22,700
AUDIENCE: Deinactivation.

614
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,640
MICHALE FEE:
Deinactivation, good.

615
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:29,030
So there's activation
and deactivation.

616
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:32,150
There's inactivation
and deinactivation.

617
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:35,360
Those are different things.

618
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,390
Just remember activation,
which is easy, right?

619
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,600
It's just things turning on.

620
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,180
And then there's
the same process

621
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,440
that undoes the turning on.

622
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,530
That's deactivation.

623
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:48,770
And there's inactivation,
which is a separate particle.

624
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:56,390
And it has a process of
blocking and unblocking.

625
00:32:56,390 --> 00:33:00,658
So it's inactivation,
deinactivation.

626
00:33:00,658 --> 00:33:01,700
Any questions about that?

627
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,280
Yes?

628
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,990
AUDIENCE: If there
is any activation,

629
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:06,160
does that mean it's
already charged up?

630
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,130
So what does deactivation mean?

631
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:09,880
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

632
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,020
So when-- here.

633
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:14,140
Let's just go back
to this picture here.

634
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:17,830
When the cell is
hyperpolarized, the thing

635
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:21,850
is hanging out outside
not getting in the way.

636
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:24,940
When you depolarize the
cell, that electric field

637
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:27,970
is not pushing it out
anymore, and it falls in.

638
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:30,790
But when you hyperpolarize
the cell again,

639
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:34,000
that electric field
turns back on.

640
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,190
And what is it going to do?

641
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:41,720
It pushes the particle back
out to the other state,

642
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,710
to the open state.

643
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,838
Any other questions?

644
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:53,330
Pretty simple, right?

645
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:55,520
Kind of very machine-like.

646
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,850
And then what we're
going to talk about soon

647
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:09,070
is how this thing sometimes
doesn't work, this thing.

648
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:15,460
There are genetic
mutations that turn out

649
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:20,260
to be fairly common actually,
where this doesn't reliably

650
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,190
block the pore.

651
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:28,230
And we're going to
see what happens.

652
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,750
First order linear
differential equation.

653
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:35,250
Exponential relaxation
toward new h infinity.

654
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:37,770
We can actually
measure this h infinity

655
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:41,429
as a function of voltage by
doing the following experiment.

656
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:44,909
What we do is we hold
the cell hyperpolarize.

657
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:49,260
We can then step the cell up to
different membrane potentials--

658
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,730
very low or very high.

659
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:54,690
And then what we do is we
jump the membrane potential

660
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:59,790
up to turn on the
activation gating variable.

661
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:01,430
And now we can see--

662
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:03,410
what you see is, that
depending on where

663
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:06,960
you held the voltage before
you did this big voltage step,

664
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,440
you get sodium currents
of different size.

665
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,470
And you can guess that if you
hold the voltage very negative

666
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:14,930
and then turn it on,
that activation gating

667
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:17,930
variable for all those ion
channels is [AUDIO OUT]..

668
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:19,790
And when you turn
on the sodium--

669
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:21,350
turn on the gating
variable, you're

670
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:24,470
going to get a big
current, right?

671
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:29,000
If you hold the cell for a
while here at a higher voltage,

672
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,520
most of those
sodium channels are

673
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,150
going to have that inactivation
gate already closed.

674
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:39,830
And so now when you step
the voltage up, turn on m,

675
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:44,360
you're going to get a
much smaller current.

676
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,330
And so if you just
plot the current size

677
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:49,420
as a function of this
holding potential,

678
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:53,320
you can see that h is
big for low voltages

679
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,720
and goes to 0 for
higher voltages.

680
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:00,420
And what this means is
that when a cell spikes,

681
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:06,360
that voltage goes up, and h
starts falling, and the sodium

682
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,105
channels--

683
00:36:07,105 --> 00:36:08,730
many of the sodium
channels in the cell

684
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:11,040
becomes inactivated--
become inactivated.

685
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:11,720
Yes?

686
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,440
AUDIENCE: The membrane
potential on the x-axis,

687
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,105
is that the difference in the--
is that [AUDIO OUT] or is that

688
00:36:18,105 --> 00:36:18,990
the [INAUDIBLE]?

689
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:23,690
MICHALE FEE: That's the absolute
voltage during this holding.

690
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:24,560
That's right.

691
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:28,580
You can actually see at
rest most cells actually

692
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:31,250
have a substantial fraction
of the sodium channels

693
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:32,947
already inactivated.

694
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,930
So here's the plan.

695
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:50,250
We now have a full
description of the potassium

696
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:56,340
and the sodium conductances as
a function of voltage and time.

697
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:59,310
So we're to put it
all together and make

698
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:04,460
a full quantitative description
of the Hodgkin-Huxley model.

699
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:08,690
Our probability of the sodium
current, sodium channel,

700
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:11,210
being open is m cubed h.

701
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:14,630
I just want to mention
that this m cubed

702
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:17,510
h assumes one thing
about the gating variable

703
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:20,350
and the inactivation variable.

704
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:25,700
The mechanism for activation and
the mechanism for inactivation

705
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,010
assumes what about them?

706
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:28,260
AUDIENCE: They're independent.

707
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,635
MICHALE FEE:
They're independent.

708
00:37:29,635 --> 00:37:32,540
And it turns out that
that's not quite true.

709
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:36,020
It's one of the very few
things that Hodgkin and Huxley

710
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,540
didn't get spot-on.

711
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:43,597
So it's not exactly independent,
but it's really not bad either.

712
00:37:43,597 --> 00:37:45,680
So it's a pretty-- it's
still a pretty good model.

713
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,960
We can write down the
sodium conductance

714
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,240
as just the conductance
of the sodium channel

715
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,910
when it's all the way
open times m cubed h.

716
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:56,780
Yes?

717
00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:00,320
AUDIENCE: So do we know what
the inactivation particle is?

718
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,070
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

719
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,362
We're going to see in a second.

720
00:38:02,362 --> 00:38:04,520
I'll show you exactly
what it looks like

721
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:08,660
and where these
mutations are that have

722
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:11,700
this effect on inactivation.

723
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:18,080
So we can write down
the conductance,

724
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,497
and we can write
down the current.

725
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:22,600
The current is just
the open conductance

726
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:28,010
times m cubed h times
the driving potential.

727
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:30,700
And that's our sodium current.

728
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,114
Yes?

729
00:38:32,114 --> 00:38:34,350
AUDIENCE: For the
[INAUDIBLE],, I'm

730
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:40,438
not showing there is
[INAUDIBLE] like a number,

731
00:38:40,438 --> 00:38:43,048
like sodium channel
or something.

732
00:38:43,048 --> 00:38:43,977
It doesn't have it.

733
00:38:43,977 --> 00:38:45,310
MICHALE FEE: Yeah, that's right.

734
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:52,960
It's one, one single protein,
but it has these transmembrane

735
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,210
alpha-helices that act--

736
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:59,680
are multiple voltage sensors.

737
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,580
And they act somewhat
independently, but still

738
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,200
a little bit
cooperatively, and that's

739
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,990
where this m cubed comes from.

740
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:08,710
But you're right.

741
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:12,460
The potassium channel actually
has four separate subunits

742
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,890
that form a tetramer.

743
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:19,608
The sodium channel [AUDIO OUT]
that it's all one big protein.

744
00:39:19,608 --> 00:39:20,150
That's right.

745
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,810
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

746
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:23,560
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

747
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,510
You should really
think of this--

748
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:27,970
I mean the n and
the m were both--

749
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:30,610
it was empirically
discovered that one

750
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:34,180
goes as n to the fourth, and
the other one goes as m cubed.

751
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,680
And it turns out
for potassium it

752
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,550
has a really beautiful
relation to the structure.

753
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:40,150
For sodium, it's a
little bit messier.

754
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:43,510
And I'm sure there are people
who actually understand more

755
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:47,170
about why it's exactly
m cubed, but I'm not

756
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:48,036
one of those people.

757
00:39:48,036 --> 00:39:53,560
So I'm going to refer
you to the literature.

758
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,280
And I'm happy-- maybe I can
find a good reference for that.

759
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:03,230
So now that we have the sodium
conductance and the sodium

760
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:05,160
current, let's put
this all together.

761
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,370
So here's how we're
going to now--

762
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:09,800
here's the algorithm for
generating an action potential.

763
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,750
And we introduced
this last time,

764
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:14,810
but let's just flesh it
out for the full story.

765
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:20,105
So given an initial voltage,
compute n infinity, tau n,

766
00:40:20,105 --> 00:40:24,350
m infinity, tau m, and
h infinity and tau h,

767
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:25,820
as a function of that voltage.

768
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:28,880
Those are just those
algebraic expressions

769
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,950
that give you the
alpha n and beta

770
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:35,090
n for each of those
things-- one for potassium,

771
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:39,400
one for sodium, the m, and
one for the h for sodium.

772
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,600
So we're going to
calculate all of those.

773
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,510
Steady state gating variables
as a function of voltage,

774
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:47,800
we're going to start from our
initial condition of n, m,

775
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,840
and h, and integrate that
differential equation one time

776
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,860
step using--

777
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,560
it's going to
relax exponentially

778
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:01,110
toward n infinity.

779
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:04,590
We're going to plug that n,
m, and h into our equations

780
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,900
for the potassium
current, sodium

781
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:10,300
current, and leak, which doesn't
have those gating variables.

782
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:13,620
So the potassium current is
Gn to the 4 times the driving

783
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,430
potential.

784
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:19,253
Sodium current is Gm cubed h
[AUDIO OUT] driving potential.

785
00:41:19,253 --> 00:41:20,920
We're going to add
all of those currents

786
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,830
together to give the
total membrane current.

787
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:26,990
That membrane current
is going to give us

788
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:31,820
a V infinity for our cell.

789
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:35,780
Remember, the V infinity
is just the current times

790
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:37,130
the effective resistance.

791
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:39,110
So we can use that
to also calculate

792
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:43,440
the membrane time constant.

793
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,890
And then we integrate the
voltage one time step.

794
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:55,480
Go back and recompute those
n, m, and h infinities.

795
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,500
And then we just keep
cycling through this.

796
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:01,310
When you do that, and
you plot the voltage,

797
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,840
you get an action potential.

798
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,690
Now, you can do
that in a hundredth

799
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,155
of a second in MATLAB.

800
00:42:07,155 --> 00:42:09,530
Hodgkin and Huxley we're doing
this on their slide rules,

801
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:12,265
and they got 2/3 of the way
through an action potential

802
00:42:12,265 --> 00:42:14,270
and said, let's just publish.

803
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:16,394
[LAUGHTER]

804
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:24,220
So here's what that looks like.

805
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:29,110
Here's V as a function
of time for when you

806
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:32,020
implement that loop in MATLAB.

807
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,400
So you can see what you did.

808
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,650
So this is the injected
current through the electrode,

809
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:37,830
and can see it
starts to depolarize

810
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:40,240
the cell a little bit.

811
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,410
And at some point,
what happens is--

812
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:46,960
this is just a copy over here
so you can line things up--

813
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,380
when you inject current, the
cell starts to depolarize.

814
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:53,150
And you can see that
m starts to grow.

815
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:56,270
The sodium current is
starting to turn on.

816
00:42:56,270 --> 00:43:00,680
And at some point,
m gets big enough

817
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:04,520
that it's turning on a
substantial amount of sodium

818
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,963
current into the cell.

819
00:43:06,963 --> 00:43:07,880
And what does that do?

820
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:11,690
It depolarizes to cell more,
which causes m to grow faster,

821
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:15,350
which causes more current, which
depolarizes the cell faster.

822
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:18,050
And it just runs away-- bam--

823
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:21,080
until you reach
essentially the equilibrium

824
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:24,272
potential of sodium.

825
00:43:24,272 --> 00:43:25,980
And then what does
the sodium current do?

826
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:31,160
The sodium current
actually stops

827
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,460
even though the channel's open.

828
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:37,390
Then what happens is, during
that whole time, n has,

829
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:40,570
in this hyperpolarized voltage--

830
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:48,010
the potassium channel is
starting to open and grows,

831
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:51,280
potassium current
conductance turns on,

832
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,910
and that starts
hyperpolerizing the cell.

833
00:43:54,910 --> 00:44:01,410
During that whole time,
the inactivation gate--

834
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:05,270
this cell is very
depolarized, very positive.

835
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:12,650
That little bit of
goo falls in, h drops.

836
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:16,880
That shuts off the
sodium conductance.

837
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:22,860
Potassium conductance finishes
bringing the cell back.

838
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:23,850
Beautiful, right?

839
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:31,450
Yes?

840
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:33,840
AUDIENCE: Is h just
the voltage-dependent

841
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,880
or it's also time-dependent?

842
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:41,320
MICHALE FEE: Time-dependent
in exactly the same way

843
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:45,460
that n and m are time-dependent.

844
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:50,560
There is a-- h infinity
changes as a sum--

845
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,120
as a function of voltage.

846
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:57,520
And then h relaxes
exponentially toward h infinity.

847
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:05,920
Any questions about that?

848
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,260
So for the problem set,
you'll have code for this,

849
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:10,960
and you can play around with
this and try different things.

850
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,600
And then there's a
particular problem

851
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,345
that Daniel and I cooked
up for you for this.

852
00:45:16,345 --> 00:45:18,220
I'll basically show you
what that looks like.

853
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:21,610
Here's the crux of it.

854
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:24,340
If you inject a
little bit of current

855
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:26,830
into the Hodgkin-Huxley
neuron, you get a spike.

856
00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:28,880
And then if you wait
a few milliseconds

857
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:33,280
and inject another current
pulse, what happens?

858
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:38,050
You don't get a spike.

859
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:44,645
Can anybody guess why that is?

860
00:45:44,645 --> 00:45:47,120
AUDIENCE: h is
still inactivated.

861
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:47,870
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

862
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:50,780
That thing is still
stuck in there

863
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:55,830
and hasn't had time
to fall out yet.

864
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:59,300
And if you plot h, you can see
that it hasn't recovered back

865
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:02,910
to the state it was
at the beginning.

866
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:06,930
So that's called a
"refractory period."

867
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:12,810
So cells don't like to spike
two times in a row to close.

868
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:13,565
Yes?

869
00:46:13,565 --> 00:46:16,475
AUDIENCE: So what things
like [INAUDIBLE] h at which

870
00:46:16,475 --> 00:46:17,980
it's a spike?

871
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:18,730
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

872
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:22,430
So you want to just like--

873
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:24,080
what would be the
intuitive answer?

874
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:31,670
So there's not a
hard cutoff, right?

875
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:34,390
If h is right here, it
will be much harder.

876
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:37,600
You'd have to inject a lot
more current to make it spike.

877
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,390
If h is recovered
to here, then it

878
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:42,970
would take a little bit less
current to make it spike.

879
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:46,427
So basically, there's
a gradual decrease

880
00:46:46,427 --> 00:46:48,010
in the amount of
current it would take

881
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:51,040
to make the neuron spike again.

882
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,610
So there's no one answer.

883
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:02,400
So let's take a
look at what happens

884
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,980
when sodium channels go bad.

885
00:47:07,606 --> 00:47:08,273

[MUSIC PLAYING]

887
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:12,490
- Most of the animals
on this petting farm,

888
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:18,170
on Maui, Hawaii, are sweet,
but nothing too unusual.

889
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:22,370
And then there are the goats--

890
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:25,280
Myotonic goats, to be specific--

891
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,450
more commonly known
as stiff-legged goats,

892
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:34,700
wooden-leg goats, nervous
goats, fainting goats.

893
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:38,340
Fainting goats are
indigenous to North America.

894
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:40,500
But that name is a
bit of a misnomer,

895
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,360
because they never
lose consciousness

896
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,500
when they keel over.

897
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:47,970
If they're startled, a genetic
condition causes their muscles

898
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:49,290
to lock up.

899
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:52,020
But it only lasts a few
moments, and then they're

900
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:53,350
back on their feet.

901
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:57,060
Now, until the next
time they're spooked.

902
00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:00,170
[END PLAYBACK]

903
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:03,160
MICHALE FEE: So
these fainting goats

904
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:09,640
have a particular mutation
in their sodium channel.

905
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:12,400
Now, it turns out that
the sodium channels that

906
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,860
are in your brain that
control action potentials

907
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:18,460
are a different gene
than the sodium channels

908
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:21,630
that are in your muscles that
produce muscle contractions.

909
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:27,040
So you can have a mutation
in the skeletal isoform

910
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:32,110
of the sodium channel that
produces these muscular effects

911
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:35,530
without having any
effect on brain function.

912
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:38,430
But that same
mutation in the brain,

913
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:43,450
isoform of the sodium
channel, is lethal.

914
00:48:43,450 --> 00:48:47,110
So this is actually a condition
that exists in humans.

915
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:50,260
It's called-- there are
actually a whole set of these,

916
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:53,830
what are called "sodium
channel myotonias."

917
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:58,420
One of them is called
hyperkalemic periodic

918
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:00,410
paralysis.

919
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:03,900
And this just
shows a different--

920
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:07,890
this is a different phenotype
of one of these sodium channel

921
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:09,100
defects.

922
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:14,020
So the goats became very
stiff and fell over.

923
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:17,076
It turns out there's a different
phenotype that looks like this.

924
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:26,950
So basically, it causes
extreme weakness.

925
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:29,860
The muscles are
completely paralyzed.

926
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:33,370
They can't contract
anymore, and it

927
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:38,020
seems like that would be a
completely different effect--

928
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:40,540
what would cause
muscles to just go

929
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:45,505
rigid and a very similar
thing would cause paralysis--

930
00:49:45,505 --> 00:49:48,080
and it turns out that
actually those two things

931
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,790
have very similar cause.

932
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:54,770
That hyperkalemic-- kalemic
refers to potassium.

933
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:58,460
And so this condition is very
sensitive to potassium levels.

934
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:00,950
At high potassium
levels, it's much worse

935
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:04,040
than at low potassium levels.

936
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:07,840
So there can be an attack
of weakness or paralysis,

937
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:11,740
and then just a few minutes
later somebody's all better,

938
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:15,880
and that paralysis goes away.

939
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:20,010
So to understand what's
going on in this condition,

940
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:24,710
we need to take a look at how
muscle fibers actually work.

941
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:28,340
So let's take a
little detour in that.

942
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:32,060
So basically, let's start
here with the action potential

943
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:34,370
that drives muscle twitches.

944
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:37,310
So the way this works is
that it an action potential

945
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:40,640
will propagate down an axon
toward the neuromuscular

946
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:41,840
junction.

947
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:46,640
That action potential will cause
the release of neurotransmitter

948
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:52,570
that then causes current to
flow into the muscle fiber.

949
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:55,030
That current flowing
into the muscle fiber

950
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:58,690
depolarizes it, turns
on sodium channels,

951
00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:01,750
and that causes an action
potential in the muscle fiber

952
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:04,360
that looks very much
like the action potential

953
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:09,740
that we just saw for a neuron
for the squid giant axon.

954
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:12,160
Now, there is this
famous problem,

955
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:15,230
called the "excitation
contraction coupling problem,"

956
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:18,040
which is, how does an
action potential here

957
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:23,115
on the surface of a muscle fiber
get down into the myofibril

958
00:51:23,115 --> 00:51:25,390
and cause a contraction
of the muscle?

959
00:51:29,363 --> 00:51:31,280
So we'll get to that
question, but let me just

960
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,610
describe what these things are.

961
00:51:32,610 --> 00:51:37,610
So the myofibrils--
the myofibril

962
00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:43,230
is this little element inside
of the muscle fiber itself.

963
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:52,130
And these are bundles of thick
fibers and thin fibers that

964
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:53,910
essentially--

965
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:55,460
here, I think it's
on the next slide.

966
00:51:59,010 --> 00:52:02,280
So let me just finish the
story about how the action

967
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:03,870
potential gets inside.

968
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:06,960
So the action
potential propagates

969
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,260
through these little structures
called transverse tubules.

970
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:13,830
These are little tubes that go
from the surface of the muscle

971
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:18,150
fiber down into the muscle cell.

972
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:19,720
They're like axons.

973
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,120
But instead of going
out from the cell body,

974
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,840
they go into the cell body.

975
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:25,860
That's pretty cool.

976
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:26,980
This thing is huge.

977
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:32,650
This muscle fiber is
about 100 microns across.

978
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:36,900
So in order for that signal
to get into the myofibril

979
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:38,430
to cause contraction,
it actually

980
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:40,410
has to propagate
down an axon that

981
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:42,540
goes into the muscle fiber.

982
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:47,700
So that action potential
propagates down

983
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:53,600
into the t-tubules that's a
voltage pulse that opens up

984
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:58,760
voltage-dependent calcium
channels that activate

985
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,980
calcium release in
something called

986
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:02,510
the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

987
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:04,760
So you may remember
that in neurons

988
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:08,840
the endoplasmic reticulum
sequesters calcium.

989
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,270
In a muscle fiber, the
sarcoplasmic reticulum

990
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:12,120
does the same thing.

991
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,490
It's sequesters calcium.

992
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:15,200
But when this voltage
pulse comes down

993
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,690
the t-tubule, its
voltage-dependent calcium

994
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:20,220
channels, which cause
the release of calcium,

995
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:23,480
which then activates
calcium-dependent calcium

996
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,610
release through another
set of channels,

997
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:31,380
and it basically floods the
myofibrils with calcium.

998
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:33,720
And that triggers
the contraction.

999
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,580
And here's how that works.

1000
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:40,210
Within these myofibrils are
bundles of thick filaments,

1001
00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:45,060
which are myosin and thin
filaments, which are actin.

1002
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:52,080
The thick filaments are
these structures right here.

1003
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,990
The actin are filaments,
thin filaments,

1004
00:53:54,990 --> 00:54:02,010
that intercalate between
the myosin thick filaments.

1005
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:07,410
The myosin thick filaments
are covered with these myosin

1006
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:08,760
molecules that stick out.

1007
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:13,650
The myosin heads that are
like little feet reach out.

1008
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:17,040
And if they bind
to the actin, then

1009
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:21,120
these things basically grab the
actin and start walking along.

1010
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,830
And they pull the actin.

1011
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:26,220
They pull this actin
filament this way.

1012
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:29,100
The ones over here
walk this direction

1013
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,440
and pull this actin
filament that way,

1014
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:36,615
and that causes these
two end plates to pull,

1015
00:54:36,615 --> 00:54:39,660
sorry, these two, what
are called "z disks,"

1016
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:41,670
to pull together.

1017
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:42,985
And the thing shortens.

1018
00:54:42,985 --> 00:54:43,860
Does that make sense?

1019
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:48,780
And then when the
contraction stops,

1020
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:51,870
these little feet stop walking.

1021
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:55,470
They relax, and those
actin filaments now

1022
00:54:55,470 --> 00:54:58,110
can relax and retract.

1023
00:54:58,110 --> 00:54:59,670
Pretty cool, right?

1024
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:02,090
So how does the calcium
connect to that?

1025
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:05,475
So the calcium goes in,
floods this myofibril.

1026
00:55:05,475 --> 00:55:09,240
The calcium goes in and binds
to these little molecules,

1027
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:14,380
called troponin, that are
sitting in grooves of the actin

1028
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:15,340
filaments.

1029
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:17,710
And when the calcium
binds to troponin,

1030
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:19,930
it moves out of the
way and opens up

1031
00:55:19,930 --> 00:55:23,860
the binding site for
these myosin heads to grab

1032
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:25,180
onto the actin filament.

1033
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:29,050
They grab on and they pull.

1034
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:32,980
And as soon as they
pull, an ATP comes off.

1035
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:36,160
These things open
up, ATP binds, boom.

1036
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,630
They pull again.

1037
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:42,580
So they just walk along
with one ATP per cycle.

1038
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:43,780
Then when the calcium--

1039
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:47,050
what happens is that the calcium
starts being sequestered back

1040
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:51,040
into the sarcoplasmic reticulum
that unbinds from the troponin.

1041
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:53,320
The troponin falls
back into the groove,

1042
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:57,790
and the myosin heads can no
longer connect to the actin.

1043
00:55:57,790 --> 00:56:01,330
And that's the end
of the muscle twitch.

1044
00:56:01,330 --> 00:56:02,320
Pretty amazing, right?

1045
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:13,770
So what goes wrong when sodium
channels are inactivated?

1046
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:16,270
And that's what we're going to
talk about next-- when sodium

1047
00:56:16,270 --> 00:56:18,610
channels fail to inactivate.

1048
00:56:18,610 --> 00:56:22,490
So here's what the sodium
channel looks like.

1049
00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:30,020
There are these clusters of
transmembrane alpha-helices.

1050
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:32,270
These things together,
these four things together,

1051
00:56:32,270 --> 00:56:34,680
form the pore.

1052
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:38,240
And there's a loop
between them here

1053
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:41,810
that produces the inactivation.

1054
00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:44,840
And you can see, if
you look at the sights

1055
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:47,900
of different mutations
of the sodium channel

1056
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:50,750
that produce defective
inactivation,

1057
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:54,590
they tend to be clustered
in these cytoplasmic loops

1058
00:56:54,590 --> 00:56:55,640
of the sodium channel.

1059
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:04,200
So myotonia and the
periodic paralysis

1060
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,090
that we just saw
in those movies are

1061
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:12,390
caused by these different sets
of mutations on those loops.

1062
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:17,340
And again, for these
myotonias, these mutations

1063
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:21,680
are in the skeletal isoform
of the sodium channel.

1064
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:26,590
So now, what do those
mutations actually do to this?

1065
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:28,230
So now, let's take
a look at-- let's do

1066
00:57:28,230 --> 00:57:30,870
a patch clamp
experiment, where we take

1067
00:57:30,870 --> 00:57:35,260
muscle fiber from a wild-type.

1068
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:37,830
So you can just take
a muscle biopsy--

1069
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:40,080
extract a little
pinch of muscle.

1070
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:43,050
You can culture it in a dish.

1071
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:45,970
And you can do that for
wild-type, normal human muscle

1072
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:46,470
fibers.

1073
00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:49,650
And you can do it
for muscle fibers

1074
00:57:49,650 --> 00:57:55,860
from a person with this
particular mutation

1075
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:57,210
of this sodium channel.

1076
00:57:57,210 --> 00:57:59,940
And you can see that just
like for the neurons,

1077
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:02,650
just like for the sodium
channels in neurons,

1078
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:08,220
you can see that
depolarizing this ion channel

1079
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:13,240
produces brief openings that
are aligned at the time when

1080
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:16,030
you do the depolarization step.

1081
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:18,520
And then there are
no more openings.

1082
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:21,280
The sodium channels
turn on, and then

1083
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:26,510
that gating variable,
that inactivation gate,

1084
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:30,650
shuts off the pores, and
there are no more openings.

1085
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:36,750
But in the muscle fiber
that has this mutation,

1086
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:40,820
you can see that you get
this burst of openings right

1087
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:45,480
at the time of depolarization,
but you keep getting openings

1088
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,305
at later times.

1089
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:55,230
And if you plot the average
current over many trials,

1090
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:57,170
you can see in
normal fibers there's

1091
00:58:57,170 --> 00:58:59,630
this very brief
pulse of opening,

1092
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:03,520
and in these fibers, muscle
fibers, with a mutation,

1093
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:10,270
there is a constant extended
high probability of that sodium

1094
00:59:10,270 --> 00:59:12,930
channel turning on, opening up.

1095
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:17,450
And that's what causes all
the problems right there.

1096
00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:21,400
In these conditions, that
only represents about a 2%,

1097
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:26,520
a 0.02 probability,
of turning on

1098
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:29,761
at a time when a normal muscle
fiber would be inactivated.

1099
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:38,360
So you can actually study
these things in more detail.

1100
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:40,210
So this shows a set of
experiments that were

1101
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:45,490
done in rat fast twitch muscle.

1102
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:48,790
This shows a control, and
this shows a muscle fiber

1103
00:59:48,790 --> 00:59:54,220
that's been treated with a
toxin that comes from the sea

1104
00:59:54,220 --> 01:00:00,610
anemone that produces a
toxin that uses this toxin

1105
01:00:00,610 --> 01:00:03,315
to actually help catch prey.

1106
01:00:03,315 --> 01:00:04,690
And it turns out,
what that toxin

1107
01:00:04,690 --> 01:00:10,420
does is it mimics the
effect of this blockage

1108
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:13,780
of the inactivation
of the sodium channel.

1109
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:16,720
So you can see that
applying this toxin

1110
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:20,770
also produces these
extended openings

1111
01:00:20,770 --> 01:00:24,480
or failures to inactivate.

1112
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:27,490
If you take that toxin and you
[AUDIO OUT] to a muscle fiber,

1113
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:29,520
you see something
really interesting.

1114
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:30,760
You take a muscle fiber.

1115
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:34,710
You can hook it up to--

1116
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:37,560
tie a string to one end, and
tie a string to the other end,

1117
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:39,780
and kind pull it
tight a little bit,

1118
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:43,890
and measure the force that
that muscle fiber is exerting.

1119
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:46,840
So you can measure force
as a function of time.

1120
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:48,690
If you stimulate
that muscle fiber

1121
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:50,880
with a little
electrical shock, you

1122
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:54,330
can elicit what's
called a muscle twitch.

1123
01:00:57,020 --> 01:01:00,800
And in the presence
of this ATXII toxin,

1124
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:06,030
you can see that that twitch
is very extended in time.

1125
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:07,260
Is there a question?

1126
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:08,290
Did I see a hand?

1127
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:08,790
No.

1128
01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:12,270
So what's going on?

1129
01:01:12,270 --> 01:01:15,850
So you can now record
from this muscle fiber

1130
01:01:15,850 --> 01:01:20,650
when it's been treated with
this toxin that produces

1131
01:01:20,650 --> 01:01:25,030
what's called a myotonic run.

1132
01:01:25,030 --> 01:01:28,540
And you can see that [AUDIO OUT]
muscle fiber produces

1133
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:34,850
a single or maybe two action
potentials when depolarize it.

1134
01:01:34,850 --> 01:01:38,650
That's what a muscle
fiber normally does.

1135
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:43,450
But when you treat
it with this ATXII,

1136
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:46,522
it generates many
action potentials.

1137
01:01:46,522 --> 01:01:47,940
Now, why would that be?

1138
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:50,910
Does that make sense?

1139
01:01:50,910 --> 01:01:55,640
We're going to
explore why that is.

1140
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:58,340
We're going to look at
a particular model for

1141
01:01:58,340 --> 01:01:59,870
how the sodium--

1142
01:01:59,870 --> 01:02:02,090
the failure to inactivate
of the sodium channel

1143
01:02:02,090 --> 01:02:04,040
produces these myotonic runs.

1144
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:06,500
What's really crazy is
that after you turn off

1145
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:11,950
that current injection that
activates the muscle fiber,

1146
01:02:11,950 --> 01:02:13,320
the neuron keeps spiking.

1147
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:14,745
The muscle fiber keeps spiking.

1148
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:23,280
That continued
spiking corresponds

1149
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:26,590
to continued contraction
of the muscle.

1150
01:02:26,590 --> 01:02:30,240
So you can trigger the muscle
to generate some action

1151
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,860
potentials in a
normal muscle that

1152
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:34,140
produces a very brief twitch.

1153
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:38,220
But in these muscles with
this mutated sodium channel--

1154
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:39,630
in this case it's
with the toxin,

1155
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:43,620
but the same thing happens
in the muscle fibers with

1156
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:45,350
the mutated sodium channel--

1157
01:02:45,350 --> 01:02:48,660
it produces continued
contraction of the muscle.

1158
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:51,760
And that's what was
happening to the goats.

1159
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:54,680
Their muscles contracted,
and then they didn't relax.

1160
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:57,543
And so they were stiff like
this, and then they fall over.

1161
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:06,510
Now, that's called
a myotonic run.

1162
01:03:06,510 --> 01:03:09,300
It's really interesting
and was a big clue

1163
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:15,930
to what the mechanism
is that produces this.

1164
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:18,810
If you take these muscle
fibers and you put them

1165
01:03:18,810 --> 01:03:25,890
into a solution that doesn't
have the right osmolarity--

1166
01:03:25,890 --> 01:03:34,130
so too much, two too many
ions, too high an osmolarity,

1167
01:03:34,130 --> 01:03:37,970
or too low an osmolarity, just
like pure water, for example--

1168
01:03:37,970 --> 01:03:40,970
produces what's called
an osmotic shock.

1169
01:03:40,970 --> 01:03:45,130
And what it does is it
breaks all the t-tubules

1170
01:03:45,130 --> 01:03:47,380
from the membrane.

1171
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:49,720
So it doesn't
break the membrane,

1172
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:54,780
but it disconnects all the
t-tubules from the membrane.

1173
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:58,930
Now, what happens is you see
the myotonic run goes away.

1174
01:03:58,930 --> 01:04:03,490
So something about the t-tubules
is causing this myotonic run.

1175
01:04:10,390 --> 01:04:23,150
So there's a really beautiful
set of papers from David Corey

1176
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:29,040
and a person named Cannon, who
proposed a hypothesis for why

1177
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:32,550
this actually happens, and I'll
walk you through the hypothesis

1178
01:04:32,550 --> 01:04:34,140
right now.

1179
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:35,860
So here's the idea.

1180
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:40,870
So when you have an
input from a motor neuron

1181
01:04:40,870 --> 01:04:46,740
onto the muscle fiber you get
synaptic input, [AUDIO OUT]

1182
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:47,520
muscle fibers.

1183
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,140
So this is the motor
neuron synapse.

1184
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:51,090
That's the muscle fiber.

1185
01:04:51,090 --> 01:04:55,200
So you should think about this
as being a very long cell here,

1186
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:59,730
and here's a t-tubule that's
represented by a channel coming

1187
01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:00,690
in from the surface.

1188
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:06,160
So this is a cross-section
of the muscle fiber.

1189
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:08,300
So the idea is that
that current injection

1190
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:11,840
causes an action potential,
which causes sodium

1191
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:13,580
to flow into the cell.

1192
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:18,270
And on the hyperpolarize
phase of the action potential,

1193
01:05:18,270 --> 01:05:21,860
potassium goes out of the
cell to bring the cell back

1194
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:25,170
down to a negative voltage.

1195
01:05:25,170 --> 01:05:28,575
Now, that actual potential
propagates into the t-tubule,

1196
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:30,200
which means you're
going to have sodium

1197
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:32,480
flowing into the cell
and potassium flowing out

1198
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:33,380
of the cell.

1199
01:05:33,380 --> 01:05:38,040
But out of the cell means
into the t-tubule, right?

1200
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:40,650
So what normally happens is,
after an action potential,

1201
01:05:40,650 --> 01:05:44,640
you're left with an excess
of potassium in the t-tubule.

1202
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:51,139
So what happens-- think is
going to happen, anybody?

1203
01:05:56,067 --> 01:05:57,400
Think back to the first lecture.

1204
01:06:01,638 --> 01:06:02,630
Yeah?

1205
01:06:02,630 --> 01:06:04,130
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1206
01:06:04,130 --> 01:06:05,713
MICHALE FEE: Yeah,
there's going to be

1207
01:06:05,713 --> 01:06:07,550
some pumping going on here.

1208
01:06:07,550 --> 01:06:09,350
But actually, most
of the potassium

1209
01:06:09,350 --> 01:06:13,460
gets out of the t-tubule
by a different mechanism.

1210
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:15,390
It gets out by diffusion.

1211
01:06:15,390 --> 01:06:18,860
So these extra potassium
ions diffuse out

1212
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:24,700
through that t-tubule back
into the extracellular space.

1213
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:27,840
Now, can we estimate how
long it takes that to happen?

1214
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:32,810
Any idea how we would do that?

1215
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:39,190
Anybody want to take a guess?

1216
01:06:39,190 --> 01:06:41,570
Does anyone remember
how long it takes an ion

1217
01:06:41,570 --> 01:06:44,640
to diffuse across, let's
say, a cell body, 10 microns?

1218
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:51,930
Kind of a few tens
of milliseconds,

1219
01:06:51,930 --> 01:06:53,560
right, 50 milliseconds?

1220
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:55,970
This thing is about
25 microns long.

1221
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:59,140
And so it will be
maybe four times that.

1222
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:01,350
So that timescale
we can calculate

1223
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:06,180
by just using our equation
for the relation between time

1224
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:08,190
and distance for a
diffusion, and you

1225
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:12,540
find that that's about
300 to 400 milliseconds.

1226
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:15,950
So that's how long it
takes those potassium ions

1227
01:07:15,950 --> 01:07:19,340
to diffuse out of the t-tubule.

1228
01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:28,290
Now, what happens
when we have a sodium

1229
01:07:28,290 --> 01:07:31,440
ion that isn't inactivating?

1230
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:34,750
What happens is you're going
to get a lot more spikes.

1231
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:36,850
You're going to get a lot
more spikes generated,

1232
01:07:36,850 --> 01:07:39,760
because this sodium
current turns on,

1233
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,120
but now it's not
properly inactivating.

1234
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:44,300
And so you're going
to get extra spikes.

1235
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:47,890
And those failure to enact
[AUDIO OUT] extra spikes,

1236
01:07:47,890 --> 01:07:49,550
and extra spikes
means you're going

1237
01:07:49,550 --> 01:07:53,460
to have a lot more potassium
going into the t-tubule.

1238
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:03,710
So what is all that--

1239
01:08:03,710 --> 01:08:07,340
and remember, we now have
300 or 400 milliseconds

1240
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:10,070
before that potassium can
get out of the t-tubule

1241
01:08:10,070 --> 01:08:11,960
by diffusion.

1242
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:13,490
So what's going
to happen when you

1243
01:08:13,490 --> 01:08:19,293
have all that extra
potassium in the t-tubule?

1244
01:08:19,293 --> 01:08:20,210
What's it going to do?

1245
01:08:23,633 --> 01:08:24,611
Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]?

1246
01:08:24,611 --> 01:08:27,060
AUDIENCE: It corrects the
muscle fiber [INAUDIBLE]..

1247
01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:28,210
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

1248
01:08:28,210 --> 01:08:32,840
So remember, the
equilibrium potential,

1249
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:34,930
the negative
equilibrium potential

1250
01:08:34,930 --> 01:08:39,370
of the muscle fiber, which
is normally, like any cell,

1251
01:08:39,370 --> 01:08:45,090
is down around minus 80,
that negative potential

1252
01:08:45,090 --> 01:08:47,100
is caused because
there's so much more

1253
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:50,580
potassium inside the cell
than outside the cell.

1254
01:08:50,580 --> 01:08:52,649
And so the potassium
ions are normally

1255
01:08:52,649 --> 01:08:55,080
kind of leaking out of
a cell, and that keeps

1256
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:56,640
the membrane potential low.

1257
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:57,600
But now, if you--

1258
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:00,020
remember, this is
outside the cell.

1259
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:02,430
So you have now, suddenly,
a very high concentration

1260
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:04,560
of potassium ions
outside the cell.

1261
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:05,670
And what do they do?

1262
01:09:05,670 --> 01:09:08,100
They push their way back in.

1263
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:13,390
They start diffusing back in,
which does what to the cell?

1264
01:09:13,390 --> 01:09:15,689
You now have
potassium ions going

1265
01:09:15,689 --> 01:09:20,430
the wrong way, which does what?

1266
01:09:20,430 --> 01:09:22,487
I think you already
gave the answer.

1267
01:09:22,487 --> 01:09:23,029
Say it again.

1268
01:09:23,029 --> 01:09:23,660
AUDIENCE: Depolarizes it.

1269
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:25,355
MICHALE FEE:
Depolarizes the cell.

1270
01:09:25,355 --> 01:09:30,752
Puts potassium back in, and
it depolarizes the cell.

1271
01:09:30,752 --> 01:09:31,960
And what is that going to do?

1272
01:09:37,684 --> 01:09:39,120
AUDIENCE: Cause more spikes.

1273
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:43,310
MICHALE FEE: Cause more spikes,
which is going to do what?

1274
01:09:43,310 --> 01:09:46,212
Push more potassium
into the t-tubule.

1275
01:09:46,212 --> 01:09:50,740
It's runaway instability.

1276
01:09:50,740 --> 01:09:55,630
So that's kind of a
cool hypothesis, right?

1277
01:09:55,630 --> 01:09:58,030
You could imagine all sorts
of experiments to test this.

1278
01:09:58,030 --> 01:10:00,238
Like you could put a little
thing in there to measure

1279
01:10:00,238 --> 01:10:02,030
potassium concentration
in the t-tubule.

1280
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:05,070
Well, that's only a
few microns across.

1281
01:10:05,070 --> 01:10:07,390
How do you test this hypothesis?

1282
01:10:07,390 --> 01:10:12,770
How would you--
it's a great idea.

1283
01:10:12,770 --> 01:10:15,570
But how do you know if it even
makes any sense when you put it

1284
01:10:15,570 --> 01:10:19,130
all together, any suggestions?

1285
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:23,700
Yeah?

1286
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:28,412
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
the potassium.

1287
01:10:28,412 --> 01:10:29,120
MICHALE FEE: Yep.

1288
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:32,480
So it's already known
that at low potassium

1289
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:34,850
this problem is less severe.

1290
01:10:34,850 --> 01:10:40,610
The disease is even named after
that observation-- hyperkalemic

1291
01:10:40,610 --> 01:10:43,260
periodic paralysis.

1292
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:44,310
Any other suggestions?

1293
01:10:44,310 --> 01:10:45,810
What are we here for?

1294
01:10:45,810 --> 01:10:46,875
What is this class?

1295
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:54,810
Introduction to neural
computation, right?

1296
01:10:54,810 --> 01:10:56,730
So what can we do?

1297
01:10:56,730 --> 01:10:59,390
This is a word model, right?

1298
01:10:59,390 --> 01:11:01,830
When you actually
put it all together,

1299
01:11:01,830 --> 01:11:05,820
you could do all this,
and when you model it,

1300
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:07,515
it makes no sense whatsoever.

1301
01:11:07,515 --> 01:11:09,390
There's something wrong
with this word model.

1302
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:11,955
Neuroscience is
full of word models.

1303
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:20,170
The only way to know if a
word model makes any sense

1304
01:11:20,170 --> 01:11:23,710
is to actually write
down some equations

1305
01:11:23,710 --> 01:11:28,000
and see if it works the way
you think it is going to work.

1306
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:32,070
See if your word model
translates into math.

1307
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:36,360
And so that's what David
Corey and Cannon did.

1308
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:41,440
They took this picture,
and they developed a model

1309
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:42,970
for what that looks like it.

1310
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:46,300
And it started with just
the Hodgkin-Huxley model.

1311
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:47,380
Here's Hodgkin-Huxley.

1312
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:49,420
That's what we've
been using all along.

1313
01:11:49,420 --> 01:11:51,430
They added another
little compartment

1314
01:11:51,430 --> 01:11:55,240
that represents the conductances
and the batteries associated

1315
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:58,460
with the membrane
in the t-tubule.

1316
01:11:58,460 --> 01:12:01,090
And notice, there's a EK here.

1317
01:12:01,090 --> 01:12:02,470
What does EK depend on?

1318
01:12:06,961 --> 01:12:07,960
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1319
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:09,260
MICHALE FEE: Say it again.

1320
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:12,075
EK depends on--

1321
01:12:12,075 --> 01:12:12,950
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1322
01:12:12,950 --> 01:12:13,846
MICHALE FEE: Of--

1323
01:12:13,846 --> 01:12:14,742
AUDIENCE: Potassium.

1324
01:12:14,742 --> 01:12:15,640
AUDIENCE: Potassium.

1325
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:18,450
MICHALE FEE: Of potassium
ions, and potassium

1326
01:12:18,450 --> 01:12:21,150
ions are changing.

1327
01:12:21,150 --> 01:12:25,980
So let's actually-- so
this part you already know.

1328
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:28,595
That's just Hodgkin and Huxley
with a few extra resistors

1329
01:12:28,595 --> 01:12:29,720
attached to the side of it.

1330
01:12:32,510 --> 01:12:33,760
What about the potassium part?

1331
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:36,760
Let's just flesh out that
model a little bit more

1332
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:40,450
to see how spiking activity
would lead to changes

1333
01:12:40,450 --> 01:12:42,340
in potassium, how that
change in potassium

1334
01:12:42,340 --> 01:12:43,930
would change the
battery, and how

1335
01:12:43,930 --> 01:12:47,200
that would feedback and
change the spiking activity.

1336
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:48,800
So let's do that.

1337
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:52,390
So we're going to
imagine that we

1338
01:12:52,390 --> 01:12:55,123
are going to model our
potassium conductance in here.

1339
01:12:55,123 --> 01:12:57,040
So we're going to write
down a variable that's

1340
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:00,130
the potassium concentration
inside the t-tubule.

1341
01:13:03,150 --> 01:13:08,020
And what is going to affect
that potassium concentration?

1342
01:13:08,020 --> 01:13:10,920
What are the sources
of potassium?

1343
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:13,840
What are the sinks of
potassium, anybody?

1344
01:13:19,230 --> 01:13:21,630
Well, one is just diffusion.

1345
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:25,050
So we can model that, and that
looks an awful lot, actually,

1346
01:13:25,050 --> 01:13:27,520
like Fick's first law.

1347
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:29,900
So the change in
potassium concentration

1348
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:32,480
as a function of time
has a contribution

1349
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:36,110
from the difference between
the potassium concentration

1350
01:13:36,110 --> 01:13:37,130
inside and outside.

1351
01:13:40,110 --> 01:13:42,810
That rate of change
through diffusion

1352
01:13:42,810 --> 01:13:45,960
is proportional to the
difference in concentration

1353
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:48,570
inside and outside divided
by that time constant

1354
01:13:48,570 --> 01:13:50,106
that we've just calculated.

1355
01:13:54,210 --> 01:13:57,640
Now, what-- so that's
how potassium leaves.

1356
01:13:57,640 --> 01:14:01,330
That's one way that
potassium leaves.

1357
01:14:01,330 --> 01:14:06,240
So the potassium gets
into the t-tubule

1358
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:08,550
at a rate that's just
proportional to the potassium

1359
01:14:08,550 --> 01:14:09,120
current.

1360
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:12,600
The rate of change of the
potassium concentration

1361
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:16,610
is proportional to
the potassium current.

1362
01:14:16,610 --> 01:14:17,952
And the potassium current--

1363
01:14:17,952 --> 01:14:19,910
so let's just flesh this
out a little bit more.

1364
01:14:19,910 --> 01:14:21,650
This, we already calculated.

1365
01:14:21,650 --> 01:14:23,960
This is the conductance
times the driving potential.

1366
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:27,830
But that current, we have to
do a little bit of changes

1367
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:29,870
of units to get
current into the right

1368
01:14:29,870 --> 01:14:33,050
units for a change in
potassium concentration

1369
01:14:33,050 --> 01:14:34,380
as a function of time.

1370
01:14:34,380 --> 01:14:38,240
So current is
coulombs per second,

1371
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:45,570
and here we have moles
per liter per second.

1372
01:14:45,570 --> 01:14:47,990
So we need to divide
by two things.

1373
01:14:47,990 --> 01:14:51,530
We need the volume
of the t-tubule,

1374
01:14:51,530 --> 01:14:53,450
and we need Faraday's
constant, which

1375
01:14:53,450 --> 01:14:56,360
is just coulombs per mole.

1376
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:59,410
That's a well-known number
that you can just look up.

1377
01:14:59,410 --> 01:15:01,010
Multiply those two
things together,

1378
01:15:01,010 --> 01:15:03,550
you get the contribution
of the potassium current

1379
01:15:03,550 --> 01:15:08,070
to the rate of change of
potassium concentration.

1380
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:10,890
The potassium current is
just conductance times

1381
01:15:10,890 --> 01:15:12,720
driving potential.

1382
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:16,080
Notice the EK is a function
of potassium concentration.

1383
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:18,030
I haven't written it in
here, but that's just

1384
01:15:18,030 --> 01:15:19,837
the Nernst potential.

1385
01:15:19,837 --> 01:15:21,420
And so we have a
differential equation

1386
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:24,750
for the potassium concentration
as a function of time.

1387
01:15:24,750 --> 01:15:29,400
It's a function of the
potassium concentration voltage

1388
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:32,630
and equilibrium potential.

1389
01:15:32,630 --> 01:15:37,620
And now, we just take that
and add it to the code

1390
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:40,155
that we already have
for Hodgkin and Huxley.

1391
01:15:43,070 --> 01:15:45,040
And here's what you get.

1392
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:47,200
So here's a normal muscle fiber.

1393
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:50,690
You get a single
action potential.

1394
01:15:50,690 --> 01:15:52,310
What they did was they modeled--

1395
01:15:52,310 --> 01:15:54,770
they made some fraction
of those ion channels

1396
01:15:54,770 --> 01:15:55,700
fail to inactivate.

1397
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:57,200
And here's what
happens to the model

1398
01:15:57,200 --> 01:16:04,010
when you make 2% sodium
channels fail to inactivate.

1399
01:16:04,010 --> 01:16:08,600
You see that you get this large
number of action potentials,

1400
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:13,080
because the sodium channels
are not inactivating properly.

1401
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:15,800
And when you turn
the current off,

1402
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:18,740
you get this high
potassium concentration

1403
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:23,820
in the t-tubule that's now
causing additional spikes.

1404
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:30,550
That is continued
contraction of the muscle.

1405
01:16:30,550 --> 01:16:34,630
That is this myotonia.

1406
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:37,370
The model is
exhibiting myotonia.

1407
01:16:37,370 --> 01:16:39,280
How do you explain
periodic paralysis?

1408
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:40,840
That's totally different, right?

1409
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:43,408
Now the muscle just
goes completely limp.

1410
01:16:43,408 --> 01:16:44,200
How do you do that?

1411
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:45,970
Any thoughts about this?

1412
01:16:48,970 --> 01:16:50,470
What do you think
would happen if we

1413
01:16:50,470 --> 01:16:54,520
made a slightly larger
fraction of the sodium channels

1414
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:57,604
fail to inactivate?

1415
01:16:57,604 --> 01:17:00,540
Here's what happens.

1416
01:17:00,540 --> 01:17:03,790
You get more and more
action potentials.

1417
01:17:03,790 --> 01:17:10,090
And at some point, what happens
is the voltage just locks up.

1418
01:17:10,090 --> 01:17:12,250
The sodium channels go
into a different state

1419
01:17:12,250 --> 01:17:15,160
where the system is
no longer oscillating.

1420
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:19,030
It's just fixed
at a high voltage.

1421
01:17:19,030 --> 01:17:22,920
It's called
depolarization block,

1422
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:29,830
and it's what happens when
there's no longer enough--

1423
01:17:29,830 --> 01:17:32,770
there aren't enough
sodium channels

1424
01:17:32,770 --> 01:17:36,100
active to give you
spiking, but there

1425
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:40,090
are enough non-inactivated
sodium channels to just hold

1426
01:17:40,090 --> 01:17:41,710
the voltage high.

1427
01:17:41,710 --> 01:17:46,250
And this muscle fiber is
no longer able to contract,

1428
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:48,530
and it's completely flaccid.

1429
01:17:48,530 --> 01:17:50,600
It's completely loose.

1430
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:56,310
And so this is the hyperkalemic
periodic paralysis.

1431
01:17:56,310 --> 01:18:01,280
So you get both of these
really interesting phenotypes

1432
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:05,760
in this disease just depending
on one little parameter, which

1433
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:10,470
is what fraction of
these sodium channels

1434
01:18:10,470 --> 01:18:12,530
are failing to inactivate.

1435
01:18:12,530 --> 01:18:17,790
And so you can see, you get
this very complex phenotype

1436
01:18:17,790 --> 01:18:22,780
from a simple mutation
of an ion channel.

1437
01:18:22,780 --> 01:18:29,100
And in order to understand
really how it's behaving,

1438
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:31,160
you have to do
modeling like this.

1439
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:36,490
It's the way you understand
a system and how it works.

1440
01:18:36,490 --> 01:18:42,100
Until you do this, you
don't really understand it.

1441
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:43,730
So I'll leave it there.

1442
01:18:43,730 --> 01:18:45,420
Thank you.
