00:00:10,898 --> 00:00:13,440
GARY GENSLER: We're going to go
through payment systems, what

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,890
is a payment system, in fact,
some trends around the payment

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,920
system, which is a little
bit of a statistical review,

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,970
and then critically think
about the pain points, a list

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,850
that I've been keeping
as I teach FinTech

9
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,340
and also as I think
about cryptocurrencies

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,910
and how they might insert
themselves in this space.

11
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,910
Some trends around
the globe with nations

12
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,030
trying to move forward with
real-time gross settlement,

13
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,200
the idea that you could
settle payment transactions

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,710
instantaneously, 24 hours
a day, 7 days a week,

15
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,650
which many nations don't do yet.

16
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,280
Some do.

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,910
We'll get into that.

18
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:53,300
And then the landscape itself.

19
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,980
What are the companies
doing and so forth?

20
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,140
Harkening back to
last discussion,

21
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,790
what are we seeing in the crypto
projects and tokenization?

22
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,370
And then close out
on Facebook Libra

23
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:10,510
and China's Digital Currency
Electronic Payment project.

24
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:11,590
So a lot to cover.

25
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:15,820
But please, as I had
said, video's on.

26
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,160
So we can keep this sense
of community and audio off.

27
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,800
But anytime you have a
question, raise the blue hand

28
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,650
in the participant area.

29
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,130
Engage in the chat room
amongst yourselves,

30
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,590
or Romain would be
good enough just

31
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,270
to interrupt me when
he sees something

32
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:33,250
interesting in the chat.

33
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,695
Or for that matter,
even if you're a student

34
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:37,570
and you see something
interesting in the chat

35
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:40,610
that Romain's not raising, you
can raise your hand and say,

36
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,430
I see three things
in the chat room,

37
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:48,290
and I want to capture that
for the class and so forth.

38
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,950
So the readings
today, I thought it

39
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,310
was interesting to take a
speech by Lael Brainard.

40
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:58,210
Lael is on the US
Federal Reserve Board.

41
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:04,620
And as they do in many
commissions and boards

42
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,040
of central banks
around the globe,

43
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,600
they allocate
different projects.

44
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:15,040
Now, Lael is part of the
Federal Open Market Committee

45
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,080
and helps set interest
rates, but she also

46
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,570
is that key player on the
Reserve Board around payments.

47
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:24,880
So she gave a speech
about the updating

48
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,920
and where we stand, and I
hope you found that helpful.

49
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,200
Along with Neha Narula, we did
a cryptocurrency online course

50
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,270
last summer.

51
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,170
And the payment system
space was something

52
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:42,340
we wrote just as a background,
as a primer in this area,

53
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,370
and then some payment
innovations in the FinTech

54
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:50,230
space, and a little map
about nine payment track.

55
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,160
So I hope that was helpful.

56
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,480
If you haven't dug into it, I
do think that Lael's speech is

57
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,430
a good update as to where we
are and particularly as the US

58
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,160
Federal Reserve is thinking
about things like Facebook's

59
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:08,050
Libra, thinking about going
to real-time gross settlement

60
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,530
in something called FedNow
that won't be rolled out now

61
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,420
for three or four years.

62
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,240
But I think Lael gives a good
sense of where things are.

63
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:23,380
So just if we can have a little
bit of conversation here,

64
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,480
and Romain will help facilitate.

65
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,090
But what are the key
challenges and opportunities

66
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,750
in the current system, just
from your own perspective?

67
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,330
In essence, what do
you think I will later

68
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,040
have on that list
of pain points,

69
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,380
if you've not yet
downloaded the slides?

70
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,586
But Romain.

71
00:03:42,586 --> 00:03:46,572
ROMAIN: Let's see who will be
the first volunteer for today.

72
00:03:46,572 --> 00:03:51,322
GARY GENSLER: Just to get
it a little bit interesting.

73
00:03:51,322 --> 00:03:53,350
ROMAIN: Still waiting
for a blue hand.

74
00:03:58,718 --> 00:03:59,218
Hassan.

75
00:03:59,218 --> 00:04:00,510
GARY GENSLER: [INAUDIBLE] page.

76
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,820
You might have to get one.

77
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,950
What did you have, Romain?

78
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,200
ROMAIN: Hassan,
the floor is yours.

79
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,320
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

80
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,990
Yeah, about the
payment system, I've

81
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:14,030
noticed that there is kind of
a monopoly, especially here

82
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:14,930
in the Middle East.

83
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,690
All the payments
are, or I would say

84
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:23,450
almost all payments are through
Visa, and Mastercard, and AMEX.

85
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,120
And if you can see
that, these companies

86
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,670
take a percentage
of the merchants.

87
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,670
And I don't if you guys
have this in the States,

88
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:36,500
but sometimes, for instance,
in my country in Bahrain,

89
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,730
if I would go and buy something,
if I know the owner person,

90
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:44,270
he would say, hey, listen,
if you would pay me in cash,

91
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,560
I could give you a discount.

92
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,840
So I think that there are many
opportunities for companies

93
00:04:50,840 --> 00:05:00,570
that could maybe take less money
and exploit this opportunity.

94
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:03,090
GARY GENSLER: So this
captured two themes

95
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:05,890
that you picked up there,
and there were many others.

96
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,540
And I see Andrea's hand up.

97
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,630
So we'll have some
other good discussions.

98
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:13,530
Cost, you're saying that
the current payment rails--

99
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,750
my word-- that the
current payment rails

100
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,700
have a significant cost.

101
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,030
And you also mentioned
the concentration.

102
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,860
You said monopoly.

103
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,490
Some might say oligopolies,
but there's a concentration

104
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,380
usually in the payment systems.

105
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,740
And this comes by
and large not only

106
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,270
because of the
history of payments

107
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,420
but also the significant
network effects,

108
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:40,500
that if you have one central
payment mechanism, whether it's

109
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,260
a clearing house in days of
old or, in the last 40 years,

110
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:50,250
the credit card companies became
very significant in the payment

111
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,180
space.

112
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,910
They had network
effects, scale, bringing

113
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:57,810
merchants on the one side, the
store owners on the one side,

114
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,400
and the consumers on
the other side together.

115
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,930
And the platform economics
create a significant network

116
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:04,450
effect.

117
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:06,360
So there's a lot
of concentration.

118
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,275
But Andrea or others?

119
00:06:08,275 --> 00:06:09,766
ROMAIN: Andrea?

120
00:06:09,766 --> 00:06:10,830
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

121
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,980
So I'm not fully sure
if this is related

122
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,650
or if you count it
also as payment.

123
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,890
But I think one of the
biggest opportunities

124
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,860
and also challenges
is still to resolve

125
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,410
the international
payments, so basically

126
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,540
how you send the money
across the borders.

127
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:28,080
There are many startups, like
everyone knows TransferWise

128
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,820
who are doing a great job.

129
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,800
But when you think
about it, it's still--

130
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,690
the way their business
model or how it works,

131
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:38,290
it's still not basically
instant sending of money,

132
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:40,150
and there are a
couple of limitations.

133
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,720
For example, you
also need to do it--

134
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,840
you also need to
or you're allowed

135
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,550
to send the money
internationally

136
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,060
if you have a bank account.

137
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,240
But I, for example, know I
was working in the Middle East

138
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,470
where, for example,
there is a lot of people,

139
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:59,280
a lot of international people
coming and working there.

140
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,250
And they are sending
a lot of money

141
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,040
back to their families home.

142
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,860
And, for example, a lot of them
don't have a banking account.

143
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,715
So they're using services
such as Western Union.

144
00:07:10,715 --> 00:07:12,090
GARY GENSLER: So let's--

145
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,230
AUDIENCE: And [INAUDIBLE].

146
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,813
GARY GENSLER: I think
Andrea was good.

147
00:07:14,813 --> 00:07:16,770
She raised three
points in there.

148
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,730
I see Ivy's hand,
and then we'll close.

149
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:22,440
But the three points I heard,
cross-border, sending payments

150
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,090
from one nation to another.

151
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:29,340
Now that could be because
it's moving from one currency

152
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,670
to another, or even if
it's in the same currency,

153
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:35,410
if you're using US dollars
and sending it cross-border

154
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:39,230
or using Euro or yen and
sending it cross-border,

155
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:42,510
you're jumping between two
different payment systems, two

156
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,740
different banking systems.

157
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,360
And so cross-border same
currency or cross-border

158
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,970
cross currency, there's
a significant amount

159
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,160
of cost embedded in that.

160
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,380
There is time delays that
Andrea mentioned until you

161
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,380
can have settled money.

162
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,920
Final settled money means
that you can actually use it

163
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,610
in your commercial daily lives.

164
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:11,490
And then thirdly, I think
Andrea raised inclusion,

165
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,680
whether everybody has
access to that system.

166
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,570
So I thank you.

167
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:18,152
And then Ivy, and
then we'll move on.

168
00:08:18,152 --> 00:08:18,892
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

169
00:08:18,892 --> 00:08:20,350
I actually had some
earlier points.

170
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:25,160
But I think just building up
off of that, things like Plaid,

171
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,460
I think, are quite interesting
because you really need this--

172
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:34,470
I guess I think about it as the
plumbing of the payment system,

173
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,440
if you will, because
they really need

174
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,700
to plug into so many different
types, the payment systems, all

175
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,530
these different
financial institutions.

176
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:47,270
And just even thinking about
inclusion and consumer--

177
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:50,120
customer behavior and
consumer credit behavior

178
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,820
or cross-countries,
it's entirely different.

179
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,520
Like people in the UK don't,
or in Europe in general,

180
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:01,340
I don't think, use credit
cards as much as Americans do.

181
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,820
People in Asia are really
used to using Alipay, WeChat.

182
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:08,270
QR codes have
become a big thing.

183
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:12,650
And in Canada, people
pay down their debt

184
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,425
much faster than we do.

185
00:09:14,425 --> 00:09:15,800
So just trying to
think about how

186
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,950
all these different players,
both on the consumer side

187
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:23,030
as well as on the supply
side, if you will,

188
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,320
will fit into the entire
system in the future.

189
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,680
GARY GENSLER: So Ivy's
mentioned a bunch

190
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,380
of cultural and
geographic differences.

191
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,290
Country by country,
we have differences

192
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:35,180
in our payment systems.

193
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,520
We have different cultural
behaviors about paying down

194
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,410
our debt and so forth.

195
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:43,520
And you mentioned one company,
Plaid, that helps the plumbing.

196
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:48,650
And what's interesting is
that the word "plumbing"

197
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:54,170
in banking or plumbing and
payment is an age old thought.

198
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,510
Actually, when
Alexander Hamilton,

199
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:00,590
our nation's first
Secretary of the Treasury,

200
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:03,860
helped found one of the
first banks in the nation,

201
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:07,160
the Bank of New York-- it still
is part of the Bank of New York

202
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:12,110
Mellon-- this was in the 1780s,
they took as their logo--

203
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,640
logo is a modern word.

204
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,370
But they took as
their symbol something

205
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:19,160
that looked like
plumbing, literally

206
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,620
that they thought of
banking as like waterworks

207
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:26,810
or a central utility, sending
money around rather than

208
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:29,090
sending water around.

209
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,340
So I thank you for that.

210
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,570
But yes, Plaid is
part of that plumbing.

211
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,580
And as Andrea said,
TransferWise is

212
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,490
trying to find a gap
in the cross-border.

213
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:38,440
They're not alone.

214
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:43,610
There's Remitly and WorldRemit,
and many other companies also.

215
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,950
And so this is a long question.

216
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,230
But just anybody want to
say, what lessons can you

217
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:52,160
take from Big Tech in
this space, Alipay,

218
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,670
WeChat Pay, M-Pesa, et
cetera, just Big Tech?

219
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:59,790
And secondly, any lessons
from all the startups.

220
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:03,320
So it's two buckets,
but it's what can you

221
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,780
take from the competitive
landscape, either Big

222
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,460
Tech or the disruptors?

223
00:11:12,564 --> 00:11:13,510
ROMAIN: Anyone?

224
00:11:17,956 --> 00:11:20,890
GARY GENSLER: I'm sure that
some of you use these companies,

225
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:24,480
whether you're from Asia, and
you use many of the Big Tech

226
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,490
ones, or even in
the US if you do,

227
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:32,640
or you're bound to use Venmo,
which is owned by PayPal,

228
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,940
or something.

229
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:37,740
ROMAIN: So we have
Luke and then Yi.

230
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,040
AUDIENCE: So one of the--

231
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,957
GARY GENSLER: Which side
are you [INAUDIBLE],,

232
00:11:40,957 --> 00:11:42,465
Big Tech or disruptors?

233
00:11:42,465 --> 00:11:43,315
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry.

234
00:11:43,315 --> 00:11:43,940
Say that again.

235
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,732
Say that again now.

236
00:11:44,732 --> 00:11:49,336
GARY GENSLER: Are you addressing
Big Tech or the disruptors?

237
00:11:49,336 --> 00:11:51,410
AUDIENCE: So let's
go with Big Tech,

238
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,910
but I guess it's not to
easy when I talk about,

239
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:58,310
for example, KakaoPay, which
is the payment platform made

240
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:01,850
by Kakao Group, which
is the largest--

241
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:04,730
the tech company in Korea.

242
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:07,680
And basically, it's
WhatsApp of Korea.

243
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,200
So whether it be KakaoPay, or
WeChat Pay, Alipay, Apple Pay,

244
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:17,210
the key thing is it's very,
very easy compared to the bank.

245
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,610
Now, the banks are trying to
catch up with the API Open

246
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,320
Banking system and all that.

247
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,250
But basically, the
UI user interface

248
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,030
is pretty easy to use.

249
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:29,750
And if you have a problem, if
you contact customer service,

250
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:34,140
they'll contact you
right away, versus banks

251
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,140
make you wait 20 minutes,
blah, blah, blah.

252
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:39,040
Sad to say it as a banker,
but it is what it is.

253
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,457
GARY GENSLER: So I think that
the key lesson you're saying

254
00:12:41,457 --> 00:12:44,240
is it's easier, it's
got a user interface

255
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,720
that's quite convenient.

256
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,350
And while you didn't use the
word, it's also ubiquitous.

257
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:56,800
And so KakaoPay in Korea,
LINE Pay in Japan and Taiwan,

258
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,990
WeChat Pay, Alipay,
M-Pesa really

259
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,850
leapfrog the banking system.

260
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:04,730
But there is a very established
banking system in Korea.

261
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:08,960
And yet still,
KakaoPay leaped over.

262
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,090
Not as much so in the US.

263
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,860
I mean, yes, Google
Wallet is there.

264
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,650
Yes, Apple Pay is there,
and they're significant.

265
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,452
Less so for Facebook actually.

266
00:13:17,452 --> 00:13:19,160
AUDIENCE: I think
that's because of the--

267
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,050
GARY GENSLER:
[INAUDIBLE] we're weaker,

268
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:26,210
in a sense, adoption, Google,
Apple, Facebook in the US,

269
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:30,595
than we find in Korea or China.

270
00:13:30,595 --> 00:13:31,970
AUDIENCE: But I
think that's more

271
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,820
because of-- not
because of overbanking

272
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,080
or the power of bank.

273
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,200
It's more because of
the telecom services,

274
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,950
how reachable,
approachable you are

275
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:45,870
with the LTE speed or
3G speed you have here

276
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,725
in big land of America.

277
00:13:47,725 --> 00:13:49,790
GARY GENSLER: So
what Luke's raising

278
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:53,600
is there's also facts on the
ground about how developed

279
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,780
the technology is, whether
it was already at 3G or 4G

280
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:00,660
or how developed the
technology was on the ground.

281
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,810
So it's not just about
how developed the banking

282
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:05,050
system is but also technology.

283
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:07,010
Romain, we had
somebody else that

284
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,780
might take the disrupter side.

285
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,480
Thank you, Luke.

286
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:09,880
ROMAIN: Yes.

287
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,672
GARY GENSLER: Good.

288
00:14:10,672 --> 00:14:11,594
ROMAIN: Yi, go ahead.

289
00:14:11,594 --> 00:14:12,520
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

290
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,370
I just want to raise a trend,
the loss of the payments

291
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:16,900
this time.

292
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,960
GARY GENSLER: And then,
Yi, do we have a video?

293
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,275
Do we have your face?

294
00:14:21,275 --> 00:14:22,170
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

295
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:24,370
I'm just very ugly
this morning, but--

296
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:26,731
GARY GENSLER: Oh, I'm
sure you look fine.

297
00:14:26,731 --> 00:14:27,356
You look great.

298
00:14:27,356 --> 00:14:28,420
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

299
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:34,240
So I just feel like there's
a key trend between the--

300
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,390
even including the Big Tech
payment firms as well as like

301
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:41,530
the FinTech firm
is social media.

302
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:44,620
People want to pay
via the social media.

303
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,220
This happened between
the Alipay, WeChat Pay,

304
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,990
the KakaoPay, and
also the Venmo.

305
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,470
You can connect with friends.

306
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,800
You can send stickers.

307
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,320
You can send--
express your emotions.

308
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,230
You can make your
transactions available

309
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,820
to your social network.

310
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:04,700
And I think there's also
similar to M-Pesa in Kenya.

311
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,460
So I feel like this
is a huge trend

312
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:11,030
that people don't
want to only make

313
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:14,050
the transaction
with banks, which is

314
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:16,880
very separate and individual.

315
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,110
They want to make transactions
with their social network.

316
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,030
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

317
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:22,960
I think that's right.

318
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,860
I think that's probably a
larger factor with regard

319
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,650
to the Big Tech companies,
but it is also true

320
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:34,390
that it's a factor
with the startups.

321
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:38,800
And then lastly, a
question is, do you

322
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,740
think stable value
coins, tokenized assets,

323
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:46,030
even the initiative of Libra--

324
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:49,360
what will that do on
this payment space?

325
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,835
In essence, are they
hype or a passing fad,

326
00:15:51,835 --> 00:15:53,460
or are they going to
do something here?

327
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:58,910
Romain?

328
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,270
ROMAIN: Any opinions on this?

329
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,750
I'm still waiting.

330
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,590
GARY GENSLER: We're
going to help out.

331
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,590
We're going to help out.

332
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,280
We have a poll.

333
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:12,750
This is exactly when we can
ask a poll to tease this out.

334
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:16,160
You've done terrific, but no one
answer, because now, Romain's

335
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,190
going to pull up a poll.

336
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:21,430
And this is more broadly-- this
is about blockchain technology,

337
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:25,430
but curious what
everyone thinks here.

338
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:27,243
ROMAIN: So you
should now see a poll

339
00:16:27,243 --> 00:16:29,160
with three different
questions on your screen.

340
00:16:32,088 --> 00:16:34,610
GARY GENSLER: This is a
little bit more broadly as

341
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,160
to whether financial
firms will incorporate

342
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,730
blockchain technology into
their business models.

343
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:44,780
As they've already incorporated
AI and machine learning,

344
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:47,810
as they've been
incorporating open API,

345
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:51,380
will this be a fundamental
feature in the next 2,

346
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,480
5, or 10 years, or not at all?

347
00:16:57,304 --> 00:17:00,220
ROMAIN: 20% of the
class voted so far.

348
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,810
Please check the
window and vote.

349
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:10,319
GARY GENSLER: Romain,
I like your ability

350
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,609
to pull in the votes.

351
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:16,500
You might have a job
to do come November

352
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,780
in our next general
election here.

353
00:17:23,091 --> 00:17:26,160
ROMAIN: Are you confident
it's going to take place?

354
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,030
GARY GENSLER: Yes.

355
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:30,210
I am confident under our
constitutional system

356
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:31,815
that we will have an election.

357
00:17:31,815 --> 00:17:34,010
ROMAIN: Excellent.

358
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:34,530
OK.

359
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,170
We have 70% of the
class that has voted.

360
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,810
I'm going to let
5 more seconds--

361
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,520
GARY GENSLER:
[INAUDIBLE] 10 seconds.

362
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,460
ROMAIN: Yeah.

363
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,680
And we reached 80%.

364
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,205
Thank you, everyone, for
sharing your thoughts.

365
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:53,580
I'm sharing the
results with you.

366
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,790
You should now be
able to see them.

367
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:59,120
GARY GENSLER: So let's
see, that the class tends

368
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,150
to be optimistic that blockchain
technology will be incorporated

369
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:07,310
in, even though it might
take 5 to 10 years.

370
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:15,250
It looks like the mode is
5 years or 5 or 10 years.

371
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:20,810
In terms of, what
will it have will be--

372
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:24,560
beyond speculative digital
store valuable Bitcoin

373
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:28,716
become the currency of choice
in some part of the economy,

374
00:18:28,716 --> 00:18:33,140
that generally 60-some% say no.

375
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,270
And then, who is
Satoshi Nakamoto?

376
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:39,440
Well, that was just
my one little question

377
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,860
because, of course, we don't
know who Satoshi Nakamoto is,

378
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:47,900
this woman or man who wrote
the eight-page white paper

379
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,890
and put it out on the
internet 12 years ago.

380
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,530
But it looks like
a third of you said

381
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,900
maybe it was a
foreign state actor,

382
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,210
or 20% said US intelligence.

383
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,050
OK.

384
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:05,090
So let's get back to payments,
I like this thought there.

385
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:08,000
If you want to take that
window, you have to, I think,

386
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,410
get rid of the
poll individually,

387
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,130
which I'm about to do now--

388
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,690
ROMAIN: Yes, thank you.

389
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:16,530
GARY GENSLER: --as well.

390
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:20,040
So what is a payment system?

391
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,450
Let's just dive in and
talk about what it is.

392
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:26,760
And it's been around a century.

393
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,830
So it's not a new thing.

394
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:32,760
But in a digital world,
in a ledger-based world,

395
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:37,170
it's a method to
change a ledger.

396
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,670
Now, this isn't an
accounting class.

397
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,420
I'm not going to bore
you with accounting.

398
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,480
But basically, if I'm
moving money to you,

399
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,910
somebody has to lower my
account, credit my account.

400
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:50,680
Remember assets or debits.

401
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,970
So credit means it's
going down, a little bit

402
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:55,680
of accounting here.

403
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:59,040
And then somebody else's
account has to be debited.

404
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,350
So one debit, one credit.

405
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:04,590
One account goes down,
one account goes up.

406
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:09,630
It's also about authorizing
those movements and then

407
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:12,270
what's called clearing
and final settlement.

408
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,050
And earlier we discussed that--

409
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,960
and sometimes final
settlement doesn't

410
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,080
happen for a couple of days.

411
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,660
And a long time ago, if
you wrote a physical check,

412
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,610
you might not have
it settled, meaning

413
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:29,310
having money in your account
for five days or longer even.

414
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:32,270
Now it's closer to two days.

415
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:36,000
But it's basically amending
and recording those ledgers.

416
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,920
That's what it is in
an accounting system.

417
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,780
And so how did we do this?

418
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,550
This is just some
fun background,

419
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:46,230
but Thomas Jefferson, the
writer of the Declaration

420
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:49,680
of Independence, actually
you can find online a check

421
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,890
he wrote to himself.

422
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,370
I'm not quite sure why he did.

423
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:56,420
This would have been the
year after he was president,

424
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,230
but he wrote a check to himself.

425
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:02,020
So physical personal checks
have been around a long time,

426
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,540
but they are basically
an instruction

427
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,930
called negotiable
orders of withdrawal,

428
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:10,180
but an instruction to a
bank to amend the ledger.

429
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:13,590
Lower my ledger, and
give me maybe paper cash,

430
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:16,320
or lower my ledger,
raise somebody else's.

431
00:21:18,925 --> 00:21:20,800
All of the sudden, the
telegraph comes along.

432
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,710
And a company, Western
Union, which still exists--

433
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:28,210
Western Union comes along,
and it's a telegram company.

434
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:32,260
But they figure out how to
send money by telegraph,

435
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,450
the FinTech of its time.

436
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:36,970
And yes, there were
machines that looked

437
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,710
like this, telex machines.

438
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:43,000
These were ubiquitous across
financial firms in the 1950s

439
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,590
to the 1970s.

440
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:47,830
I will admit I saw one or two of
these when I was on Wall Street

441
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:50,020
still in the 1980s.

442
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:53,710
But a telex machine
existed basically

443
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:59,212
to send instructions on
payments around to another bank.

444
00:21:59,212 --> 00:22:01,680
But what's it look like today?

445
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,170
Well, first, the
important thing is

446
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:08,010
central banks sit in the
middle of payment systems.

447
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:12,180
This was not as true
in terms of the--

448
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:15,900
I'm just trying to move
a window out of the way.

449
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:21,270
This was not as true in the
physical coin and currency

450
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,170
world.

451
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:25,830
But here, this little chart puts
the central bank at the top.

452
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:29,370
And we have central banks around
the globe, 180 different Fiat

453
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:30,780
currencies.

454
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:35,730
The central banks are
central to commercial banks.

455
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:41,490
And what's important to
remember is our money system

456
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:47,670
has moved on from being
paper money to basically

457
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,050
digital money.

458
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,360
And so today in the
US, if you think

459
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,450
about the total
stock of currency,

460
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:57,690
the total stock
of paper currency

461
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:02,100
prior to this coronavirus
crisis was about $1.8 trillion.

462
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,610
It's actually gone
up in the last month.

463
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:08,310
It seems that there are people
that want to take cash out

464
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:13,300
of the bank, out of the
ATM as a store of value

465
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,200
around the globe.

466
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,640
We're not using it.

467
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,440
It's a disease vector, but
it seems that the growth--

468
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,460
and it might be
now $1.9 trillion.

469
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:27,070
So it's gone up $100
billion or approximately.

470
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:30,850
But the digital money, all the
people's bank accounts, bank

471
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:34,990
deposits, money market funds
is multiples of that, $15

472
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:37,300
or so trillion.

473
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:41,350
So about 90% of the
money in the US,

474
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:44,680
depending upon your definition
of money, is digital.

475
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,950
And most of that digital money
is commercial bank money.

476
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,870
You and I, when we
go into Starbucks,

477
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:55,270
we're basically spending Bank
America dollars, or Citibank

478
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:58,660
dollars, or Wells Fargo
dollars, or SunTrust dollars,

479
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,580
or Community Bank dollar.

480
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:03,740
That's what we're spending
when we walk into Starbucks.

481
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:07,010
It might have some implicit
or explicit guarantee

482
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:11,440
of a government here in the US,
deposit insurance and the like.

483
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,140
But we're in essence saying
to Bank of America, please

484
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:17,110
change my ledger
balance and move

485
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:19,570
something to somebody
else's ledger balance,

486
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:24,460
maybe a Community Bank
for that local Starbucks.

487
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:27,550
So in between has to be
some electronic means,

488
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:31,210
some payments system, a
deferred net settlement system.

489
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:34,390
And this chart lists
the number of them.

490
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:40,830
These payment systems are
the domain of central banks.

491
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:43,200
Some central banks
actually run them,

492
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,640
like the US Federal Reserve runs
something called the Fedwire.

493
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:55,180
But some are run by a consortium
of the commercial banks.

494
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,090
Some are private.

495
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:59,920
And in some countries, they
can even be for-profit.

496
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:03,040
But all of them
have some regulation

497
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,160
from the central bank.

498
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,150
So either the central bank
owns them or the central bank

499
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:08,900
oversees them.

500
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,540
And usually then
the commercial banks

501
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:14,650
might run these
single purpose payment

502
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,210
systems around the globe.

503
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:18,100
Some countries have
multiple systems.

504
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,340
The US, we have the
Fed system, and we also

505
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:24,410
have something called the
automated clearing house.

506
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:27,820
The clearing house was
founded in the 1850s

507
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:31,450
to give you a sense of its
history, a long history.

508
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:34,668
Questions, Romain, any?

509
00:25:34,668 --> 00:25:35,970
ROMAIN: None so far, Gary.

510
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:36,310
GARY GENSLER: All right.

511
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:38,030
So you'll see how
this fits together.

512
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:44,300
But let me say what the modern
payment system looks like when

513
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:49,250
I think of it in terms
of you go into Starbucks,

514
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:52,280
and you want to make a payment.

515
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,700
You're the consumer.

516
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,920
We're going to go across.

517
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,240
You have an issuing bank.

518
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,710
Let's use Bank of
America just to say.

519
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:01,340
And you're giving that
bank, Bank of America,

520
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:04,150
a payment instruction.

521
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:06,700
Now, in an earlier day, you
could write a physical check,

522
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,430
like Thomas Jefferson's check.

523
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:13,780
You could use a credit card, a
debit card, some prepaid card.

524
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:17,020
But you have to give
some payment instruction.

525
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:19,285
Even that QR code
that you pass--

526
00:26:19,285 --> 00:26:23,860
and we'll get to Alipay and
WeChat Pay in a moment--

527
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:26,290
there is a payment
instruction somewhere,

528
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:28,710
digital payment instruction.

529
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:31,840
And then at the heart in
the middle is a network.

530
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,290
Now, these payment
service providers, PSPs,

531
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:38,890
in the middle or networks could
be associated with a credit

532
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:42,370
card company, the Visa
credit card network

533
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:45,865
founded in the late
1950s by Bank of America,

534
00:26:45,865 --> 00:26:47,800
a California bank at the time.

535
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,700
And it became ubiquitous
by the late 1960s.

536
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:56,920
Visa, Mastercard,
UnionPay in China

537
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:00,310
can both be credit
cards and networks,

538
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:03,610
or there could be a network
that services the credit cards.

539
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:07,250
But you need something
in the middle

540
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,890
because on the other side,
there's tens of thousands

541
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:14,900
of merchants or millions of
merchants if you go to China.

542
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:18,130
And on their side,
they have another bank.

543
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:22,870
But they need some way to access
this network, a point of sale--

544
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:24,850
POS is point of sale--

545
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:28,570
or by phone or by some
modern mechanism to access

546
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:30,350
that network.

547
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:34,430
And then the merchant
on the other side.

548
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:38,830
So you have consumer
all the way to merchant.

549
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:41,740
You have banks,
the issuing bank.

550
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:44,880
The issuing bank is that
party that says, all right,

551
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,250
I'm going to take a
payment instruction.

552
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,650
And you have the merchant
bank on the other side

553
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:53,310
or acquire a bank,
sometimes it's called.

554
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:56,860
But in the middle,
there's some network.

555
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,830
And it leads to a
lot of concentration

556
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:02,710
because there's such
significant economic and network

557
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:07,850
effects in a modern
digital payment system.

558
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:08,350
Questions.

559
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:08,800
ROMAIN: Yes.

560
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,633
We have questions from
Carlos and then Jose.

561
00:28:10,633 --> 00:28:12,540
GARY GENSLER: Please.

562
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,460
AUDIENCE: Hi.

563
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:17,100
So I wanted to ask, I know in
a lot of developing markets

564
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,010
now making the-- since
you mentioned the ACH,

565
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:22,620
making it real-time
is a big focus

566
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,780
and using different
technologies, right?

567
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:29,160
So could you explain, I guess,
the magnitude of difference

568
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:33,120
that having a real-time ACH
system versus not makes?

569
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,900
GARY GENSLER: We're going to
dive into this in about a half

570
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,240
an hour, but let me try
it very quickly, Carlos.

571
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,577
And then remind me
as we get back to it.

572
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:49,000
As a merchant, there's
a value to getting

573
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,830
final settlement when
you sell your coffee

574
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:57,520
or sell your produce or
a big machine, whatever

575
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,660
you're selling.

576
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:03,320
And there's the value
because there's certainty,

577
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,790
and there's also timing.

578
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:07,640
So if you can get your cash on
Monday rather than Wednesday,

579
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,140
there's a value to it.

580
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:12,830
Payment systems around
the globe historically

581
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:16,670
could give you final settlement
if you used physical cash.

582
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:20,720
And physical cash under the
laws of the developed world

583
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,980
became final settlement
from the earliest days.

584
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:27,740
There's a famous lawsuit
from the Crawford case,

585
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:30,770
if you ever want to look it up,
about final settlement using

586
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:31,670
physical cash.

587
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:36,800
It's from the days of
King George II, I think.

588
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:41,690
But digitally, it was harder
to get final settlement,

589
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:43,830
and we still have delays.

590
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:46,760
So what's happened
in the last 25

591
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,100
years is many nations
have said, can we

592
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,790
get to real-time
settlement rather

593
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:55,760
than delayed settlement
of one day, two days,

594
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,830
or, in the old days, five days?

595
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:00,110
And trying to get to
that real-time settlement

596
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,130
has been a challenge.

597
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:03,660
And we'll go through different
countries in about a half

598
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,160
an hour.

599
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,450
Let me hold that.

600
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,940
But a lot of countries,
central banks around the globe

601
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:10,130
are trying to get to
real-time settlement.

602
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:14,810
But the value is to the merchant
that they have finality,

603
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:18,120
that they can then use
those funds in some way.

604
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,210
And I can tell you, even when I
was the chief financial officer

605
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:24,530
of the Hillary Clinton
campaign in 2016,

606
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:25,490
we had to deal with it.

607
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,760
We were the merchant
on the right-hand side.

608
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,680
We might get a donation.

609
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:34,690
But until that donation
actually settled,

610
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:37,840
sometimes several days later,
sometimes a day later--

611
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,120
it was different
settlement cycles--

612
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,490
but until that settled,
we couldn't actually

613
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:46,630
use it to buy advertisements
on, let's say,

614
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,850
Facebook or Google Ads.

615
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:51,790
So we needed-- even
in that instance,

616
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:54,580
particularly when you get down
to the last six or 10 days

617
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:58,150
before election time,
those days matter.

618
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:00,580
So I lived this as a--

619
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,296
other questions?

620
00:31:02,296 --> 00:31:04,895
ROMAIN: Yes, Jose?

621
00:31:04,895 --> 00:31:05,770
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

622
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:08,400
So I'm not sure if this is a bit
out of the scope of the class,

623
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,560
but I've always been
very curious on,

624
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:14,540
why are checks so
prevalent in the US?

625
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,805
So, for example, in Spain, I've
never used a check in my life.

626
00:31:17,805 --> 00:31:19,680
And I think it
doesn't seem to be

627
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,180
a very efficient
way of transferring

628
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,360
money versus, for
example, a wire transfer.

629
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,830
But in the US, it seems like
banks sometimes charge more

630
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:29,515
for wire transfers, and
they require more security,

631
00:31:29,515 --> 00:31:31,890
passwords and things for a
wire transfer than for checks.

632
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:32,220
GARY GENSLER: So it's--

633
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,420
AUDIENCE: And I don't
really understand why.

634
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:36,060
GARY GENSLER: --very much part--
it's part of the pain points,

635
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:40,770
and each country has a little
bit different heritage.

636
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:43,710
Of course, through the
1960s, physical checks

637
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:48,240
were very a important dominant
part of many payment systems.

638
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,260
It was only in the 1990s
that the US government

639
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:56,910
said by an Act of Congress
that the US government should

640
00:31:56,910 --> 00:32:02,400
move to electronic
payment of social security

641
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,190
and other important parts
that government pays money.

642
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:08,550
But even then, the
adoption was supposed

643
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:12,390
to be by the late 1990s, and
there was various exemptions

644
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:14,280
and so forth installed.

645
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,080
And so we even see
now, in the middle

646
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,430
of the corona crisis, that you
can read in today's newspapers

647
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:23,400
that the $1,200
that's moving out

648
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:28,980
of our tax authority, the IRS,
to individuals, while the bulk

649
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,270
of that's electronic--

650
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:32,070
80 or 90 million
of those will be

651
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:34,050
electronic-- it's estimated
that there's still

652
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:39,150
millions of people that will
get physical checks in the US.

653
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:42,240
So we still have this
legacy that's probably

654
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,500
a little bit more dominant.

655
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,890
I'm going to show
some statistics

656
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:48,330
on check uses in a moment.

657
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:49,770
Some of it's cultural.

658
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:52,320
Some of it's
actually commercial.

659
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,890
At the middle of
all this are banks.

660
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:58,890
And in the middle is these
networks in the middle.

661
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:01,260
So it's not only
cultural, but it's

662
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:05,790
also sometimes hard
for a merchant to say,

663
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:07,290
I want to pay--

664
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:11,440
the merchant, remember,
has to pay the 2 and 1/2%

665
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,430
cost if you're going
to be accepting Visa.

666
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:19,110
So the cost of interchange
fees, the cost the credit card

667
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:24,504
companies are taking here in the
US average around 2 and 3/4%,

668
00:33:24,504 --> 00:33:26,580
2.75%.

669
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,710
So a lot of merchants
still would prefer

670
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:32,500
to take a check than that 2.75.

671
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,770
You go over to China,
and you say, well,

672
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:37,290
within the Alipay,
WeChat Pay systems,

673
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:40,540
the costs are
significantly lower.

674
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:45,150
In fact, if you're all within
service, within system,

675
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,950
it's 0%.

676
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:49,690
In India, I think it's
around 10 basis points.

677
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:52,800
So there's a lot of
reasons a merchant might

678
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,380
say, all right, I might
prefer if you can give me

679
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,850
an ACH or a check.

680
00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:00,630
So gives you a
little background.

681
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:03,300
But layered on
top of this system

682
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:06,480
is all these digital
wallets, an invention really

683
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,920
just of the last 20 years.

684
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:15,130
And whether it's here in the
US or overseas, a lot of these

685
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:17,770
are related to Big
Tech, not only,

686
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:19,719
but a lot are
related to Big Tech.

687
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:24,550
And then the question is, will
cryptocurrency play some role?

688
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:31,179
Can crypto skip some of these
inefficiencies and play a role?

689
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:34,840
And so with that, some of the
trends, just a quick look.

690
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,630
And this goes to the--
this is from a report.

691
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:40,929
Worldpay, which is a
big payment company,

692
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:43,690
puts out an annual
report each year.

693
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:46,570
And this is their most
recent report that

694
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:49,960
came out in February of 2020.

695
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,330
But around the
globe, mobile wallets

696
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:56,622
are estimated to already be
42% of global e-commerce.

697
00:34:56,622 --> 00:34:57,580
Now, this is important.

698
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,080
This is e-commerce.

699
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,450
If you go off to the
big wholesale payments

700
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:04,220
or large value payments,
different story.

701
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:08,410
But this is electronic payments
in the e-commerce space

702
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:10,960
and then point of sale payments.

703
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,370
Cash is still a pretty big
piece of the worldwide global

704
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:19,240
environment for point of
sale, whereas e-commerce,

705
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:23,170
basically online using your
mobile phone or your laptop--

706
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:25,330
can't really use cash much--

707
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:29,560
cash on delivery is still 4 and
1/2%, though, interestingly.

708
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,440
That's Worldpay's
overall view, but they

709
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:36,510
say credit card will
decline, debit cards

710
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:40,980
decline, bank
transfers about even.

711
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,570
And so what's increasing?

712
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:44,070
Digital mobile wallets.

713
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:47,340
And then, of course, at point
of sale, cash declining.

714
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:51,450
And there you will see
increases in their estimation.

715
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:53,650
But the US is a
little different.

716
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:57,210
The US or North America,
which is the best statistics

717
00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:00,060
I can grab off the
Worldpay, we still

718
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,670
have a significant
amount of credit card.

719
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:03,690
Look at that.

720
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:06,030
Credit card's still a third.

721
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:09,040
Digital mobile wallet's 23%.

722
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,690
And from a merchant's
point of view,

723
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:13,560
they would prefer actually
to have something that

724
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,170
takes the less bite out of it.

725
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:19,410
Here in the US,
debit cards by an Act

726
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:23,980
of Congress after
the 2008 crisis--

727
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,960
Carl Levin, a Senator
from Illinois,

728
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:30,010
said, we should make sure
that debit cards do not--

729
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:35,230
and banks issuing debit cards
can't charge more than the cost

730
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:37,090
of actually issuing
that debit card.

731
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:39,070
And after a series
of rule makings

732
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:42,340
by the central bank, the Federal
Reserve, that settled out.

733
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,680
But debit cards are
a little less costly

734
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:49,450
than credit cards for the banks.

735
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:52,780
And in terms of trends just
in the US specifically,

736
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:56,530
this is from the Federal Reserve
in December of this past year.

737
00:36:56,530 --> 00:37:01,550
But this just gives you
a sense, 20 year history.

738
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:03,610
And this is overall
payment trends.

739
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:05,090
This is not just e-commerce.

740
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:08,160
Checks were 45% 20 years ago.

741
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,730
And you can see that line just
decline, decline, decline.

742
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:13,250
So to Jose's point, we're
not quite there yet.

743
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:17,330
Spain might be down to 5%
on checks or something,

744
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:19,740
but you can see where we are.

745
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:23,690
And this is the number
of payment instructions.

746
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:25,770
This is dollar amounts.

747
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:29,150
So in terms of dollars,
checks only went--

748
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:36,640
lost this parade
eight years ago.

749
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,280
So one is volume of payments.

750
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,610
One is the actual
checks and so forth.

751
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:44,490
And large value payments
are included here.

752
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:47,010
The other charts did not.

753
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:50,580
And just one last thing in terms
of the e-commerce side of it

754
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,860
and card payments,
this just gives you

755
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:57,120
a sense of remote
and in-person, that I

756
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,580
like this right-hand chart.

757
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:02,160
But the trillions
of dollars we move,

758
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,520
we are moving on
our physical cards

759
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,030
more remote than
we are in person.

760
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:11,030
This gives an
opportunity to startups.

761
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:17,180
Startups can say, wait, Visa,
Mastercard in many countries

762
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:20,055
has this 2 and 3/4%.

763
00:38:20,055 --> 00:38:22,740
Maybe we can get
inside that pricing.

764
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:25,020
Maybe we can get
inside especially

765
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:28,290
as we move from in-person
to remote payments

766
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:31,480
as an opportunity.

767
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:35,233
So that brings us to
a list of pain points.

768
00:38:35,233 --> 00:38:35,900
What point are--

769
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:36,250
ROMAIN: Gary?

770
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,667
GARY GENSLER:
--these pain points?

771
00:38:37,667 --> 00:38:38,421
ROMAIN: Perhaps--

772
00:38:38,421 --> 00:38:39,630
GARY GENSLER: Please, Romain.

773
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:41,070
ROMAIN: Actually,
before we move there,

774
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,210
I think Hassan had a question.

775
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:43,470
GARY GENSLER: Please, Hassan.

776
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,472
Hassan, you might need
to take your mute off.

777
00:38:51,472 --> 00:38:54,100
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

778
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,810
About payments,
so, for instance,

779
00:38:56,810 --> 00:39:01,750
you could see we have the
bank transfers and e-wallets.

780
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:05,200
So my question is,
for instance, I

781
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,860
was trying to pay my landlord
while I was in Bahrain,

782
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:12,250
because I still have my
apartment in Cambridge.

783
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:16,390
And if the amount
exceeds a certain number,

784
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:21,050
they have to send me a
message, which can be annoying

785
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:24,740
because if my mobile
isn't working,

786
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,870
they would not send me an email.

787
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:31,400
So is it like the
system, the whole system,

788
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,660
the whole payment system
supports bank transfers

789
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:39,050
when it comes to big
payments and small transfers

790
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:44,656
when it comes to e-wallets
and mobile payments?

791
00:39:44,656 --> 00:39:48,600
GARY GENSLER: Well, I'm
not sure of your question.

792
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:54,240
It is true that ultimately
sitting in the midst of this,

793
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,000
with the risk of going
back a bunch of slides,

794
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,370
there has to be something--

795
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:01,140
well, I'll just stay here.

796
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:06,480
There has to be an instruction
that moves it from an issuing

797
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,170
bank to an acquiring bank.

798
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:11,430
So your landlord would
be the merchant here.

799
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:16,080
Your landlord's bank has to
get an instruction somehow.

800
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,375
So even if it's in this orange
box, the digital wallets

801
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:24,440
at the top, you have to send
an instruction somewhere

802
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:29,090
that takes funds from your
bank, which is called an issuing

803
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:35,060
bank, and somehow moves those
funds to the landlord's bank.

804
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:41,030
And what you're finding
is that your merchant

805
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:44,900
bank, the acquiring bank
on behalf of your landlord,

806
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,540
is saying, listen, if it's
greater than a certain dollar

807
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:51,500
amount, we need a
second security check.

808
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:58,170
And the mobile wallet companies
basically inserted that check,

809
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:00,305
I think is what
you're telling me.

810
00:41:00,305 --> 00:41:01,930
You could have that
same similar thing.

811
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:03,120
Venmo has a limit.

812
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,330
I don't think you could move $1
million on Venmo, for instance.

813
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:11,640
Venmo is a PayPal subsidiary,
and Venmo is actually--

814
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,620
avoids those credit card fees.

815
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:16,530
Venmo is a form of
account to account

816
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:19,800
transfer, your
account at your bank

817
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,150
to somebody else's account.

818
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:25,170
And account to account transfers
are a very important feature

819
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:26,730
of the competition.

820
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:28,980
But still, Venmo is not
going to move $1 million

821
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:33,070
without having additional
security checks.

822
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:37,655
So that's probably what's
happening here, I fear to say.

823
00:41:37,655 --> 00:41:38,430
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

824
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:43,620
I, mean my point is it's a
bit annoying because I would--

825
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:47,580
for instance, because my
mobile is a prepaid mobile.

826
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:50,310
So I could not receive
a message from my bank.

827
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:54,360
GARY GENSLER: Oh, well, I
can't solve that for you here,

828
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,030
but I think that's part
of what you're saying.

829
00:41:57,030 --> 00:42:02,850
That's part of these pain
points is that fraud.

830
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:07,260
Basically, when you think
of all the pain points,

831
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:14,250
you and I, as users, we want
something that's easy to use,

832
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:15,540
nearly costless.

833
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,250
We're willing to
spend something,

834
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:20,670
but we'd prefer not to spend
2% to 3% of our purchases

835
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:22,650
on the payment system.

836
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:26,310
And we want it not
to have complexity,

837
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:30,210
the cross-border payments
that we talked about earlier.

838
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:32,880
We kind of know that
they're tracking us,

839
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,130
they're getting our data,
but we're a little concerned

840
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:36,940
about data privacy.

841
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:41,370
And so you're capturing one of
the pain points around fraud.

842
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:43,510
And that's from
the merchant side.

843
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:45,150
The merchant doesn't
want the fraud,

844
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:46,500
but also you don't want it.

845
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:50,460
You don't want somebody to be
able to tap into your account

846
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,110
and move your money out.

847
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:55,080
And the pain point sounds
like the fraud detection

848
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:59,070
system that your bank is using
is requiring your mobile phone

849
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:02,220
in a way that's friction.

850
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,650
It's frankly friction.

851
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:06,570
It's similar to a pain point--

852
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:09,810
it used to be until
very recently,

853
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:15,780
if you traveled overseas, you
were better to tell your bank

854
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:19,620
that you were going to be using
your credit card in Spain,

855
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:23,790
or France, or Asia, or Bahrain.

856
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:27,890
But now no longer
because now they have--

857
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:30,270
they use our mobile
phones to say--

858
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:31,500
they track us.

859
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:35,340
They know that we're in Spain,
or France, or Asia, or Bahrain.

860
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:39,400
That's part of the reason we
don't need to call any longer,

861
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,720
but that's part of their
fraud detection programs.

862
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,710
Let me keep moving on if I can.

863
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:48,630
So there's a series
of pain points.

864
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:51,990
And I don't necessarily have all
of them, but these are also--

865
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:55,270
you can think of them
as opportunities.

866
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:58,350
These are opportunities
for disruptors to say,

867
00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:01,230
maybe we can provide
a better service.

868
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:06,480
Maybe we can provide
something at a lower

869
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,370
cost and more inclusive.

870
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:16,090
These are the possibilities
for any startup in a sense.

871
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:19,810
So I talked a little
about the cost.

872
00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:23,790
This is a couple of years ago,
but this Bloomberg article

873
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:27,970
broke down the cost, and
I find it very helpful.

874
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:30,250
Often in the US and
in Europe, we think,

875
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:33,880
all right, I pay
$100 for something.

876
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,710
You think you paid $100 for it.

877
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:39,850
Well, actually you paid
$97 roughly for it,

878
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:43,660
and $2.75 went to
the payment system.

879
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:47,350
And that $2.75 that went to
the payment system, most of it

880
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:49,670
goes to what's called
the issuing bank.

881
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:54,100
And again, the issuing
bank is the purchaser.

882
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:57,390
The acquiring bank
is the merchant.

883
00:44:57,390 --> 00:45:01,970
So that merchant bank is
only getting $0.19 on average

884
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:06,880
two years ago, the acquiring
bank, Bank of America,

885
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,550
or whomever issued
the credit card.

886
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:12,100
So the dominant part
of the economics

887
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,660
here is on the credit card side.

888
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:19,090
There's seven big companies
in America being the big four

889
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:23,140
banks of Bank of America,
and Wells Fargo, and Citi,

890
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:25,180
and Chase.

891
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:29,140
But then Cap One is a
very big credit card bank.

892
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:32,140
And then, of course,
American Express and Discover

893
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:33,670
and the like.

894
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:37,210
Those seven big banks are
the big issuing banks.

895
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:42,670
But community banks, even
smaller banks across the land,

896
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:47,440
will issue credit cards,
and they get that roughly $2

897
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,542
out of $100 purchase.

898
00:45:50,542 --> 00:45:51,750
Now, what do they do with it?

899
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:54,680
Part of it is the
rewards program.

900
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:58,670
And wrapped up inside of all
this is an incentive system

901
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:04,430
that issuing banks are using
part of that $2.20 on average,

902
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:07,160
on average about $1--

903
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:10,490
I think the national
average recently was $1.06.

904
00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:13,550
If you take all the
different rewards programs,

905
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:15,430
they come back.

906
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:17,510
So you buy something for $100.

907
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:21,120
$2.20 goes to your issuing bank.

908
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:25,370
$1 might come back
to you as a reward.

909
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:27,940
And it makes behavioral
sciences important

910
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:30,010
and makes this stuff sticky.

911
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:35,540
It makes us loyal to our cards
in a way that pure economics,

912
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:37,510
you would think, that
it would be easier

913
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:39,460
to disrupt this space.

914
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:42,120
So I wouldn't put aside some
of these reward programs

915
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,870
when you're thinking
about, all right, I'm

916
00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:44,920
going to be a disrupter.

917
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,860
I'm going to break
into the payment space.

918
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:52,640
The credit card companies, they
have a point of view on this,

919
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:53,140
too.

920
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:56,770
And they're going to want to
protect their market share.

921
00:46:56,770 --> 00:46:58,635
Questions, Romain?

922
00:46:58,635 --> 00:46:59,260
Anything there?

923
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:00,882
ROMAIN: Let's give
it a few seconds

924
00:47:00,882 --> 00:47:02,840
just in case someone
wants to raise their hand.

925
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:05,940
Yeah.

926
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:06,230
GARY GENSLER: I'm going to--

927
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:07,500
ROMAIN: We have Luno.

928
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,770
Luno has a question.

929
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:09,950
GARY GENSLER: Sure.

930
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:12,935
And then I'm going to do
an overview of the cost.

931
00:47:12,935 --> 00:47:13,435
Luno?

932
00:47:13,435 --> 00:47:15,980
AUDIENCE: It's actually
not a question.

933
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:19,010
It's just in Europe,
it's a bit different.

934
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:21,950
The interchange fee
is actually capped

935
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:27,290
to 0.3% if it's a credit card
and 0.2% if it's a debit card.

936
00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:29,520
I'm not sure about the numbers.

937
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,480
And so I think this has
interesting spillovers in terms

938
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:36,170
of rewards programs in
Europe are definitely not

939
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:37,880
as good as in the US.

940
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:40,420
And then you can also
see that the credit card

941
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:43,550
usage is much smaller.

942
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:45,510
And that might be one
of the reasons why.

943
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:46,218
GARY GENSLER: No.

944
00:47:46,218 --> 00:47:50,470
It's a very good point
because around the globe,

945
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:54,010
the official sector inserts
them self from time to time.

946
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:58,600
And because of the
natural network effects--

947
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,640
remember that chart--
right in the middle,

948
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,860
there's powerful,
powerful economics

949
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:04,620
around network effects.

950
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:05,800
Think of plumbing again.

951
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,350
We only have one--

952
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:10,630
we usually only have
one electric company,

953
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:13,870
one waterworks company
per city because

954
00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:16,630
of that incredible network
effect of the plumbing.

955
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:18,350
Similar here.

956
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:20,440
And so what some official
sectors have said

957
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:24,460
is, so now we have to put a
limit on what can be charged.

958
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:26,770
In the US we did do that.

959
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:31,700
Senator-- did I say Levin?

960
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,100
It was Senator Durbin
actually of Illinois.

961
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:35,120
I'm sorry.

962
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:38,990
But Senator Durbin, the
Durbin Amendment, we

963
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:40,460
did that in debit cards.

964
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:43,520
But credit cards, not the case.

965
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,140
And then in other
countries, like

966
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:49,880
in Asia, which really Alipay
and WeChat Pay and others

967
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:50,720
leapfrogged.

968
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,520
And then the official sector
is involved in a different way.

969
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,250
So you're absolutely right.

970
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:57,380
So rewards programs
would be lower.

971
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:59,930
Credit card users
might be lower.

972
00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:02,210
If you're going to be
starting something,

973
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:05,480
you have to think of those
separate dynamics country

974
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:08,450
by country, very much so.

975
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:13,250
The worldwide-- an
interesting report, and this

976
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:18,410
is from a McKinsey report
from September of last year.

977
00:49:18,410 --> 00:49:23,570
McKinsey puts out an
annual report of payments.

978
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:25,190
If you're interested
in the area,

979
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:26,540
I didn't assign it as a reading.

980
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:29,420
It's a remarkable
report once a year.

981
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:32,780
But this is one chart that
I pulled from this McKinsey

982
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:33,740
report.

983
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:36,950
The worldwide revenues
in the payment system

984
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:41,825
add up to about $1.8
trillion, $1.9 trillion.

985
00:49:41,825 --> 00:49:46,130
Now, I should caution,
McKinsey includes what they

986
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:49,040
call account-related liquidity.

987
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:53,270
And this quote,
"account-related liquidity,"

988
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:59,010
is earning interest for the
banks on your credit card

989
00:49:59,010 --> 00:50:00,300
balances.

990
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:04,020
Earlier World Bank statistics
would say the payment system

991
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:06,300
around the globe takes
about a 1/2 a percent

992
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,280
to 1% of the economy.

993
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:11,310
The worldwide economy
before the corona crisis

994
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:13,620
was hovering just
short of $100 trillion,

995
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:16,770
the US economy
about $22 trillion,

996
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:20,260
the world economy
about $95 trillion.

997
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:24,750
But of that $95 trillion,
we've probably been spending,

998
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:30,370
McKinsey would say, nearly
2% on our payment system.

999
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:31,830
World Bank would say this--

1000
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:34,930
the figure is more like a
quarter to a half of that

1001
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:38,410
because McKinsey includes
all the interest that we're

1002
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:40,250
paying on our balances.

1003
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:42,140
So this is the opportunity.

1004
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:43,270
This is the opportunity.

1005
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:46,600
If you're saying, aha, what did
Stripe, what did TransferWise,

1006
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,910
what did Plaid see?

1007
00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:53,170
This is anywhere from a half a
trillion dollars at the low end

1008
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:56,190
to $2 trillion at the high end.

1009
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:59,530
1/2% to 2% of the
world economy relates

1010
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:04,240
to just moving these digital
payments back and forth

1011
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:07,030
plus the
account-related activity

1012
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:10,630
liquidity, the
starting, the lending

1013
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:13,440
balances on top of that.

1014
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,610
Romain, I see the
chat room seems

1015
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:17,940
to be lighting up quite a bit.

1016
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:20,215
Are there questions
there, or do I keep going?

1017
00:51:20,215 --> 00:51:21,340
ROMAIN: You can keep going.

1018
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:24,100
It's mainly students sharing
additional resources.

1019
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:26,230
GARY GENSLER: All right, great.

1020
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:28,460
So I was asked earlier--

1021
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:32,320
I'm sorry, I can't
remember now who asked it.

1022
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,160
Was it Carlos?

1023
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:37,690
But I apologize-- about
real-time gross settlements.

1024
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:41,890
Real-time gross settlements
is this conceptual framework

1025
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:44,400
that we are all familiar
with in one way or the other.

1026
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:53,180
Can I move a digital
instruction to move money

1027
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:58,400
and to have the settlement
be relatively fast,

1028
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,730
real-time gross settlement?

1029
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:03,090
What's the word "gross" mean?

1030
00:52:03,090 --> 00:52:05,750
It means that we're
not net settling.

1031
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:09,290
If you run a settlement system
with millions of checks coming

1032
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:13,670
into a warehouse-- and that's
literally how the system

1033
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:18,080
of check clearing used to
work in New York and elsewhere

1034
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,840
in this country--

1035
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,650
you can actually net settle.

1036
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:25,940
You can say, well, there's
these checks coming in

1037
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:29,540
from Bank of America to
Wells Fargo and these checks

1038
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:31,640
from Wells Fargo
to Bank of America.

1039
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:35,690
Let's net these settlements
off against each other.

1040
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:37,700
But if you do
something in real-time,

1041
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:39,680
if you do it almost
instantaneous,

1042
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:40,670
it has to be gross.

1043
00:52:40,670 --> 00:52:43,310
You can't net the
payment instructions

1044
00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:45,470
between the various banks.

1045
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:49,430
Real-time gross settlement is
used for large value payments

1046
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:51,080
and has been used
for large value

1047
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,780
payments for quite some time.

1048
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:58,700
In fact, the early large value
model is the Fedwire, 1970.

1049
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:01,820
That's 50 years of
technology that we've

1050
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:04,580
had the Fedwire,
meaning I can do

1051
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:06,760
what's called a
wire instruction.

1052
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,950
But in the United
Kingdom, we had CHAPS.

1053
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:13,700
And in China--

1054
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:19,700
I'm going to mispronounce
it, but C-N-A-P-S high-value

1055
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:22,250
payment system, the
Eurozone TARGET.

1056
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:26,300
2002 is actually when
the Eurozone was created.

1057
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:29,120
So we've had large value models.

1058
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:31,730
Coupled with that is
something called SWIFT.

1059
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:34,400
SWIFT is just a
messaging company.

1060
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:38,210
SWIFT, the Society for
Worldwide Interbank Financial

1061
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:41,630
Telecommunications,
I think, it's

1062
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:46,730
basically to send messages to
facilitate these interbank.

1063
00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:49,310
The question in the
last 10 to 15 years

1064
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:53,045
is, can we move from
large value to just

1065
00:53:53,045 --> 00:53:58,640
you and me, in essence, what we
think we're doing with Venmo?

1066
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:03,320
Can I move you money
rapidly instantaneously?

1067
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,975
And some countries have
actually moved forward.

1068
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:11,010
It's called real-time retail.

1069
00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:14,450
And the important thing is
it's retail instant payments.

1070
00:54:14,450 --> 00:54:18,610
Now, a lot of people don't call
it real-time retail instant.

1071
00:54:18,610 --> 00:54:21,150
A lot of people would just
call it 24 hours a day,

1072
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:25,430
7 days a week, or some
people might call it RTGS.

1073
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:27,740
But fundamentally, the
question is, can we

1074
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:34,660
do what the Fed the Reserve
of the US did 50 years ago

1075
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:39,040
and the United Kingdom
did nearly 40 years ago?

1076
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,900
Can we do that for
the retail public,

1077
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:44,530
and can we do it 24
hours a day, 7 days

1078
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:46,940
a week, every day of the year?

1079
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:49,720
And the answer is yes,
the technology exists.

1080
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:52,450
I'm listing here seven
or eight countries

1081
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:56,110
that either have
instantaneous payment

1082
00:54:56,110 --> 00:54:59,000
systems or near instantaneous.

1083
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,840
Some of these are not
literally instantaneous.

1084
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:05,960
A couple of them are
three cycles a day

1085
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:08,500
where they do this
three times a day.

1086
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,600
And I can't remember
each country,

1087
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:13,420
but you can see it's
relatively recent.

1088
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:15,290
And then the US.

1089
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:19,210
With the US projects, we
have this split system.

1090
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:24,340
The clearing house is owned
by 24 major banks in the US,

1091
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:28,380
and it's been around
since the 1850s.

1092
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:31,300
The clearing house
by 2017 said, we

1093
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:34,750
want to provide a
real-time payment network.

1094
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:38,560
But it's really buying
amongst these 24 major banks,

1095
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:41,560
all the big banks in the US.

1096
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:46,270
The Federal Reserve at first
seemed comfortable with that.

1097
00:55:46,270 --> 00:55:49,690
And then frankly, the rest
of the banking community,

1098
00:55:49,690 --> 00:55:54,740
the banks that weren't the
top 24 said, no, not really.

1099
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:56,170
And they went to Congress.

1100
00:55:56,170 --> 00:56:00,190
They went to the US Congress,
and many members of Congress

1101
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:03,490
got involved on behalf
of community banks.

1102
00:56:03,490 --> 00:56:05,440
There's 5,000 or
6,000 banks that

1103
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,800
are not direct members
of the clearinghouse.

1104
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:13,570
And so now the Federal Reserve
is standing up FedNow service.

1105
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:16,070
And you can see this in
Lael Brainard's speech.

1106
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:19,830
Now, FedNow service
is also meant

1107
00:56:19,830 --> 00:56:22,560
to be like a public
utility rather than

1108
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:25,050
controlled by these 24 banks.

1109
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:27,810
And so there's some interesting
dynamics back and forth

1110
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:29,140
in the competition.

1111
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:31,860
The clearinghouse real-time
payment network probably

1112
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:36,420
will up its game, and FedNow
will come along as well.

1113
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:39,420
Some said that the announcement
last year by the Federal

1114
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:41,970
Reserve was in reaction
to Facebook Libra,

1115
00:56:41,970 --> 00:56:45,120
and maybe that spurred
this a little bit,

1116
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,590
that the official
sector was then

1117
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:49,560
competing with Facebook
because the announcement came

1118
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:51,150
just weeks after.

1119
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:54,480
Now, I would imagine the Federal
Reserve was working on it

1120
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,310
a long time beforehand.

1121
00:56:56,310 --> 00:56:58,270
And we'll close out
this lecture today

1122
00:56:58,270 --> 00:57:03,780
on when China's digital currency
electronic payments program.

1123
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:06,120
China and the Federal
Reserve in the US

1124
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:10,350
both had major announcements
right after Facebook Libra.

1125
00:57:10,350 --> 00:57:14,940
This project, FedNow, and
China's, both had been--

1126
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:18,330
work had been done, but it
feels like the announcements

1127
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:22,140
were accelerated and
in reaction a bit.

1128
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:25,290
We don't know for
sure, of course.

1129
00:57:25,290 --> 00:57:27,486
Questions, Romain?

1130
00:57:27,486 --> 00:57:28,885
ROMAIN: None so far, Gary.

1131
00:57:28,885 --> 00:57:30,040
GARY GENSLER: All right.

1132
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:31,810
So what's the payment landscape?

1133
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:33,010
Who are the companies?

1134
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:34,690
Well, we've talked
about Big Tech.

1135
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:38,670
And I'm glad, Luke,
I think I have

1136
00:57:38,670 --> 00:57:41,920
KakaoPay on there thankfully.

1137
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,320
I should have had
LINE Pay as well.

1138
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:48,490
But Big Tech, OK, we've chatted
a little bit about that.

1139
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:52,920
And then there's, of course,
a bunch of unicorn startups.

1140
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,560
I could have put another
half dozen to a dozen,

1141
00:57:55,560 --> 00:58:00,250
unicorn being $1 billion
of value or more.

1142
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:03,490
But each of these startups
have a little bit different way

1143
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:06,220
that they've broken
into this space.

1144
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:10,280
Plaid, which we've chatted
a little bit about,

1145
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:14,860
Plaid is in this space because
they came in through open APIs

1146
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:18,670
and facilitating the
software in the system.

1147
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:23,360
Ripple is a cryptocurrency
type company.

1148
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:25,900
One97 is in India.

1149
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:28,540
It's really-- I could even
have put that in the Big Tech

1150
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:31,210
because they started,
I think, Paytm.

1151
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:35,850
NewBank addressed it a little
bit from being a challenger

1152
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:37,800
bank, and we're going
to be talking about that

1153
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:38,800
in a couple of lectures.

1154
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:42,370
Toast picks a sector,
and they really

1155
00:58:42,370 --> 00:58:45,540
dominate the restaurant sector.

1156
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:48,280
But they initially were
getting into payments

1157
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:49,660
because they were into tablets.

1158
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:53,890
So each has a bit of
a different story.

1159
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:56,650
Brex was about startups
and facilitating

1160
00:58:56,650 --> 00:58:57,820
credit for startups.

1161
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:02,300
TransferWise was cross-border,
as we talked about earlier.

1162
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:06,040
So they each found a
strategy to build themselves

1163
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,560
into this place.

1164
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:12,160
But let's just talk about Alipay
and WeChat Pay for a moment.

1165
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:15,070
This is even dated because
this is nearly a year old,

1166
00:59:15,070 --> 00:59:19,060
but this is their user base
in the last seven years,

1167
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:23,200
this remarkable growth
of usage between Alipay

1168
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:27,400
and WeChat Pay in China,
both with approximately

1169
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:28,990
a billion users.

1170
00:59:28,990 --> 00:59:31,180
It's thought that WeChat
Pay and Alipay now

1171
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:37,310
have 92% of the retail
payment space in China.

1172
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:41,390
And one of their
strategic approaches

1173
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:46,100
is that if you have a store
of value on an Alipay wallet

1174
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:50,870
and you move it to somebody
else within the Alipay system,

1175
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:53,240
as I understand it,
it's still 0 cost.

1176
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:57,980
If you jump out of service,
out of system, 10 basis points.

1177
00:59:57,980 --> 01:00:01,580
But this conceptual framework--
and their pricing model

1178
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:04,700
could change at any time,
but their pricing model

1179
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:08,300
has been historically, if you
stay within the Alipay wallet

1180
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:12,690
system, heck of a
benefit in cost.

1181
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:16,570
So merchants then start to
want to pay their vendors.

1182
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:20,620
And merchants and customers
want to stay within those wallet

1183
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:23,920
systems to keep
those costs down,

1184
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,560
significant network effects.

1185
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:27,345
Romain?

1186
01:00:27,345 --> 01:00:29,840
ROMAIN: Sijin has her hand up.

1187
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:30,855
GARY GENSLER: Please.

1188
01:00:30,855 --> 01:00:31,770
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1189
01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:32,620
Hi.

1190
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:34,750
Just want to add one point.

1191
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:38,120
I think the social platform
base is really important,

1192
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:41,530
but another thing that
Alipay is so successful

1193
01:00:41,530 --> 01:00:44,260
because it's working
closely with the government.

1194
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:50,170
For example, right now in China,
we can use a QR code in Alipay

1195
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:53,910
when we try to get
on the shuttle bus

1196
01:00:53,910 --> 01:00:55,990
or we want to get a phone.

1197
01:00:55,990 --> 01:00:58,690
We can use the Alipay
to pay that bill.

1198
01:00:58,690 --> 01:01:02,470
So actually, the government is
encouraging all of the citizens

1199
01:01:02,470 --> 01:01:05,758
to use this Alipay
and WeChat Pay.

1200
01:01:05,758 --> 01:01:06,550
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

1201
01:01:06,550 --> 01:01:09,730
So there's incredible
collaboration,

1202
01:01:09,730 --> 01:01:13,450
what you're talking
about, between government

1203
01:01:13,450 --> 01:01:16,060
and these payments systems.

1204
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:18,140
And we've seen this
in India as well.

1205
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:21,040
India really
encouraged the uptake.

1206
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:24,700
And I could have put various
statistics in for India.

1207
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:26,590
They're a couple or
few years behind.

1208
01:01:26,590 --> 01:01:31,450
They're not as robust
and developed in India.

1209
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:36,010
But this encouragement by the
official sector or the banking

1210
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:36,670
sector--

1211
01:01:36,670 --> 01:01:39,880
sometimes in other countries,
it can be by the banking sector.

1212
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:43,330
But what's interesting in China,
and we'll close out on this,

1213
01:01:43,330 --> 01:01:47,300
is now the Chinese
government is offering

1214
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:50,770
what one might say is a
complement or a competitor

1215
01:01:50,770 --> 01:01:54,730
to WeChat and Alipay through
the Chinese digital currency

1216
01:01:54,730 --> 01:01:57,700
electronic payment
project or DCEP.

1217
01:01:57,700 --> 01:02:02,230
And so they've facilitated the
ramp up of Alipay and WeChat

1218
01:02:02,230 --> 01:02:07,280
Pay, but now they're going to
have an alternative as well.

1219
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:08,500
So it's very interesting.

1220
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:11,230
And I think in part,
this is to facilitate

1221
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:14,560
the commercial banks were
losing a significant market

1222
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:18,070
share to Alipay and WeChat Pay,
that the Chinese government

1223
01:02:18,070 --> 01:02:22,450
may well have been encouraged
to build their own--

1224
01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:24,850
they call it the central
bank digital currency--

1225
01:02:24,850 --> 01:02:29,110
but their own wallet
system, digital wallet,

1226
01:02:29,110 --> 01:02:36,250
digital yuan that will look
a lot like Alipay and WeChat

1227
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:37,060
wallets.

1228
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:40,750
And in fact, this is all
being rolled out in 2020.

1229
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:44,560
But in fact, the
initial pronouncements

1230
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:48,370
say that it must be
accepted, so just

1231
01:02:48,370 --> 01:02:51,970
as we have had multiple
centuries of laws that

1232
01:02:51,970 --> 01:02:53,800
are called legal tender laws.

1233
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:56,590
And the legal tender
laws go all the way

1234
01:02:56,590 --> 01:03:00,040
back to Genghis
Khan in China, where

1235
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:03,350
under the coercive
power of the state,

1236
01:03:03,350 --> 01:03:07,060
you must accept in those
days the paper bark

1237
01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:10,060
currency of Genghis
Khan, or in the US,

1238
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:13,070
you must accept the US
dollar for all debts

1239
01:03:13,070 --> 01:03:14,440
public and private.

1240
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:16,360
Those are called
legal tender laws.

1241
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:18,970
Something similar is
happening right now in China

1242
01:03:18,970 --> 01:03:22,480
that this DCEP will
have to be accepted,

1243
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,050
at first in certain cities.

1244
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:26,878
They're going to start,
I think, in two cities,

1245
01:03:26,878 --> 01:03:28,420
and then they're
going to roll it out

1246
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:31,880
over time in other places.

1247
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:34,270
So now let's look
here in the US.

1248
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:36,670
And I picked
Facebook because they

1249
01:03:36,670 --> 01:03:38,710
haven't been as successful.

1250
01:03:38,710 --> 01:03:44,770
This remarkable platform,
Facebook is so ubiquitous,

1251
01:03:44,770 --> 01:03:47,470
over 2 billion members
around the globe.

1252
01:03:47,470 --> 01:03:50,130
They've tried multiple
times to get into payments

1253
01:03:50,130 --> 01:03:52,630
starting 11 years ago.

1254
01:03:52,630 --> 01:03:54,850
Virtual currency
in 15 currencies

1255
01:03:54,850 --> 01:03:58,330
terminated in four
years, Facebook credit.

1256
01:03:58,330 --> 01:04:02,290
They came about in 2015
Facebook Messenger.

1257
01:04:02,290 --> 01:04:04,780
They started in the
US, UK, and France.

1258
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:09,230
By 2019, they rolled out
of France and the UK.

1259
01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:13,400
They, in India, had a pilot
that for the longest time

1260
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:19,700
was in pilot
purgatory, in a sense.

1261
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:21,560
Facebook could not
get the approval

1262
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:24,500
of the Indian government to go
beyond one million accounts.

1263
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:30,050
They only recently in the early
spring of 2020, late winter,

1264
01:04:30,050 --> 01:04:32,780
got approval that they
could move up to 10 million

1265
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:34,380
and so forth.

1266
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:39,170
But it's pending further
data standardization,

1267
01:04:39,170 --> 01:04:42,680
and it's conditional on
data standardization.

1268
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:45,740
And then last November,
they announced Facebook Pay.

1269
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:48,170
Now, that puts aside
Facebook Libra.

1270
01:04:48,170 --> 01:04:51,740
I'm just saying their
efforts to do Facebook Pay,

1271
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:54,080
bringing together
Facebook Messenger,

1272
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:59,080
Instagram, WhatsApp
is their new effort.

1273
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:01,520
You can decide whether you
think they'll be successful.

1274
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:04,300
But it's interesting that
in some circumstances,

1275
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:06,940
Facebook has been very
successful, but not so much

1276
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:08,140
in the payment space.

1277
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:13,180
And even Google Wallet and
Google Pay has more adoption,

1278
01:05:13,180 --> 01:05:17,140
and Apple Pay has more adoption
than we've seen in Facebook,

1279
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:18,560
as I understand it.

1280
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:21,560
It's hard to get
all the statistics.

1281
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:25,540
So it gives you a little bit
of a sense of these challenges.

1282
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:27,490
What's the landscape?

1283
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:29,720
Going to do it a little
quickly, but this

1284
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:30,970
is to give you that landscape.

1285
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:34,660
First, commercial banks and
the bank-owned networks.

1286
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:36,970
I put here thousands of banks.

1287
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:38,770
They've been around since 1784.

1288
01:05:38,770 --> 01:05:40,660
I like taking 1784
because that's

1289
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:44,890
the Bank of New York here in the
US, Alexander Hamilton's bank.

1290
01:05:44,890 --> 01:05:47,290
But the clearinghouse
literally has been around

1291
01:05:47,290 --> 01:05:48,820
since the 1850s.

1292
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:51,880
It was a place where people
took physical checks,

1293
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:53,860
negotiable orders
of withdraw, and had

1294
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:57,290
to take them into a
warehouse and clear them.

1295
01:05:57,290 --> 01:05:59,860
But even UnionPay
in China, which

1296
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:03,010
was formed amongst
85 banks initially--

1297
01:06:03,010 --> 01:06:05,710
and some say maybe the
People's Bank of China

1298
01:06:05,710 --> 01:06:09,460
owns something of it, too--
but UnionPay, these bank

1299
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:12,120
consortium.

1300
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:15,990
Next in this architecture
of the payment landscape,

1301
01:06:15,990 --> 01:06:17,460
the card companies.

1302
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:20,050
I would note that
Visa was a consortium.

1303
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:22,380
Bank of America was
a California bank.

1304
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:24,810
It was not a national
bank at the time.

1305
01:06:24,810 --> 01:06:28,230
And Bank of America wanted to
offer its California credit

1306
01:06:28,230 --> 01:06:31,710
card across the country
and formed a consortium.

1307
01:06:31,710 --> 01:06:34,020
It later became an
independent company.

1308
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:35,700
It later went public.

1309
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:41,320
And it's got a $373 billion
market value as of last Friday.

1310
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:45,870
Now, we sometimes talk about the
Big Tech firms, the big four,

1311
01:06:45,870 --> 01:06:49,260
Microsoft, and Google,
and Amazon, and Apple.

1312
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:51,600
They all have market
values above this.

1313
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:54,930
But Visa is one of the
10 highest market cap

1314
01:06:54,930 --> 01:06:59,470
companies in the country,
maybe in the world.

1315
01:06:59,470 --> 01:07:02,130
And then, of course, Mastercard
and so forth, Discover

1316
01:07:02,130 --> 01:07:03,000
and the Dow.

1317
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,850
So that's the base
layer, but then there's

1318
01:07:05,850 --> 01:07:08,490
something that you and I
don't think a lot about,

1319
01:07:08,490 --> 01:07:11,040
is payments service providers.

1320
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:14,760
And these companies have gone
through a significant wave

1321
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:16,170
of consolidation.

1322
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:18,270
These were data
companies basically,

1323
01:07:18,270 --> 01:07:20,700
expounded around 20 years ago.

1324
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:24,030
Fiserv is an agglomeration
of three or four

1325
01:07:24,030 --> 01:07:26,100
different companies
that have come together

1326
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:27,330
over the last few years.

1327
01:07:27,330 --> 01:07:31,560
But these dominant
companies here in the US

1328
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:34,500
are the backbones of
the payment network

1329
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:37,110
right in the middle of
that earlier chart that we

1330
01:07:37,110 --> 01:07:41,760
talked about, $45 billion to
$80 billion market value each.

1331
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:48,170
And now we get to the
startups starting with PayPal

1332
01:07:48,170 --> 01:07:53,740
at $124 billion of value, and
Square, and then some companies

1333
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:55,960
you might not be
as familiar with.

1334
01:07:55,960 --> 01:08:00,380
But each one of these companies
founded usually in the 20-year

1335
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:00,880
timeframe--

1336
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:03,100
I'll put Western
Union to the side.

1337
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:08,620
Western Union was that company
that started in the 1850s.

1338
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:12,590
These are publicly
traded companies.

1339
01:08:12,590 --> 01:08:14,040
You can look at
their financials.

1340
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:17,500
If you were actually going to
go and compete in this space,

1341
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:20,080
I'd largely recommend you've
got to pull these financials,

1342
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:23,950
read their public statements,
see how they make their money.

1343
01:08:23,950 --> 01:08:26,319
But then there's the
private companies.

1344
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:28,850
And all I could do to
value these companies that

1345
01:08:28,850 --> 01:08:32,649
go to Forbes and Crunchbase
and some other sources to say,

1346
01:08:32,649 --> 01:08:35,439
what was their
last funding round?

1347
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:38,069
Stripe has not gone public yet.

1348
01:08:38,069 --> 01:08:41,439
Paytm in India has
not gone public yet,

1349
01:08:41,439 --> 01:08:43,210
but these are their
last funding rounds.

1350
01:08:43,210 --> 01:08:49,880
Plaid was purchased for
$5.3 billion by Visa.

1351
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:53,120
But it gives you that
sense, putting aside

1352
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:55,790
whether these values
will persist or not.

1353
01:08:55,790 --> 01:08:58,520
And there's hundreds,
thousands of other companies

1354
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:02,420
in this space competing.

1355
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:05,479
As I said, there's a
lot of consolidation.

1356
01:09:05,479 --> 01:09:08,960
And one of the consolidations
is around payment service

1357
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:09,830
providers.

1358
01:09:09,830 --> 01:09:13,310
Just in the last 18
months, four big mergers,

1359
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:16,819
one in Europe, three
in the US, basically

1360
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:21,170
consolidation in the
middle of this technology.

1361
01:09:21,170 --> 01:09:24,380
First Data, which was one of
the biggest companies, that

1362
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:27,830
basically was on
the merchant side,

1363
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:29,840
helping merchants with
their point of sale,

1364
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:34,240
Worldpay that does this annual
report that I talked about,

1365
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:38,479
and Total Systems Services all
bought in the last 15 months.

1366
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:43,160
And then in Europe, Worldline
bought Ingenico, which

1367
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:46,370
was like a cross-Europe merger.

1368
01:09:46,370 --> 01:09:47,810
But we're seeing
a lot of mergers

1369
01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:50,359
also in the data
aggregator side.

1370
01:09:50,359 --> 01:09:52,130
Visa bought Plaid,
as we talked about.

1371
01:09:52,130 --> 01:09:56,300
And SoFi recently announced for
over $1 billion buying Galileo.

1372
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:59,350
Galileo is a smaller
competitor of Plaid

1373
01:09:59,350 --> 01:10:02,890
that is in this API
data aggregators

1374
01:10:02,890 --> 01:10:06,200
space, a really important
space in payments.

1375
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:09,890
SoFi, which we'll talk about
in our next couple of classes,

1376
01:10:09,890 --> 01:10:15,810
started as a credit provider,
not in the payment side.

1377
01:10:15,810 --> 01:10:19,100
But here it's interesting that
SoFi is going back and saying,

1378
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:20,930
we want to get to
that payment side.

1379
01:10:20,930 --> 01:10:26,620
We want to acquire
Galileo and the API side.

1380
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:30,160
And so a little talk, and we've
only got a few minutes left.

1381
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:32,420
We already talked
about crypto projects,

1382
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:35,140
but the crypto land is here.

1383
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:39,910
And they're saying
maybe a digital token

1384
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:42,710
backed by US dollars
or backed by Euro

1385
01:10:42,710 --> 01:10:47,170
or yen would be the way to
address these pain points.

1386
01:10:47,170 --> 01:10:49,240
Some are retail projects.

1387
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:51,760
Mostly tether and others
on the retail side

1388
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:54,280
are about cryptocurrency
exchanges.

1389
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:56,740
But the wholesale
projects are interesting.

1390
01:10:56,740 --> 01:10:59,080
14 large banks
have come together

1391
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:01,390
and formed this
thing called Fnality

1392
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:04,420
without an I. It's F-nality.

1393
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:07,300
JP Morgan has said
JP Morgan Coin.

1394
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:13,550
These are trying to use digital
tokens representing Fiat money

1395
01:11:13,550 --> 01:11:15,620
to smooth out pain points.

1396
01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:17,900
And then the messaging
companies, Telegram,

1397
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:22,160
the world's largest secure or
encrypted messaging company

1398
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:25,670
with 400 million
members or customers,

1399
01:11:25,670 --> 01:11:28,490
they're trying to have a token
called GRAM, even though it's

1400
01:11:28,490 --> 01:11:30,650
held up in the
securities law case

1401
01:11:30,650 --> 01:11:32,690
that they have with the
Securities and Exchange

1402
01:11:32,690 --> 01:11:34,910
Commission here in the US.

1403
01:11:34,910 --> 01:11:36,420
And that sets the stage--

1404
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:38,200
I'm going to skip over--

1405
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:42,230
that Bitcoin and all of these
payment tokens are out there

1406
01:11:42,230 --> 01:11:44,360
and talk about the goals
they're trying to do.

1407
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:47,810
The goals they are trying
to do are the same things--

1408
01:11:47,810 --> 01:11:50,240
addressing pain points,
extending settlement

1409
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:54,890
to 24 hours a day, 7 days
a week, and lowering costs.

1410
01:11:54,890 --> 01:11:59,000
That's why JP Morgan
has JP Morgan Coin.

1411
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,100
It might be a
little bit of hype,

1412
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:02,930
but there's some
reality, too, that they

1413
01:12:02,930 --> 01:12:07,250
think that between their project
and this competitive project

1414
01:12:07,250 --> 01:12:09,620
Fnality at the
wholesale payment space,

1415
01:12:09,620 --> 01:12:14,270
they can lower cost in
the cross-border space.

1416
01:12:14,270 --> 01:12:17,390
So Facebook comes along, and
Facebook says, well, maybe we

1417
01:12:17,390 --> 01:12:18,830
can do it.

1418
01:12:18,830 --> 01:12:22,040
Maybe we can do it with
a worldwide currency.

1419
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:24,000
They announced it was--

1420
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,715
it didn't lack ambition.

1421
01:12:25,715 --> 01:12:30,860
Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook
announced a new global currency

1422
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:33,080
to meet the needs of
billions of people.

1423
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:35,270
They talked about
financial inclusion.

1424
01:12:35,270 --> 01:12:37,910
They talked about
cross-border pain points.

1425
01:12:37,910 --> 01:12:41,240
And they said, this is
the wave of the future.

1426
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:45,360
It's run into a lot of central
bank concerns around the globe.

1427
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:48,590
It's run into
significant public sector

1428
01:12:48,590 --> 01:12:50,760
concerns around the globe.

1429
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:53,900
It's still uncertain
whether it will take off,

1430
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:56,930
but it's a significant
feature of this payment space

1431
01:12:56,930 --> 01:13:00,290
that one needs to
understand, even if it's just

1432
01:13:00,290 --> 01:13:02,060
a catalyst for change.

1433
01:13:02,060 --> 01:13:06,500
Both China and the US reacted
quickly with the FedNow project

1434
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:10,490
here in the US and the
central bank digital currency

1435
01:13:10,490 --> 01:13:12,740
project in China.

1436
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:15,050
So I'm going to close on
just a little chart that

1437
01:13:15,050 --> 01:13:18,005
shows Libra versus central
bank digital currency

1438
01:13:18,005 --> 01:13:21,230
and just say something
about China's project.

1439
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:25,310
China's project, not yet
lived, digital currency

1440
01:13:25,310 --> 01:13:28,910
electronic payment
program, the issuer

1441
01:13:28,910 --> 01:13:30,650
is the People's Bank of China.

1442
01:13:30,650 --> 01:13:33,800
And this is a really
important question that

1443
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:36,410
is on a lot of people's mind.

1444
01:13:36,410 --> 01:13:40,520
If a central bank issues a
digital representation of money

1445
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:46,620
directly, what's the role
of the commercial banks?

1446
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:48,480
Commercial banks
in most countries

1447
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:51,300
are the issuer of digital money.

1448
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:54,480
I know we think about central
banks in the 180 countries

1449
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:57,330
that have money, and
they're really important.

1450
01:13:57,330 --> 01:14:00,360
But it's commercial banks
that keep those ledgers.

1451
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:04,080
The commercial banks with some
backing of their governments,

1452
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:07,740
either implicit or explicit
with deposit insurance,

1453
01:14:07,740 --> 01:14:11,940
you and I have a liability to
our banks, to Bank America,

1454
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:15,650
to Barclays, to
some bank in Asia.

1455
01:14:15,650 --> 01:14:17,550
The People's Bank
of China is saying,

1456
01:14:17,550 --> 01:14:20,730
no, we will issue this
directly, but we'll

1457
01:14:20,730 --> 01:14:23,880
have the commercial
banks involved.

1458
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:26,580
And the commercial banks,
you'll get your digital wallet

1459
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:27,780
from the commercial banks.

1460
01:14:27,780 --> 01:14:31,050
There were announcements
as of early April 2020

1461
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:36,330
that update us, but we don't
yet have the full picture.

1462
01:14:36,330 --> 01:14:40,020
It looks like it's basically a
centralized private network run

1463
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:41,670
by the PBOC.

1464
01:14:41,670 --> 01:14:44,550
It does look like
Alipay and WeChat Pay

1465
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:46,840
will have to use this system.

1466
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:50,730
So some question is, how
different will it really be?

1467
01:14:50,730 --> 01:14:56,070
It looks like by government Fiat
rolled out by city and region

1468
01:14:56,070 --> 01:14:59,250
that merchants will
have to accept DCEP.

1469
01:14:59,250 --> 01:15:01,620
So the QR system
on those buses will

1470
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:06,240
have to have DCEP,
Alipay, and WeChat Pay.

1471
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:08,700
Alipay has taken out
a bunch of patents

1472
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:12,210
already on how to
interface with DCEP.

1473
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:14,370
So it's a work in
progress, but it's

1474
01:15:14,370 --> 01:15:15,980
an important feature of this.

1475
01:15:15,980 --> 01:15:18,630
And if you're thinking
about payments,

1476
01:15:18,630 --> 01:15:19,710
this is really important.

1477
01:15:19,710 --> 01:15:22,440
And what's fascinating is
central banks around the globe

1478
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:25,370
are then looking to
see what China's done.

1479
01:15:25,370 --> 01:15:30,720
Sweden was already looking at an
electronic digital central bank

1480
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:33,300
currency, the E-krona.

1481
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:35,520
And they were at the forefront.

1482
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:38,190
But now you can go central
bank around central bank.

1483
01:15:38,190 --> 01:15:39,780
France has made announcements.

1484
01:15:39,780 --> 01:15:43,020
The United Kingdom has
made announcements in 2020,

1485
01:15:43,020 --> 01:15:48,180
all in this milieu of, how
do we address pain points?

1486
01:15:48,180 --> 01:15:51,390
Do we as a central bank have a
responsibility to our citizens

1487
01:15:51,390 --> 01:15:55,290
to continue to offer a digital
currency when the paper

1488
01:15:55,290 --> 01:15:57,060
currency is going away?

1489
01:15:57,060 --> 01:15:59,130
And important public
policy questions of,

1490
01:15:59,130 --> 01:16:00,090
what does this do?

1491
01:16:00,090 --> 01:16:02,950
Does it destabilize
commercial banks?

1492
01:16:02,950 --> 01:16:07,230
So I think that's
a bit of a wrap.
