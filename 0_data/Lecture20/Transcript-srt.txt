1
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:16,840
MICHALE FEE: So today, we're
going to start a new topic.

2
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,740
We're going to be talking about
the propagation of signals

3
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,610
in dendrites and axons.

4
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:27,790
So the model that
we've considered so far

5
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,430
is just a soma.

6
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:36,280
We basically had a kind of a
spherical shell of insulator

7
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,160
that we've been modeling that
has different kinds of ion

8
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,280
channels in it that allow the
cell to do things like generate

9
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,630
an action potential.

10
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:46,660
So the reason that
we've been doing

11
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,590
that is because in most
vertebrate neurons,

12
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:54,580
the soma is the sight in the
neuron at which the decision

13
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,470
to make an action
potential is made.

14
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:00,880
So all kinds of inputs
come in, and then the soma

15
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,790
integrates those inputs,
accumulates charge,

16
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:07,660
reaches some spiking
threshold, and then generates

17
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,080
an action potential.

18
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,870
And so that's where
the decision is about

19
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,250
whether a neuron is
going to spike or not.

20
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,930
Now, in real neurons,
relatively few of the inputs

21
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,490
actually come onto the soma.

22
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:23,000
Most of the synaptic
inputs, most of the inputs

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,350
arrive onto the dendrites, which
are these branching cylinders

24
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,000
of cell membrane.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,830
And most of the
synapses actually

26
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:34,240
form onto the dendrite at
some distance from the soma.

27
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,770
There are synapses that
form onto the soma.

28
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,810
But the vast
majority of synapses

29
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,180
form onto these dendrites.

30
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,220
And sometimes,
those synapses can

31
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,590
be as far away as 1 or
2 millimeters for very

32
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:49,350
large neurons in cortex.

33
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:54,960
So there's a population
of neurons in deep layer V

34
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,300
some of you may have heard
about that have dendrites

35
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,700
that reach all the
way up into layer I.

36
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,280
And those cells can be--

37
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,660
those dendrites can be as long
as a couple of millimeters.

38
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:10,259
So we really have to think
about what this means,

39
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:15,960
how signals get from out here in
the dendrite down to the soma.

40
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,890
And that's what we're
going to talk about today.

41
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,310
So the most important thing
that we're going to do

42
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:27,180
is to simplify
this-- by the way,

43
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,575
anybody know what
kind of cell this is?

44
00:02:29,575 --> 00:02:30,465
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

45
00:02:30,465 --> 00:02:31,215
MICHALE FEE: Good.

46
00:02:31,215 --> 00:02:32,920
It's a Purkinje cell.

47
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,590
And it was one of the--

48
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:39,190
this is one of the cells
that Ramon Cajal drew back

49
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:42,310
in the late 1800s.

50
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,950
So the most important
thing we're going to do

51
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:50,170
is to simplify this very
complex dendritic arborization.

52
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,630
And we're going
to basically think

53
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,830
of it as a single cylinder.

54
00:02:54,830 --> 00:03:00,070
Now mathematically, there
are reasons why this is not

55
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,550
actually unreasonable.

56
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,650
You can write down--
if you analyze

57
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,600
the structure of
dendritic trees,

58
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,120
there is something
about the way the ratio

59
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,300
of the diameters of
the different dendrites

60
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,430
as they converge to
form thicker branches

61
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,290
as you get closer
and closer to closer

62
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,500
to the soma that
mathematically makes

63
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:26,800
this not a bad approximation
for an extended dendritic arbor

64
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,430
like this.

65
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,850
So we're going to think
about the problem of having

66
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:35,170
a synapse out here on this
cylindrical approximation

67
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:35,980
to a dendrite.

68
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,500
And we're going to
imagine that we're

69
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,140
measuring the voltage
down here at the soma

70
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,260
or at different positions
along the dendrite.

71
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:49,630
And we're going to ask, how
does synaptic input out here

72
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:54,025
on this cylinder affect
the membrane potential

73
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,200
in the dendrite and
down here at the soma?

74
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,700
And the basic conceptual
picture that you should have

75
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,770
is that those signals propagate
some distance down the soma

76
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,070
but gradually leak out.

77
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:14,790
And there's a very simple kind
of intuitive picture, which

78
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:20,190
is that the dendrite you
can think of this as a leaky

79
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,540
pipe or a leaky hose.

80
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:26,070
So imagine you took a
piece of garden hose

81
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:30,660
and you poked holes
in the side of it

82
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:35,310
or so that they're
kind of close together.

83
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,810
And when you hook this
up to the water faucet,

84
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,710
you turn the water on,
that some of that water

85
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,160
flows down the hose.

86
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,410
But some of it also leaks
out through the holes

87
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:47,710
that you drilled.

88
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:50,580
And you can see that
eventually the water is all

89
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,170
going to leak out
through the sides,

90
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,630
and it's not going to go all
the way down to the other end

91
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,820
to get to your
hydrangeas or whatever

92
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,830
it is that you're watering.

93
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,620
And so you can see
that that signal isn't

94
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:06,900
going to get very far
if the holes you drilled

95
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,710
are big enough.

96
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,170
And the general
kind of analogy here

97
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:15,920
is that current is like
the flow of the water.

98
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,800
Electrical current here is
like water current flowing down

99
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,730
the pipe.

100
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,630
And voltage is like pressure.

101
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:26,270
So the higher the pressure here,
the higher the current flow

102
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:26,870
you'll get.

103
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,370
And we're going to develop
an electrical circuit

104
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,030
model for a dendrite
like this that's

105
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:41,460
going to look like a set
of resistors going down

106
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,130
the axis of the dendrite
and a set of resistors

107
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:47,050
that go across the membrane.

108
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,980
And you can see that each
little piece of membrane

109
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,810
here, a little piece
of the dendrite

110
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:56,430
is going to look like a
resistor divider, where you have

111
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:00,060
a resistor along
the axial direction

112
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,160
and a resistance
across the membrane.

113
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,880
And as you make a longer and
longer piece of dendrite,

114
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,310
you're going to get
additional voltage dividers.

115
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,730
Each voltage divider
divides the voltage

116
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:14,520
by some constant factor.

117
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,290
And as you stack
those things up,

118
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:20,610
the voltage drops by some
constant factor per unit length

119
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:21,450
of the dendrite.

120
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:22,980
And so you can
see-- anybody want

121
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:26,340
to just take a guess of
what kind of functional form

122
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,230
that would give
you if you divide

123
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,450
the voltage by some
constant factor

124
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:33,013
each unit length
of the dendrite?

125
00:06:33,013 --> 00:06:33,930
AUDIENCE: Exponential.

126
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:34,972
MICHALE FEE: Exponential.

127
00:06:34,972 --> 00:06:36,640
That's right.

128
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,270
And that's where this
exponential falloff comes from.

129
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:48,110
So today, we're going to
do the following things.

130
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,810
And we're going
to basically draw

131
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,020
a circuit diagram, an
electrical equivalent

132
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,030
circuit of a piece of dendrite.

133
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:59,510
And I would like you to be able
to make that drawing if you're

134
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,040
asked to.

135
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,650
We're going to be able
to plot the voltage

136
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,140
in a piece of dendrite
as a function of distance

137
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:10,080
for the case of a dendrite
that has leaky walls

138
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,540
and for the case of a dendrite
that has non-leaky walls.

139
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,720
And we're going to describe
the concept of a length

140
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,450
constant, which I'll tell
you right now is just

141
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:27,490
the 1 over the distance at which
the voltage falls by 1 over e

142
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:28,490
as a function of length.

143
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,580
So it's some length over
which the voltage falls

144
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,600
by some amount 1 over e.

145
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,250
We're going to go over how
that length constant depends

146
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:42,270
on the radius of the dendrite.

147
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:45,180
It's a function of the size.

148
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,370
And also, we're going
to describe the concept

149
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,290
of an electrotonic length.

150
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:50,820
And then finally,
we're going to go

151
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,880
to some sort of extreme
simplifications,

152
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,090
even beyond taking that
very complex dendrite,

153
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:59,010
simplifying it as a cylinder.

154
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,320
We're going to go to
an even simpler case

155
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:05,130
where we can just treat the
cell as a soma connected

156
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:07,620
to a resistor
connected by a resistor

157
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,350
to a separate compartment.

158
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,900
And that's sort of the
most extreme simplification

159
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,800
of a dendrite.

160
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,520
But, in fact, it's an
extremely powerful one

161
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,100
from which you can
get a lot of intuition

162
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,910
about how signals are
integrated in dendrites.

163
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:30,470
So we're going to analyze
a piece of dendrite

164
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,980
using a technique called
finite element analysis.

165
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,480
We're going to
imagine-- we're going

166
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,270
to approximate our piece
of dendrite as a cylinder

167
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:42,770
of constant radius a, an
axial dimension that we're

168
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:45,230
going to label x.

169
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:48,590
We're going to break up this
cylinder into little slices.

170
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,720
So imagine we just
took a little knife,

171
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,220
and we cut little
slices of this dendrite.

172
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,020
And they're going to
be very small slices.

173
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,290
And we're going to model
each one of those slices

174
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,153
with a separate little circuit.

175
00:09:02,153 --> 00:09:04,070
And then we're going to
connect them together.

176
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,778
And we're going to
let the length of that

177
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:07,010
slice be delta x.

178
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:10,640
And then eventually, we're
going to let delta x go to 0.

179
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,950
We're going to get some
differential equations that

180
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:15,740
describe that relationship
between the voltage

181
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,510
and the current in
this piece of dendrite.

182
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:27,290
So let's start with a model for
the inside of this cylinder.

183
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:31,540
So remember, in a
cell, we had the inside

184
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:34,720
of the cell modeled by a wire.

185
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,650
In a dendrite, we
can't just use a wire.

186
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:40,960
And the reason is that
current is going to flow along

187
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,663
the inside of the dendrite.

188
00:09:42,663 --> 00:09:44,080
It's going to flow,
and it's going

189
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,850
to experience voltage drops.

190
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:50,020
So we have to actually
model the resistance

191
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,550
of the inside of the dendrite.

192
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:56,290
And we're going to model
it like the resistance

193
00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:00,060
between each one of those slices
with a resistor value little r.

194
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:07,390
We're going to model the outside
of the axon or the dendrite

195
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,140
as a wire.

196
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,170
And the reason we're going to
put resistors inside and just

197
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:15,700
a wire outside is because the
resistance-- remember the axon

198
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,260
or dendrite is very small.

199
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:20,110
In the brain, dendrites might
be about 2 microns across.

200
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:23,410
So the current is constrained
to a very small space.

201
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:25,840
When currents then
flow outside, they're

202
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:30,280
flowing in a much larger volume,
and so the effective resistance

203
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,760
is much smaller.

204
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,270
And we're going to essentially
ignore that resistance

205
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:36,760
and treat the outside
as just a wire.

206
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,790
Now we have to
model the membrane.

207
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:46,730
Anybody want to take
a guess how we're

208
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,125
going to model the membrane?

209
00:10:50,635 --> 00:10:51,990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

210
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,500
MICHALE FEE: What's that?

211
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,470
I heard two correct answers.

212
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,830
What did you say Jasmine?

213
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:58,830
AUDIENCE: The capacitor.

214
00:10:58,830 --> 00:10:59,490
MICHALE FEE: Capacitor.

215
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,160
And?

216
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,750
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

217
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,720
MICHALE FEE: Excellent.

218
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,220
Whoops.

219
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,435
I wasn't quite there.

220
00:11:06,435 --> 00:11:07,940
Let's put that up.

221
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,440
Good.

222
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,200
So we're going to
have a capacitance.

223
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,360
We're going to imagine
that this membrane might

224
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,390
have an ion selective ion
channel with some conductance G

225
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:21,760
sub l and an equilibrium or
reversal potential E sub l.

226
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,470
Now coming back to these terms
here, we're going to model.

227
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,660
We're going to write
down the voltage

228
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,110
in each one of our little
slices of the dendrite.

229
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:33,270
So let's do that.

230
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:37,740
Let's just pick one of
them as V, the voltage,

231
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,732
at position, x, and time t.

232
00:11:41,732 --> 00:11:44,800
The voltage in the
next slides over

233
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,710
is going to be V at
x plus delta x of t.

234
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,760
And the voltage in this slice
over here is V of x minus delta

235
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,400
x and t.

236
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,450
So now, we can also write down
the current that goes axially

237
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,760
through that piece of--

238
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,140
that slice of our dendrite.

239
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:09,070
We're going to call
that I of x and t.

240
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:12,420
And we can write down also the
current in every other time--

241
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,950
in every other slice
of the dendrite, I

242
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,930
of x minus delta x and t.

243
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:25,700
And we're going to model
this piece of membrane

244
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:30,290
in each one of those
slices as well.

245
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:31,400
Any questions about that?

246
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,690
That's the basic setup.

247
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:39,400
That's the basic finite
element model of a dendrite.

248
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,450
No questions?

249
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:49,590
Now we also have to model the
current through the membrane.

250
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:54,300
That's going to be I
sub m, m for membrane.

251
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,730
And it's going to be
a current per unit

252
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:59,490
length of the dendrite.

253
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,640
We're going to imagine
that there's current

254
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,180
flowing from the inside to the
outside through the membrane.

255
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:08,180
And there's going to be
some current per unit

256
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,285
length of the dendrite.

257
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:15,630
And we can also imagine that
we have current being injected,

258
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:18,660
let's say, through a synapse
or through an electrode

259
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:22,620
that we can also model as
coming in at any position x.

260
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:28,125
And this is, again, current
per unit length times delta x.

261
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,000
Does that make sense?

262
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:39,880
So the first thing
we're going to do

263
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:48,685
is we're going to write
down the relation between V

264
00:13:48,685 --> 00:13:53,260
in each node and the current
going through that node.

265
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,710
So let's do that.

266
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,440
We're going to use Ohm's law.

267
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,130
So the voltage difference
between here and here

268
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:05,235
is just going to be the
current times that resistance.

269
00:14:05,235 --> 00:14:06,110
Does that make sense?

270
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,910
We're just going
to use Ohm's law--

271
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,990
very simple.

272
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:19,870
So V of x and t minus
V of x plus delta x, t

273
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:23,830
is just equal to little
r times that current.

274
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,560
And now we're going
to rewrite this.

275
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:34,090
Let's divide both sides of
this equation by delta x.

276
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:38,530
So you see 1 over delta x V
of x minus V of x plus delta

277
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:43,300
x is equal to little r over
delta x times the current.

278
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:48,540
And can anyone tell me what that
thing is as delta x goes to 0?

279
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,440
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

280
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,190
MICHALE FEE: Good.

281
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:53,430
It's the derivative of--
it's the spatial derivative

282
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:56,480
of the voltage.

283
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,910
That's just the
definition of derivative

284
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,650
when delta x goes to 0.

285
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,020
So let's write that out.

286
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,610
Notice that it's the
negative of the derivative

287
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:08,420
because the derivative
would have V

288
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,490
of x plus delta x minus V of x.

289
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,730
So it's a negative
of the derivative.

290
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:18,660
So negative dv/dx is
equal to some resistance

291
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,750
times the current.

292
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:23,010
And notice that
this capital R sub a

293
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:26,430
is called the axial
resistance per unit length.

294
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:33,060
It's this resistance per
unit length of the dendrite.

295
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:38,760
Now notice that if you pass
current down that dendrite,

296
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,540
the voltage drop is
going to keep increasing.

297
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,060
The resistance is going to
keep increasing the longer

298
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,710
that piece of dendrite is.

299
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,750
So you can think
about resistance

300
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,970
in a piece of dendrite
more appropriately

301
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:55,620
as resistance per unit length.

302
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,530
So there's Ohm's law--

303
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:03,060
minus dv/dx equals axial
resistance per unit length

304
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:03,810
times the current.

305
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,298
Any questions?

306
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,370
And notice that
according to this,

307
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,910
current flow to the
right, positive I

308
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,650
is defined as current
to the right here

309
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:24,650
produces a negative
gradient in the voltage.

310
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,280
So the voltage is high on this
side and low on that side.

311
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,028
So the slope is negative.

312
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,360
So now let's take
this, and let's

313
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,080
analyze this for some
simple cases where

314
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,540
we have no membrane current.

315
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,880
So we're going to
just ignore those.

316
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,380
And we're just going to include
these axial resistances.

317
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,000
And we're going to analyze
what this equation tells us

318
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,572
about the voltage
inside of the dendrite.

319
00:16:53,572 --> 00:16:56,160
Does that makes sense?

320
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,330
So let's do that.

321
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:03,290
So if we take that equation,
we can write down the current

322
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,390
at, let's say, these
two different nodes--

323
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:08,450
I of x minus delta x and I of x.

324
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:12,560
And because there are
no membrane currents,

325
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,180
you can see that
those two currents

326
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,369
have to be equal to each other.

327
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:19,670
Kirchoff's Current Law says
that the current into this node

328
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:22,010
has to equal the current
out of that node.

329
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:24,619
So if there are no
membrane currents,

330
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:26,420
there's nothing
leaking out here,

331
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:30,910
then those two currents
have to equal each other.

332
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:32,350
And we can call that I0.

333
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:40,670
So now, dv/dx is minus
axial resistance times I0.

334
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:43,820
And what does that tell us
about how the voltage changes

335
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:48,080
in a piece of dendrite if
there's no membrane current,

336
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,612
if there's no leaky membrane?

337
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:52,070
There's no leakage
in the membrane.

338
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,730
If dv/dx is a constant,
what does it tell us?

339
00:18:06,005 --> 00:18:07,510
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

340
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,260
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

341
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,520
But decreases how?

342
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,780
What functional form?

343
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,200
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

344
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:11,720
MICHALE FEE: Good.

345
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,553
It changes linearly.

346
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,410
So if there are no
membrane conductances,

347
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:19,585
then the membrane
potential changes linearly.

348
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,660
So you can see that the voltage
as a function of position--

349
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,700
sorry I forgot to
label that voltage--

350
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,790
just changes linearly
from some initial voltage

351
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:35,960
to some final voltage
over some length l.

352
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:41,710
We're considering a case of a
piece of dendrite of length l.

353
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:42,476
Yes?

354
00:18:42,476 --> 00:18:47,592
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

355
00:18:47,592 --> 00:18:48,300
MICHALE FEE: Yep.

356
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,460
So I just rewrote this equation.

357
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,880
Sorry, I just rewrote this
equation moving the minus sign

358
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,210
to that side.

359
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:56,710
Yep.

360
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:02,710
Good.

361
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:07,810
Now you can see that the delta
V that the voltage difference

362
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,490
from the left side
to the right side

363
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:14,810
is just the total resistance
times the current-- just Ohm's

364
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:17,060
law again.

365
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:20,030
And the total resistance
is the axial resistance

366
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:22,880
per unit length
times the length.

367
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,530
Really simple.

368
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,130
Voltage changes linearly.

369
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:30,640
If you don't have any
membrane conductances,

370
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,400
and you can just write
down the relation

371
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,500
between the voltage
difference on the two

372
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,060
sides and the current.

373
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,630
So, in general, let's
think a little bit more

374
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:49,940
about this problem of being able
to what you need to write down

375
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,820
the solution to this equation.

376
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,840
It's a very simple equation.

377
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,420
If you integrate
this over x, you

378
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,940
can see that the voltage
as a function of position

379
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:03,320
is some initial voltage
minus a resistance

380
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,822
times the current times x.

381
00:20:06,822 --> 00:20:08,930
And that, again,
just looks like this.

382
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:11,540
That's where that
solution came from.

383
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:15,400
It's just integrating
this over x.

384
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,040
And you can see that
in order to write down

385
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,890
the solution to this equation,
we need a couple of things.

386
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:24,520
We need to either know the
voltages at the beginning

387
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,380
and end, or we need
to know the current.

388
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:30,040
We need to know some combination
of those three things.

389
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,670
So let's write down
the voltage here.

390
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:33,790
Let's call it V0.

391
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:38,730
Let's write down the
voltage there, V sub l,

392
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,110
and plug those in.

393
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,560
And you can see that--

394
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,540
there's V0.

395
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,800
There's V sub l.

396
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,600
You can see that if you know
any two of those quantities--

397
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,860
V0, V sub l, or Io--

398
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,450
you can calculate the third.

399
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:56,200
So if you know V0 and Vl, you
can calculate the current.

400
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,010
If you know V0 and the current,
you can calculate V sub l.

401
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:06,100
That is the concept of
boundary conditions.

402
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:10,750
You can write down the
voltages or the currents

403
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,570
at some positions
on the dendrite

404
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:18,370
and figure out
the total solution

405
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:21,220
to the voltage
[AUDIO OUT] of position.

406
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,140
Does that make sense?

407
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:26,170
If you don't know some
of those quantities,

408
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:30,220
you can't write down the
solution to the equation.

409
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,530
It's just the simple
idea that when

410
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,420
you integrate a
differential equation,

411
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:37,000
you need to have an
initial condition in order

412
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,810
to actually solve the equation.

413
00:21:43,918 --> 00:21:44,960
Any questions about that?

414
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:50,830
So let's think about a couple
of different kinds of boundary

415
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:54,200
conditions that you
might encounter.

416
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,670
So this boundary condition
right here-- so let's

417
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:01,750
say that we inject a
x amount of current I0

418
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,540
into a piece of dendrite.

419
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,430
And we take that
piece of dendrite

420
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,110
and we inject
current on one end,

421
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:12,520
and we cut the other
end so that it's open.

422
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,860
What does that produce
at the other end?

423
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,923
So we have a wire that describes
the inside of the dendrite.

424
00:22:18,923 --> 00:22:21,340
We have a wire that describes
the outside of the dendrite.

425
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:25,720
And if you cut the end of the
dendrite off so that they're--

426
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,610
it's leaky-- so
it's an open end--

427
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:31,734
what does that look
like electrically?

428
00:22:31,734 --> 00:22:34,350
Like what's the word for--

429
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,770
like those two wires
are touching each other.

430
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:38,510
What's that called?

431
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:40,650
They're shorts.

432
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,310
If you cut the end
of a dendrite off,

433
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,740
you've created a short circuit.

434
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:48,700
The inside is connected
to the outside.

435
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:53,170
So that's called an open
end boundary condition.

436
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:58,657
And what can you say about
the voltage at this end?

437
00:22:58,657 --> 00:23:00,240
If the outside is
[AUDIO OUT] what can

438
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,465
you say about the voltage
inside the dendrite at that end?

439
00:23:05,465 --> 00:23:06,340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

440
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,080
MICHALE FEE: It's 0.

441
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:08,860
Good.

442
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,620
So we have injected current.

443
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,650
We have V0, the
voltage at this end.

444
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:17,050
And we know, if we
have an open end,

445
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:19,780
that the voltage here is 0.

446
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,340
Now we can write down.

447
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:24,310
We know that the
initial voltage is V0.

448
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:28,180
The voltage at position L is 0.

449
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:31,640
And now you can--

450
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:35,410
you know that the current here
is equal to the current there,

451
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:40,990
and you can write down
the equation and solve V0.

452
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:46,960
So V0 is just the resistance,
the total resistance

453
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,420
of the dendrite times
the injected current.

454
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:58,550
And that Rin is known
as input impedance.

455
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:00,690
It's just the resistance
of the dendrite.

456
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,930
It tells you how
much voltage change

457
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:10,740
you will get if you inject
a given amount of current.

458
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,240
All right.

459
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,680
Any questions about that?

460
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,690
Let's consider another case.

461
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:18,680
Rather than having an open end,
let's leave [? the end of ?]

462
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:23,660
the dendrite closed so
that it's sealed closed.

463
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:27,440
So we're going to consider
a piece of dendrite

464
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,720
that, one end, we're
injecting current in,

465
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,842
and the other end is closed.

466
00:24:31,842 --> 00:24:33,800
So what do you think
that's going to look like?

467
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,470
It's called a closed end.

468
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:39,170
What does that look like here?

469
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,490
It's an open circuit.

470
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:44,610
Those two wires are not
connected to each other.

471
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:47,910
There's no resistance
between them.

472
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:52,190
Let's say we define
the voltage here as V0.

473
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,690
What can you say--
well, what you

474
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:56,750
can say about the current
there is that the current is 0,

475
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,670
because it's an open circuit.

476
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:01,020
There's no current flowing.

477
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:05,572
And so the current flowing
through this at this end is 0.

478
00:25:05,572 --> 00:25:07,370
Does that make sense?

479
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:11,090
So what can you say about
the current everywhere?

480
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:11,590
AUDIENCE: 0.

481
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,560
MICHALE FEE: It's 0.

482
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:16,170
And what can you say about
the voltage everywhere?

483
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:16,710
It's V0.

484
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,170
Exactly.

485
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:22,690
So the voltage
everywhere becomes V0.

486
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:26,940
And the input impedance?

487
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,970
Anybody want to guess what
the input impedance is?

488
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:34,440
How much-- what's the ratio
of the voltage at this end

489
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,790
and the current at this end?

490
00:25:40,029 --> 00:25:41,525
AUDIENCE: Infinite?

491
00:25:41,525 --> 00:25:42,650
MICHALE FEE: It's infinite.

492
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:43,192
That's right.

493
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:50,700
So we're just trying to build
some intuition about how

494
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,040
voltage looks
[AUDIO OUT] of distance

495
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:57,130
for one special case, which
is a piece of dendrite

496
00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:03,530
of some finite length for which
you have no membrane currents.

497
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:10,660
And you can see that the voltage
profile you get is linear,

498
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:14,260
and the slope of it depends
on the boundary conditions,

499
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,690
depends on whether
the piece of dendrite

500
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:19,165
has a sealed end,
whether it's open.

501
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,260
All right.

502
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,360
So now we're going to
come back to the case

503
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,810
where we have membrane
currents, and we're

504
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:36,140
going to derive the
general solution

505
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:43,550
to the voltage in a piece
of dendrite for the case

506
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:46,070
where we have membrane
capacitance and membrane

507
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:48,450
currents.

508
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:48,950
All right.

509
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:52,970
And I don't expect you to
be able to reproduce this,

510
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:55,340
but we're going to derive
what's called the cable

511
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:58,640
equation, which is the general
mathematical description,

512
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,080
the most general mathematical
description for the voltage

513
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:08,210
in a cylindrical
tube, of which--

514
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,990
that's what dendrites look like.

515
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:13,490
So we're going to write down
that differential equation,

516
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:16,520
and I want you to just
see what it looks like

517
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,573
and where it comes
from, but I don't expect

518
00:27:18,573 --> 00:27:19,740
you to be able to derive it.

519
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:24,970
All right.

520
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:28,990
So let's come back to this
simple model that we started.

521
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:34,300
We're going to put our model
for the membrane back in.

522
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:40,060
Remember, that's a capacitor
and a conductance in parallel.

523
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:45,680
We're going to-- we can write
down the membrane current,

524
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,230
and we're going to have an
injected current per unit

525
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,260
length.

526
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,020
So Kirchoff's
current law tells us

527
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:56,690
the sum of all of those currents
into each node has to be 0.

528
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:58,795
So let's just write down--

529
00:27:58,795 --> 00:28:00,170
let's just write
down an equation

530
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:02,840
that sums together all of
those and sets them to 0.

531
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:07,400
So the membrane current
leaking out minus that

532
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,930
injected current coming in.

533
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:12,380
They have positive signs because
one is defined as positive

534
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:17,150
going into the dendrite,
and the other one

535
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:20,540
is defined as
positive going out.

536
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,580
So those two, the
membrane currents,

537
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:26,810
plus the current going out this
way minus the current coming

538
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:28,910
in that way is 0.

539
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,660
So we're going to do the
same trick we did last time.

540
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:37,700
We're going to
divide by delta x.

541
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:42,350
So, again, membrane current per
unit length times the length

542
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,630
of this finite element.

543
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:46,010
We're going to
divide by delta x.

544
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:50,630
So this thing right
here, i membrane minus i

545
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:55,760
electrode, I guess, equals minus
1 over delta x I of x minus I

546
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,250
of x minus delta x.

547
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,480
So what is this?

548
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,130
You've seen something
like that before.

549
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:05,310
It's just a derivative.

550
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:10,130
First derivative of I
with respect to position.

551
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:13,460
So now what you see is
that the membrane current

552
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:17,090
minus the injected current is
just the first derivative of I.

553
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:19,010
So hang in there.

554
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:21,530
We're going to substitute
that with something that

555
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:23,660
depends on voltage.

556
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,140
So how do we do that?

557
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,170
We're going to take Ohm's law.

558
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:28,460
There's Ohm's law.

559
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:31,610
Let's take the derivative of
that with respect to position.

560
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:34,930
So now we get the second
derivative of voltage

561
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:37,620
with respect to position
is just equal to minus

562
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:40,750
Ra times the first
derivative of current.

563
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:47,310
And you can see we can just take
this and substitute it there.

564
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:51,270
So here's what we get, that the
second derivative of voltage

565
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:57,480
with respect to position is
just equal to the membrane

566
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:01,440
or injected current coming into
the dendrite at any position.

567
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:07,130
So the curvature of the
voltage, how curved it is,

568
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:10,865
just depends on what's coming
in through the membrane.

569
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:17,110
Remember, in the case where
we had no membrane current

570
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:20,530
and no injected current,
the curvature was 0,

571
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:24,280
d2V dx squared is 0, which,
if the curvature is 0,

572
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,423
then what do you have?

573
00:30:26,423 --> 00:30:27,090
A straight line.

574
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:37,820
Now, we're going to plug
in the right equation

575
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:40,250
for our membrane current.

576
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:41,906
What is that?

577
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:43,050
That we know.

578
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:45,660
It's just a sum of two terms.

579
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:46,180
What is it?

580
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,580
It's the sum of--

581
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:53,220
remember, this is going to be
the same as our soma model.

582
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:53,940
What was that?

583
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,590
We had two terms.

584
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:58,330
What were they?

585
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:00,690
The current through the
membrane in the model,

586
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:02,850
in the Hodgkin-Huxley model is?

587
00:31:06,024 --> 00:31:07,176
What's that?

588
00:31:07,176 --> 00:31:08,590
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

589
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,340
MICHALE FEE: Good.

590
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:13,270
It's a capacitive current
and a membrane ionic current.

591
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:15,530
So let's just plug that in.

592
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:19,500
We're just going to substitute
into here the current

593
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,060
through the capacitor
and the current

594
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,490
through this conductance.

595
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:30,515
That's just C dV dt
G times V minus EL.

596
00:31:30,515 --> 00:31:35,690
It's a capacitive part
and a resistive part.

597
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:38,080
Now, the capacitance
is a little funny.

598
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:43,270
It's capacitance per unit length
times the length of the element

599
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:43,840
plus--

600
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,540
and the [AUDIO OUT] is
conductance per unit length

601
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,355
times the length of
our finite element.

602
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:56,250
Capacitance per unit length
and ionic conductance

603
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,000
per unit length.

604
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,730
And we're going to
plug that into there.

605
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:05,210
We're first going to notice that
this E leak is just an offset,

606
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:06,370
so we can just ignore it.

607
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:08,260
We can just set it to 0.

608
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,770
We can always add it
back later if we want.

609
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:14,650
We divide both sides by the
membrane conductance per unit

610
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:17,510
length to get this equation.

611
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:20,440
And that's called
the cable equation.

612
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,310
It's got a term with the
second derivative of voltage

613
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,740
with respect to
position, and it's

614
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:29,920
got a term that's the
first derivative of voltage

615
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,250
with respect to time.

616
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,160
That's because of the capacitor.

617
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:43,080
And then it's got a term that
just depends on [AUDIO OUT]..

618
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,530
Now, that's the most
general equation.

619
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:50,240
It describes how the voltage
changes in a dendrite

620
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,230
if you inject a
pulse of current,

621
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:56,125
how that current will propagate
down the dendrite or down

622
00:32:56,125 --> 00:32:56,625
an axon.

623
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,960
We're going to take
a simplifying case.

624
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,940
Next, we're going to study the
case just of the steady state

625
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,760
solution to this.

626
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,770
But I want you to
see this and to see

627
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:22,710
how it was derived just using
finite element analysis,

628
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:28,080
deriving Ohm's law in a
one-dimensional continuous

629
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,100
medium.

630
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:33,150
And by plugging in the
equation for the membrane that

631
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:36,500
includes the capacitive
and resistive parts,

632
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:39,440
you can derive
this full equation

633
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:44,230
for how the voltage changes
in a piece of dendrite.

634
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,720
Now, there are a couple of
interesting constants here

635
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,160
that are important--

636
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,960
lambda and tau.

637
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,520
So lambda has units of length.

638
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,370
Notice that all of
the denominators

639
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:56,750
here have units of voltage.

640
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:59,530
So this is voltage
per distance squared.

641
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:01,030
So in order to have
the right units,

642
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,770
you have to multiply
by something

643
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:05,990
that's distance squared.

644
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:07,970
This is voltage per
unit time, so you

645
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:12,190
have to multiply by something
that has units of time.

646
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:14,969
So that is the length
constant right there,

647
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,830
and that is a time constant.

648
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:20,489
And the length constant
is defined as 1

649
00:34:20,489 --> 00:34:22,739
over membrane conductance.

650
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:27,010
That's the conductance of the
membrane, through the membrane,

651
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:32,429
and this is the axial
resistance down the dendrite.

652
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:36,699
So this is conductance
per unit length,

653
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:39,940
and this is resistance
per unit length.

654
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:42,219
And when you multiply
those things together,

655
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:47,045
you get two per unit length
down in the denominator.

656
00:34:47,045 --> 00:34:48,670
So when you put those
in the numerator,

657
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:51,060
you get length squared.

658
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,480
And then you take
the square root,

659
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,870
and that gives you
units of length.

660
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:57,960
The time constant is
just the capacitance

661
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,900
per unit length divided by the
conductance per unit length.

662
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,060
And that is the
membrane time constant,

663
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,490
and that's exactly the
same as the membrane time

664
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:09,780
constant that we
had for our cell.

665
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:13,260
It's a property of the
membrane, not the geometry.

666
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,250
So any questions about that?

667
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,400
It was-- it's a lot.

668
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,610
I just wanted you to see it.

669
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:21,333
Yes, [INAUDIBLE].

670
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:25,715
AUDIENCE: Like, two
slides ago [INAUDIBLE]

671
00:35:25,715 --> 00:35:26,840
MICHALE FEE: This one, or--

672
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,412
AUDIENCE: One more
slide [INAUDIBLE]..

673
00:35:29,412 --> 00:35:30,370
MICHALE FEE: Yes, here.

674
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:33,268
AUDIENCE: So when you plug that
in for the derivative of V,

675
00:35:33,268 --> 00:35:37,293
were we not assuming that there
was no membrane [INAUDIBLE]??

676
00:35:37,293 --> 00:35:37,960
MICHALE FEE: No.

677
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,170
That equation is still correct.

678
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:42,220
AUDIENCE: OK.

679
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:45,550
MICHALE FEE: It's-- voltage
is the derivative with respect

680
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:49,400
to position as a function
of the axial current.

681
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,080
AUDIENCE: OK.

682
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:50,747
MICHALE FEE: OK?

683
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:04,300
Remember, going back
up to here, notice

684
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:08,650
that when we derive this
equation right here,

685
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:11,560
we didn't even have to
include these membrane.

686
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,797
They don't change anything.

687
00:36:12,797 --> 00:36:13,630
It's just Ohm's law.

688
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:16,300
It's the voltage here
minus the voltage

689
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,630
there has to equal the current
flowing through that resistor.

690
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:22,300
Doesn't matter what other
currents-- whether current

691
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,980
is flowing in other
directions here.

692
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:24,800
AUDIENCE: OK.

693
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,410
MICHALE FEE: Does
that make sense?

694
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:29,700
The current through
that resistor

695
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,610
is just given by the
voltage difference

696
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:34,520
on either side of it.

697
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,240
That's Ohm's law.

698
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,430
So now we're going to
take a simple example.

699
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:48,010
We're going to
solve that equation

700
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:51,550
for the case of steady state.

701
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:53,890
How are we going to
take the steady state?

702
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:57,610
How are we going to
find the steady state

703
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:59,350
version of this equation?

704
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:01,210
Any idea?

705
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:02,560
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

706
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,310
MICHALE FEE: Good.

707
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:05,320
We just set dV dt
to 0, and we're

708
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:09,990
left with this equals that.

709
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:13,770
So we're going to take
a piece of our cable,

710
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:16,500
and we're going
to imagine that we

711
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,750
take a piece of dendrite
that's infinitely long

712
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:21,060
in either direction.

713
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,840
And somewhere here in the middle
of it, we're going to inject--

714
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,590
we're going to put an
electrode, and we're

715
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:29,755
going to inject current
at one position.

716
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,760
So it's injecting
current at position 0.

717
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,110
How many of you have heard of
a delta function, a Dirac delta

718
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:40,610
function?

719
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:41,110
OK.

720
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:44,220
So we're going to
define the current

721
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,400
as a function of position
as just a current times

722
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,160
a Dirac delta function
of x, that just says

723
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,800
that all the current is
going in at position 0,

724
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:58,020
and no current is
going in anywhere else.

725
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,440
So the Dirac delta
function is just--

726
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:05,270
it's a peaky thing that is
very narrow and very tall, such

727
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:07,190
that when you integrate
over it, you get a 1.

728
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:16,480
So we're going to go to
the steady state solution.

729
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,540
And now let's write down that.

730
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:22,310
So there's the steady
state cable equation.

731
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:25,230
And we're going to inject
current at a single point.

732
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,817
So that's what it looks like.

733
00:38:26,817 --> 00:38:28,400
Does anyone know the
solution to this?

734
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,640
Notice, what this says
is we have a function.

735
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:35,320
It's equal to the second
derivative of that function.

736
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,470
Anybody know?

737
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:42,780
There's only one
function that does this.

738
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,790
It's an exponential.

739
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:45,930
That's right.

740
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:51,090
So the solution to this
equation is an exponential.

741
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:57,740
V of position is V0, some
voltage in the middle,

742
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:00,020
e to the minus x over lambda.

743
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,580
Why do I have an absolute value?

744
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,650
What is the voltage
going to look like if I

745
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:06,290
inject current right here?

746
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:07,850
You're going to have
current flowing.

747
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:09,183
Where's the current going to go?

748
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,680
If I inject current into the
middle of a piece of dendrite,

749
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,290
is it all going to go this way?

750
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:17,790
No.

751
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:19,260
What's it going to do?

752
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,385
It's going to go both ways.

753
00:39:23,328 --> 00:39:25,620
And the current-- the voltage
is going to be high here,

754
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:30,560
and it's going to fall as
you go in both directions.

755
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,580
That's why we have an
absolute value here.

756
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:35,700
So the voltage is going
to start at some V0 that

757
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,870
depends on how much
current we're injecting,

758
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:44,010
and it's going to drop
exponentially on both sides.

759
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:48,930
And notice what's right here.

760
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:55,970
The lambda tells us
the 1 over e point,

761
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:59,150
how far away the 1 over e
point of the voltage is.

762
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,890
What that means is
that the voltage is

763
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:06,960
going to fall to 1 over e
of V0 at a distance lambda

764
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,815
from the side at which
the current is injected.

765
00:40:11,815 --> 00:40:12,840
Does that make sense?

766
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:16,980
That is the steady
state space constant.

767
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,632
It has units of length.

768
00:40:19,632 --> 00:40:24,650
It's how far away do you have
to go so that the voltage falls

769
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:26,390
to 1 over--

770
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:33,405
falls to 1 over 2.7 of
the initial voltage.

771
00:40:42,156 --> 00:40:44,330
Any questions?

772
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:46,640
It's pretty simple.

773
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:53,110
We took an unusually
complicated route to get there,

774
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:56,650
but that's the-- the nice
thing about that is you've seen

775
00:40:56,650 --> 00:41:00,180
the most general
solution to how a cable--

776
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:03,070
a dendrite will behave when
you inject current into it.

777
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,780
So now we can
calculate the current

778
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,070
as a function of position.

779
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:14,540
Any idea how to do that?

780
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:17,620
What-- if you know
voltage, what do you

781
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:20,470
use to calculate current?

782
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:21,093
Which law?

783
00:41:21,093 --> 00:41:21,760
AUDIENCE: Ohm's.

784
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,410
MICHALE FEE: Ohm's law.

785
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:26,020
Anybody remember what
Ohm's law looks like here?

786
00:41:29,796 --> 00:41:33,100
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

787
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,020
MICHALE FEE: Yes.

788
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,050
And we have to do
something else.

789
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:40,080
The-- remember, the
current is what?

790
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,290
Ohm's law in a continuous
medium, the current

791
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:46,380
is just going to be
what of the voltage,

792
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,810
the blank of the voltage?

793
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:49,800
AUDIENCE: Derivative?

794
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,190
MICHALE FEE: The
derivative of the voltage.

795
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:53,565
So we're just going to take
this and take the derivative.

796
00:41:53,565 --> 00:41:54,390
That's it.

797
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:57,810
dV dx is just equal
to minus R times I.

798
00:41:57,810 --> 00:42:00,360
So the current is proportional
to the derivative of this.

799
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,190
What's the derivative
of an exponential?

800
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:07,715
Just another exponential.

801
00:42:07,715 --> 00:42:08,340
So there we go.

802
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,090
The current, and
then there's some--

803
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:12,002
you have to bring
the lambda down

804
00:42:12,002 --> 00:42:13,210
when you take the derivative.

805
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:17,520
So the current is now just minus
1 over the axial resistance per

806
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,700
unit length times
minus V0 over lambda--

807
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:25,220
lambda comes down when
you take the derivative--

808
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:28,760
times e to the
minus x over lambda.

809
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:32,190
Notice, the current is to
the right on this side,

810
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:34,310
so the current is
positive it's flowing

811
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:37,490
to the left on that side,
so the current is negative.

812
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:40,190
So to do this properly,
you'd have-- this is

813
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:42,320
the solution on the right side.

814
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,930
You'd have to write another
version of this for the current

815
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:47,013
on the left side, but I
haven't put that in there.

816
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:55,150
And, again, the current
starts out at I0,

817
00:42:55,150 --> 00:43:01,430
and drops exponentially,
and it falls to 1 over e

818
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:03,560
at a distance lambda.

819
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,190
Why is that?

820
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:06,890
Because the current
is leaking out

821
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:11,530
through the holes
in our garden hose.

822
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:16,330
So as you go further down,
less and less of the current

823
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:18,780
is still going
down the dendrite.

824
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,530
I don't expect you to
be able to derive this,

825
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:27,820
but, again, just know
where it comes from.

826
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:28,810
Comes from Ohm's law.

827
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:38,840
So I want to show you one really
cool thing about the space

828
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:39,770
constant.

829
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:42,530
It has a really
important dependence

830
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:46,333
on the size of the dendrite.

831
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:47,750
And we're going
to learn something

832
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:53,060
really interesting about why
the brain has action potentials.

833
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:57,050
So let's take a closer
look at the space constant,

834
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:58,670
and how you
calculate it, and how

835
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:01,950
it depends on the
size, this diameter,

836
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:04,450
this radius of the dendrite.

837
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:08,330
So we're going to take a
little cylinder of dendrite

838
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:10,580
of radius a length little l.

839
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,550
G sub m is the membrane
conductance per unit length.

840
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:21,590
Let's just derive what
that would look like.

841
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:27,450
The total membrane conductance
of this little cylinder

842
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:33,510
of dendrite, little
cylinder of cell membrane,

843
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:42,100
is just the surface area of that
cylinder times the conductance

844
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:43,420
per unit area.

845
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:45,340
Remember, this is the
same idea that we've

846
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:47,050
talked about when
we were talking

847
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:50,530
about the area of our soma.

848
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:53,020
We have a conductance
per unit area

849
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:55,810
that just depends on the
number of ion channels

850
00:44:55,810 --> 00:44:59,560
and how open they are on
that piece of membrane.

851
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,720
So the total conductance
is just going

852
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:06,410
to be the conductance per
unit area times the area.

853
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:09,710
And the area of that
cylinder is 2 pi a--

854
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:11,270
that gives us the
circumference--

855
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:13,520
times the length, 2 pi al.

856
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,070
And the conductance
per unit length

857
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:27,200
is just that total conductance
divided by the length.

858
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:33,190
So it's 2 pi a times g sub l,
the conductance per unit area.

859
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:36,410
So that's membrane
conductance per unit length.

860
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:42,760
The axial resistance
per unit length

861
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:45,580
along this piece, this
little cylinder of dendrite,

862
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:47,780
we can calculate
in a similar way.

863
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:52,750
The total axial resistance
along that dendrite is--

864
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:56,080
can be calculated using this
equation that we developed

865
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:59,950
on the very first day,
the resistance of a wire

866
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:03,790
in the brain, the resistance
of a chunk of extracellular

867
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:04,990
or intracellular solution.

868
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:10,900
The resistance is
just the resistivity

869
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:14,390
times the length
divided by the area.

870
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:20,000
The longer-- for a given
medium of some resistivity,

871
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,690
the longer you have to
run your current through,

872
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:26,120
the bigger the resistance
is going to be.

873
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:29,300
And the bigger the area,
the lower the resistance

874
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,340
is going to be.

875
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:34,690
So that total resistance is--
it has units of ohm-millimeters.

876
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:38,150
So it's the resistivity
times l divided by A.

877
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:42,410
In intracellular space, that's
around 2,000 ohm-millimeters.

878
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:47,310
And the cross-sectional area
is just pi times a squared.

879
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:49,440
So now we can calculate
the axial resistance

880
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,160
per unit length.

881
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,100
That's the total
resistance divided by l.

882
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:55,690
So that's just
resistivity divided by A,

883
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:59,700
which is resistivity divided
by pi radius squared, just

884
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:02,160
the cross-sectional
area, and that has

885
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,170
units of ohms per millimeter.

886
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:07,260
So now we can calculate the
steady state space constant.

887
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:11,100
Conductance per unit
length and axial resistance

888
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:14,250
for unit length-- the
space constant is just 1

889
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:17,550
over the product of
those two, square root.

890
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:21,020
We're just going to
notice that that's

891
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:25,130
siemens per millimeter, ohms
per millimeter, inverse ohms.

892
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:28,310
So those cancel, and you're
left with millimeter squared,

893
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:30,090
square root, which
is just millimeters.

894
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:33,700
So, again, that has the
right units, units of length.

895
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:36,520
But now let's plug
these two things

896
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,505
into this equation
for the space constant

897
00:47:38,505 --> 00:47:43,682
and calculate how
it depends on a.

898
00:47:43,682 --> 00:47:44,390
So let's do that.

899
00:47:47,243 --> 00:47:48,910
Actually, the first
thing I wanted to do

900
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:51,040
is just show you what
a typical lambda is

901
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,050
for a piece of dendrite.

902
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:54,550
So let's do that.

903
00:47:54,550 --> 00:48:00,430
Conductance per area is around
5 times 10 to the minus 7,

904
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:01,030
typically.

905
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:02,860
So the conductance
per unit length

906
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:06,070
of a dendrite, 6
nanosiemens per millimeter.

907
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:07,990
You don't have to remember that.

908
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:10,570
We're just calculating
the length constant.

909
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:13,990
Axial resistance is--
plugging in the numbers

910
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:19,735
for a piece of dendrite that's
about 2 microns in radius,

911
00:48:19,735 --> 00:48:21,850
the axial resistance
per unit length

912
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:26,420
is about 60 megaohms
per millimeter.

913
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:30,470
And so when you plug those two
things to calculate lambda,

914
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:34,250
you find that lambda for a
typical piece of dendrite

915
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:35,920
is about a millimeter.

916
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:45,490
So that's a number that I would
hope that you would remember.

917
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:47,870
That's a typical space constant.

918
00:48:47,870 --> 00:48:56,180
So if you inject a signal into
a piece of dendrite, it's gone--

919
00:48:56,180 --> 00:49:01,160
it's mostly gone or about
2/3 gone in a millimeter.

920
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:07,870
And that's how you
can have dendrites

921
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:11,110
that are up in the range
of close to a millimeter,

922
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:13,300
and they still are
able to conduct

923
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:17,980
a signal from synaptic inputs
out onto the dendrite down

924
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:18,820
to the soma.

925
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:27,420
So a millimeter is a
typical length scale

926
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:30,018
for how far signals propagate.

927
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:35,180
So now let's plug in those--

928
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:40,370
the expressions that we derived
for conductance per unit length

929
00:49:40,370 --> 00:49:44,060
and axial resistance
for unit length of a

930
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:47,100
into this equation for
the space constant.

931
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:49,820
And what you find is
that the space constant

932
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,700
is a divided by 2
times the resistivity

933
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:55,520
times the membrane
conductance per unit

934
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:00,420
area, per area to the 1/2.

935
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:02,540
It goes as the square root.

936
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:07,340
The space constant, the
length, goes as the square root

937
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:10,390
of the radius.

938
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:13,160
And notice that
the space constant

939
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:19,520
gets bigger as you increase
the size of the dendrite.

940
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,580
As you make a dendrite
bigger, what happens

941
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:28,100
is the resistance down
the middle gets smaller.

942
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:31,460
And so the current can go
further down the dendrite

943
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:33,506
before it leaks out.

944
00:50:33,506 --> 00:50:36,130
Does that make sense?

945
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:38,850
But the resistance
[AUDIO OUT] is

946
00:50:38,850 --> 00:50:43,140
dropping as the
square of the area,

947
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:48,680
but the surface area is
only increasing linearly.

948
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:53,220
And so the resistance
down the middle

949
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:54,420
is dropping as the square.

950
00:50:57,732 --> 00:51:03,050
The conductance out the
side is growing more slowly.

951
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:05,970
And so the signal
can propagate further

952
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:09,630
the bigger the dendrite is.

953
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:16,230
So that's why-- it's very
closely related to why

954
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:19,070
the squid giant axon is big.

955
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:21,110
Because the current
has more access

956
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:28,180
to propagate down the axon
the bigger the cylinder is.

957
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:30,220
But there are limits to this.

958
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:33,430
So you know that, in
our brains, neurons

959
00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:36,760
need to be able to send signals
from one side of our head

960
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:42,540
to the other side of our
head, which is about how big?

961
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:43,840
How far is that?

962
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:53,115
Not in Homer, but in [AUDIO OUT]
seen the cartoon with little--

963
00:51:53,115 --> 00:51:53,740
OK, never mind.

964
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,400
How big across is the brain?

965
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,720
How many millimeters, about?

966
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:03,240
Yes.

967
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:09,030
Order of magnitude,
let's call it 100.

968
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:14,740
So a piece of dendrite
2 microns across

969
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:19,690
has a length constant
of a millimeter.

970
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:27,320
How-- what diameter dendrite
would we need if we needed

971
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:35,610
to send a signal across the
brain passively through a piece

972
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:36,650
of--

973
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:40,660
a cylindrical piece
of dendrite like this?

974
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:48,660
So lambda scales with radius.

975
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:56,130
2 microns diameter, radius,
gives you 1 millimeter.

976
00:52:56,130 --> 00:53:02,100
Now you want to go to-- you
want to go 100 times further.

977
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:06,773
How-- by what factor larger
does the radius have to be?

978
00:53:06,773 --> 00:53:07,720
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

979
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,416
MICHALE FEE: 10,000.

980
00:53:09,416 --> 00:53:10,630
Good.

981
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:18,190
And so how big does our 2-micron
radius piece of dendrite

982
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:23,950
have to be to send a
signal 100 millimeters?

983
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:28,130
10,000 times 2
microns, what is that?

984
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:28,983
Anybody?

985
00:53:32,847 --> 00:53:34,790
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

986
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:36,290
MICHALE FEE: 2 centimeters.

987
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:45,050
So if you want to make
a piece of dendrite that

988
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:47,030
sends a signal from
one side of your brain

989
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:50,056
to the other 100
millimeters away,

990
00:53:50,056 --> 00:53:51,675
you need 2 centimeters across.

991
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:58,800
Actually, that's the radius.

992
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,240
It needs to be 4
centimeters. across.

993
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:05,620
Doesn't work, does it?

994
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:09,160
So you can make things-- you can
make signals propagate further

995
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,590
by making dendrites
bigger, but it only

996
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:13,400
goes as the square root.

997
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,910
It's like diffusion.

998
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:21,258
it's only-- it
increases very slowly.

999
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:23,550
So in order to get a signal
from one side of your brain

1000
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:25,500
to the other with the
same kind of membrane,

1001
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:30,070
your dendrite would have to
be 4 centimeters in diameter.

1002
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:36,260
So that's why the
brain doesn't use

1003
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:39,830
passive propagation of
signals to get from one place

1004
00:54:39,830 --> 00:54:41,330
to the other.

1005
00:54:41,330 --> 00:54:47,420
It uses action potentials that
actively propagate down axons.

1006
00:54:53,118 --> 00:54:53,910
Pretty cool, right?

1007
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:02,130
All right.

1008
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:08,070
So I want to just introduce
you to the concept

1009
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:10,680
of electrotonic length.

1010
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:12,790
And the idea is very simple.

1011
00:55:12,790 --> 00:55:16,530
If we have a piece of dendrite
that has some physical length

1012
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:21,370
l, you can see
that that length l

1013
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:31,560
might be very good at conducting
signals to the soma if what?

1014
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:34,800
If-- what aspects
of that dendrite

1015
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:38,810
would make it very good at
conducting signals to the soma?

1016
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:39,970
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1017
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:41,470
MICHALE FEE: So it's big.

1018
00:55:41,470 --> 00:55:42,430
Or what else?

1019
00:55:42,430 --> 00:55:44,120
AUDIENCE: Short.

1020
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:46,330
MICHALE FEE: It's got a
fixed physical length l,

1021
00:55:46,330 --> 00:55:48,736
so let's think of
something else.

1022
00:55:48,736 --> 00:55:50,550
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1023
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:52,250
MICHALE FEE: Less leaky.

1024
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:53,190
Right.

1025
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:53,790
OK.

1026
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:56,940
So depending on the
properties of that dendrite,

1027
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:59,700
that piece of dendrite
of physical length l

1028
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:04,080
might be very good at
sending signals to the soma,

1029
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:08,970
or it might be very bad if
it's really thin, really leaky.

1030
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:13,210
So we have to compare
the physical length

1031
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:15,790
to the space constant.

1032
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:19,300
So in this case, there's
very little decay.

1033
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:24,940
The signal is able to propagate
from the site of the synapse

1034
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:26,410
to the soma.

1035
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:29,260
In this case, a slightly
smaller piece of dendrite

1036
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:31,240
might have a shorter
lambda, and so there

1037
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:34,430
would be more decay by the
time you get to the soma.

1038
00:56:34,430 --> 00:56:38,500
And in this case, the
lambda is really short,

1039
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,540
and so the signal
really decays away

1040
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:44,280
before you get to the soma.

1041
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:47,240
So people often refer
to a quantity as the--

1042
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:50,060
referred to as the
electrotonic length,

1043
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:54,440
which is simply the ratio of
the physical length to the space

1044
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:56,030
constant.

1045
00:56:56,030 --> 00:56:58,710
So you can see
that in this case,

1046
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:02,810
the physical length is
about the same as lambda,

1047
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:06,340
and so the electrotonic
length is 1.

1048
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:08,470
In this case, the
physical length

1049
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:12,430
is twice as long as lambda,
and so the electrotonic length

1050
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:14,390
of that piece of dendrite is 2.

1051
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:17,600
And in this case, it's 4.

1052
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,970
And you can see that the amount
of signal it gets from this end

1053
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:24,060
to that end will go like what?

1054
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:28,908
Will depend how on the
electrotonic length?

1055
00:57:28,908 --> 00:57:34,240
It will depend something
like e to the minus L.

1056
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:39,550
So a piece of dendrite that
has a low electrotonic length

1057
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:42,550
means that the synapse out
here at the other end of it

1058
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:46,000
is effectively very
close to the soma.

1059
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,690
It's very effective at
transmitting that signal.

1060
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:52,150
If the electrotonic
length is large,

1061
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:56,680
it's telling you that some
input out here at the end of it

1062
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:58,120
is very far away.

1063
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:01,090
The signal can't
propagate to the soma.

1064
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:03,460
And the amount of signal
that gets to the soma

1065
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:07,870
goes as e to the minus L,
e to the minus [AUDIO OUT]..

1066
00:58:07,870 --> 00:58:10,030
So if I told you
that a signal is

1067
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:11,410
at the end of a
piece of dendrite

1068
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:14,950
that has electrotonic length
2, how much of that signal

1069
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:16,050
arrives at the soma.

1070
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:24,270
The answer is e to the minus
2, about 10%, whatever that is.

1071
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:32,520
So I want to tell
you a little bit more

1072
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:40,240
about the way people model
complex dendrites in--

1073
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:41,420
sort of in real life.

1074
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:46,210
So most of the time, we're
not integrating or solving

1075
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:47,180
the cable equation.

1076
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:49,360
The cable equation
is really most

1077
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:52,630
powerful in terms
of giving intuition

1078
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:55,320
about how cables respond.

1079
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:57,310
So you can write
down exact solutions

1080
00:58:57,310 --> 00:59:00,250
to things like pulses
of current input

1081
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:03,850
at some position, how the
voltage propagates down

1082
00:59:03,850 --> 00:59:09,810
the dendrite, the functional
form of the voltage

1083
00:59:09,810 --> 00:59:11,260
as a function of distance.

1084
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:14,530
But when you actually want
to sort of model a neuron,

1085
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:17,230
you're not usually integrating
the cable equation.

1086
00:59:17,230 --> 00:59:20,140
And so people do
different approximations

1087
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:23,590
to a very complex dendritic
structure like this.

1088
00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:26,440
And one common way
that that's done

1089
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,695
is called
multi-compartment model.

1090
00:59:28,695 --> 00:59:30,070
So, basically,
what you can do is

1091
00:59:30,070 --> 00:59:35,860
you can model the soma with this
capacitor-resistor combination.

1092
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:38,710
And then you can
model the connection

1093
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:42,430
to another part of the
dendrite through a resistor

1094
00:59:42,430 --> 00:59:45,880
to another sort of
finite element slice,

1095
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:48,550
but we're gonna let the
slices go to 0 length.

1096
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:52,240
We're just going to model them
as, like, chunks of dendrites,

1097
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:56,860
that are going to be modeled
by a compartment like this.

1098
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:59,290
And then that can
branch to connect

1099
00:59:59,290 --> 01:00:01,360
to other parts of the
dendrite, and that

1100
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:04,760
can branch to connect to
other parts of the model

1101
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,550
that model other
pieces [AUDIO OUT]

1102
01:00:06,550 --> 01:00:08,920
So you can basically
take something like this

1103
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:11,800
and make it
arbitrarily complicated

1104
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:16,780
and arbitrarily close
to a representation

1105
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:20,010
of the physical structure
of a real dendrite.

1106
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:22,400
And so there are
labs that do this,

1107
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:28,150
that take a picture
of a neuron like this

1108
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:30,220
and break it up
into little chunks,

1109
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:32,230
and model each one of
those little chunks,

1110
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:35,650
and model the branching
structure of the real dendrite.

1111
01:00:35,650 --> 01:00:40,060
And you can put in real ionic
conductances of different types

1112
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:41,530
out here in this model.

1113
01:00:41,530 --> 01:00:45,650
And you get a gazillion
differential equations.

1114
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:47,860
And you can [AUDIO OUT]
those differential equations

1115
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:53,180
and actually compute,
sort of predict

1116
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:56,150
the behavior of a complex
piece of dendrite like this.

1117
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:03,710
Now, that's not my favorite
way of doing modeling.

1118
01:01:03,710 --> 01:01:07,250
Any idea why that would be--

1119
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:12,910
why there could be a better way
of modeling a complex dendrite?

1120
01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:16,310
I mean, what's the--
one of the problems

1121
01:01:16,310 --> 01:01:19,640
here is that, in a
sense, your model

1122
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:24,130
gets to be as complicated
as the real thing.

1123
01:01:24,130 --> 01:01:28,870
So it would be-- it's a great
way to simulate some behavior,

1124
01:01:28,870 --> 01:01:32,140
but it's not a great way of
getting an intuition about how

1125
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:33,205
something works.

1126
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:41,880
So people take simplified
versions of this,

1127
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:44,490
and they can take this
very complex model

1128
01:01:44,490 --> 01:01:48,100
and simplify it even more by
doing something like this.

1129
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:51,050
So you take a soma
and a dendrite.

1130
01:01:51,050 --> 01:01:53,390
You can basically just
break off the dendrite

1131
01:01:53,390 --> 01:01:56,048
into a separate piece and
connect it to the soma

1132
01:01:56,048 --> 01:01:56,840
through a resistor.

1133
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:02,390
Now, we can simplify
this even more

1134
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:07,470
by just turning it into
another little module,

1135
01:02:07,470 --> 01:02:11,490
a little compartment, that's
kind of like the soma.

1136
01:02:11,490 --> 01:02:14,280
It just has a capacitor,
and a membrane resistance,

1137
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:16,810
and whatever ion
channels in it you want.

1138
01:02:16,810 --> 01:02:19,290
And it's a dendritic
compartment that's

1139
01:02:19,290 --> 01:02:22,530
connected to the somatic
compartment through a resistor.

1140
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:26,040
And if you write that down,
it just looks like this.

1141
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:28,080
So you have a
somatic compartment

1142
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:31,140
that has a somatic
membrane capacitance,

1143
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:35,085
somatic membrane conductances,
a somatic voltage.

1144
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:37,710
You have a dendritic compartment
that has all the same things--

1145
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:40,893
dendritic membrane capacitance,
conductances, and voltage,

1146
01:02:40,893 --> 01:02:43,185
and they're just connected
through a coupling resistor.

1147
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:49,990
It turns out that
that very simple model

1148
01:02:49,990 --> 01:02:54,430
can explain a lot of complicated
things about neurons.

1149
01:02:54,430 --> 01:02:57,190
So there are some
really beautiful studies

1150
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:59,950
showing that this kind
of model can really

1151
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:05,800
explain very diverse kinds
of electrophysiological

1152
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,090
[AUDIO OUT] neurons.

1153
01:03:07,090 --> 01:03:16,570
So you can take, for example,
a simple model of a layer 2/3

1154
01:03:16,570 --> 01:03:22,540
pyramidal cell that has a
simple, compact dendrite.

1155
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:24,500
And you can write
down a model like this

1156
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:27,470
where you have different
conduct [AUDIO OUT] dendrite.

1157
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:31,850
You have Hodgkin-Huxley
conductances in the soma.

1158
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:34,202
You connect them
through this resistor.

1159
01:03:34,202 --> 01:03:35,660
And now, basically,
what you can do

1160
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:37,910
is you can model that
spiking behavior.

1161
01:03:37,910 --> 01:03:42,180
And what you find is that if
you have the same conductances

1162
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:45,060
in the dendrite and in
the soma but you simply

1163
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:50,922
increase the area, the total
area of this compartment,

1164
01:03:50,922 --> 01:03:54,820
just increase the total
capacitance and conductances,

1165
01:03:54,820 --> 01:03:56,280
that you can see that--

1166
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:59,050
and that would model
a layer 5 neuron that

1167
01:03:59,050 --> 01:04:01,000
has one of these very
large dendrites--

1168
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,780
you can see that the spiking
behavior of that neuron

1169
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:06,490
just totally changes.

1170
01:04:06,490 --> 01:04:09,400
And that's exactly what the
spiking behavior of layer 5

1171
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,920
neurons looks like.

1172
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:18,610
And so you could imagine
building a very complicated

1173
01:04:18,610 --> 01:04:21,570
thousand-compartment
model to simulate this,

1174
01:04:21,570 --> 01:04:23,760
but you wouldn't really
understand much more

1175
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,530
about why it behaves that way.

1176
01:04:25,530 --> 01:04:27,630
Whereas [AUDIO OUT] a
simple two-compartment

1177
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:30,960
model and analyze it,
and really understand

1178
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,940
what are the
properties of a neuron

1179
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:35,070
that give this kind
of behavior as opposed

1180
01:04:35,070 --> 01:04:37,390
to some other kind of behavior.

1181
01:04:37,390 --> 01:04:39,480
It's very similar
to the approach

1182
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:45,110
that David Corey took in
modeling the effect of the T

1183
01:04:45,110 --> 01:04:51,540
tubules on muscle fiber
spiking in the case of sodium--

1184
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:55,170
failures of the sodium
channel to inactivate.

1185
01:04:55,170 --> 01:04:57,030
That was also a
two-compartment model.

1186
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:04,580
So you can get a
lot of intuition

1187
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:07,490
about the properties
of neurons [AUDIO OUT]

1188
01:05:07,490 --> 01:05:11,840
simple extensions of an
additional compartment

1189
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:14,820
onto the soma.

1190
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:20,530
And, next time,
on Thursday, we're

1191
01:05:20,530 --> 01:05:22,840
going to extend
a model like this

1192
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:29,410
to include a model
of a [AUDIO OUT]

1193
01:05:29,410 --> 01:05:33,390
So let me just remind you of
what we learned about today.

1194
01:05:33,390 --> 01:05:36,890
So you should be able
to draw a circuit

1195
01:05:36,890 --> 01:05:41,270
diagram of a dendrite, just that
kind of finite element picture,

1196
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:45,500
with maybe three or
four elements on it.

1197
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:48,240
Be able to plot the
voltage in a dendrite

1198
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,970
as a function of
distance in steady state

1199
01:05:50,970 --> 01:05:52,770
for leaky and
non-leaky dendrites,

1200
01:05:52,770 --> 01:05:56,770
and understand the concept
of a length constant.

1201
01:05:56,770 --> 01:05:59,500
Know how the length constant
depends on dendritic radius.

1202
01:06:03,030 --> 01:06:05,915
You should understand the
idea of an electrotonic length

1203
01:06:05,915 --> 01:06:09,120
and be able to say
how much a signal will

1204
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:13,260
decay for a dendrite of a
given electrotonic length.

1205
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:15,210
And be able to draw
the circuit diagram

1206
01:06:15,210 --> 01:06:16,590
of a two-compartment model.

1207
01:06:16,590 --> 01:06:20,600
And we're going to spend more
time on that on Thursday.
