8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,840
WILL MA: So today
I promised I would

9
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,390
play through the second
half of the tournament

10
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:27,670
that I started last
time, so two times ago,

11
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:31,320
but before Jennifer
Shahade's guest lecture.

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,820
But before I start,
so remember last time

13
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,440
we got to the final table.

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,750
This is essentially the
start of the final table.

15
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,870
And but before I
get into the hands,

16
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,870
I want to do a bit of
theory first that I've been

17
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,910
forgoing so far in this class.

18
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:49,510
And it's essentially what's
called the independent chip

19
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,460
mode, or ICM theory.

20
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:56,010
And essentially what it's
used for is in tournaments,

21
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,460
essentially the value of
chips is essentially nonlinear

22
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,700
because you're not really trying
to just get all the chips.

23
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,470
You are trying to last
as long as possible

24
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,130
and move up the payouts.

25
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:10,360
So I want to now formally
quantify what this means

26
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,866
and how you calculate the
EV of your game rules.

27
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:17,170
So far I think
I've just told you

28
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,840
everything that's done so far
in this class has been chip EV.

29
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,050
And I've told you just
play to maximize chip EV.

30
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,929
Maximize your expected
number of chips.

31
00:01:24,929 --> 00:01:26,720
And that's a pretty
reasonable way to play.

32
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,350
In cash games, it's
what you want to do.

33
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:32,450
And in tournaments it's
not a bad approximation.

34
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,150
So I don't want everyone
after this ICM lecture

35
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,192
to think, you know, I've
got to completely change

36
00:01:37,192 --> 00:01:39,441
my playing in tournaments
because that's not the case.

37
00:01:39,441 --> 00:01:40,900
Essentially, playing
and maximizing

38
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,960
expected number of chips is
a pretty good approximation

39
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,790
of how you actually
should be playing.

40
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,980
But there are some
small differences

41
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,900
in extreme situations,
and I'd like

42
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,680
to highlight some of that today.

43
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,800
So OK, yeah.

44
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,770
So this is essentially-- so it's
this idea of minimizing risk

45
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:00,640
to stay alive and move up
to the escalating payouts.

46
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,980
So I want to make an
important distinction, though.

47
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,170
When I'm saying,
we're still trying

48
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,840
to maximize our expected
amount of money.

49
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,780
What I'm saying, you should
be minimizing your risk

50
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,690
in a tournament so that you
can move up the payouts.

51
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:17,500
That's different than
saying you should minimize

52
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,020
your monetary risk
because I'm still

53
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:23,680
assuming we're trying to
maximize our expected money

54
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,970
without worrying about risk.

55
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:28,090
But we're only minimizing
tournament risk

56
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,520
to maximize your
expected amount of money.

57
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,680
But I'm not saying
we should be overly

58
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,080
conservative in a
tournament and just

59
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,360
trying to move up the
money ladder slowly

60
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,110
when you should be gambling
because it's positive money

61
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,250
expectation.

62
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,930
If you find yourself
in this situation,

63
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:47,260
then if you're trying to
play professionally and just

64
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,840
maximize your expected amount
of money in every situation,

65
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,970
then you should probably
play smaller tournaments,

66
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,535
where this is not
really the case--

67
00:02:53,535 --> 00:02:55,950
where this doesn't
occur too often.

68
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,570
I can understand in practice,
if you play poker for fun

69
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,280
and you made it
far in a tournament

70
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,120
and it's the top,
let's say, 50K,

71
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,810
and there's 55 left, I can
understand why you might not

72
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:15,120
want to make a positive money
expectation play because you've

73
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,170
played this tournament.

74
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:18,170
You're probably not going
to be in the situation

75
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,930
that many times
in your lifetime.

76
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,000
And you just really
want to cash the World

77
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,666
Series of Poker main
event or something.

78
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,750
And I think that's a
reasonable life decision.

79
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,625
I'm not criticizing
that life decision.

80
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,365
But I'm going to talk about
all of these decisions

81
00:03:33,365 --> 00:03:35,200
assuming we don't
care about that.

82
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,290
We're still trying to maximize
expected amount of money.

83
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,880
And if you are playing
professionally,

84
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,800
where you're getting into that
situation very frequently,

85
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,690
then it is very important to
maximize risk in some cases

86
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:51,640
and to maximize your dollar EV
because in tournaments, you're

87
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,820
losing most of the time.

88
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:58,060
You really have to win a lot
the times that you do win.

89
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:03,360
You can't be content
because we made $30,000

90
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,710
if we could have made $50,000.

91
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,379
So OK.

92
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:09,670
So what is the exact formula
for ICM/ So I'm just going

93
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:13,240
to demonstrate how to
calculate the value of chips

94
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,980
in a tournament with an example.

95
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,149
So ICM is essentially
a formula to calculate

96
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:21,279
how much your stack is
worth in a tournament.

97
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,620
So let's suppose there's
three players left

98
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,480
and that payouts are 5, 3, 2.

99
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,240
This is a common
structure in sit-and-goes

100
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,425
if you've played those, which
are 10-player tournaments.

101
00:04:30,425 --> 00:04:32,050
So this is the
statement is essentially

102
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,060
your chances of winning
the tournament is

103
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,850
proportional to your
percent of the total chips.

104
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:39,570
And essentially we're
assuming this is true,

105
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:43,510
and we're going to derive
from it all the formulas.

106
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,250
And this statement is
approximately true.

107
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,800
There are more advanced
ICM calculators

108
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,900
that also take into
account your position

109
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,050
if the stack sizes are rather
shallow because there are

110
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,570
some inaccuracies
because this statement,

111
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,520
it calculates only
based on chips.

112
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,560
But if you're folding
and then you're

113
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,110
the button the next hand,
which is the best position,

114
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:05,400
then that's actually
an entire big blind

115
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,954
better almost than being
under the gun the next hand.

116
00:05:07,954 --> 00:05:09,620
But we're not going
to worry about that.

117
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,410
We're just going to
assume your chances

118
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,910
of winning the tournament is
proportional to your percentage

119
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:14,440
of chips.

120
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,470
So how do we calculate this?

121
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,380
So you can't really do
it by hand in practice.

122
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,070
But for this example
with three people,

123
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,900
I'll show you how
to do it by hand.

124
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,440
So let's suppose the chips
stacks are also 5, 3, 2.

125
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,480
OK, so the payouts are 5, 3, 2.

126
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,110
And the chip stacks
are also 5, 3, 2 ratio.

127
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:36,900
If chip EV equals money EV,
then the guy with 5,000,

128
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,160
their equity from the
tournament should be $5.

129
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,990
And the guy in third
place, their equity

130
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,370
should be $2, right?

131
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:46,750
But this is clearly not correct
because the guy in third place

132
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,170
is guaranteed $2.

133
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:49,699
And clearly there's
a nonzero chance

134
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:50,990
of them winning the tournament.

135
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:54,050
So clearly their equity
is actually more than $2.

136
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,270
And then similarly
if you're player A,

137
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:59,450
your equity is clearly not $5
because you're not guaranteed

138
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,950
to win the tournament.

139
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:04,130
So it's clear from this
example why if you just do chip

140
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,110
EV equals money EV,
that's clearly wrong.

141
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:10,040
Is that clear to everyone?

142
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,900
So how do we calculate it?

143
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,595
So let's calculate
it for player C.

144
00:06:13,595 --> 00:06:15,470
So essentially what it's
saying, your chances

145
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,700
of winning, your
chances of coming first

146
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:21,290
is 2,000 over
10,000, which is 20%.

147
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,530
And then to calculate your
chances of coming second,

148
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:26,930
you just condition on each
of the other player's way.

149
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,580
So conditioned on
A winning, which

150
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,566
would happen 50% of
the time, we assume

151
00:06:30,566 --> 00:06:31,940
that our chances
of coming second

152
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:36,529
is 2,000 divided by 5,000,
which is the remaining

153
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,820
number of chips besides player
A. Does that make sense?

154
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,670
So player A has 5,000 chips.

155
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:45,310
So between you who's
player C and player D,

156
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:48,320
there's 5,000 chips in total,
and you got 2,000 of those.

157
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,680
So it's 2,000 over
5,000, so it's 0.4.

158
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,350
And then if player B wins, then
your chances of coming second

159
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,210
is 2,000 over 7,000.

160
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:00,520
So overall, your chances
of coming second is 0.4--

161
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:07,820
So it says, 50% times
0.4 plus 30% times 2/7,

162
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,470
which equals 2/7.

163
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,300
So then you can
calculate your equity

164
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,830
is-- you're guaranteed $2.

165
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,600
And you have a 20% chance of
winning, which would give you

166
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,000
three additional dollars.

167
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,550
And then a 29% chance of coming
second, which would give you

168
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,750
an additional dollar.

169
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,870
So your equity is actually
2.89 in this case.

170
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:28,522
is actually closer to second
place than third place.

171
00:07:28,522 --> 00:07:30,600
Does that calculation
make sense to everyone?

172
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,220
So if there's five
players, you just

173
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,820
have to recursively condition.

174
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,160
You have to condition on
player A winning and then

175
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,500
go through all the possibilities
of who can come second.

176
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,880
Then go through all
the possibilities

177
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,838
of who could comes third,
et cetera, et cetera.

178
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:46,760
So it's not a calculation you
can really do in your head.

179
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:51,300
But that it's quite easy to find
a calculator to do it for you.

180
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,110
You just Google ICM calculator,
and you punch it in.

181
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,910
And even though it's not--

182
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,080
it grows exponentially.

183
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,990
But there's only going
to be nine players.

184
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,300
So it's still fine.

185
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,246
It won't take that--

186
00:08:02,246 --> 00:08:03,620
the computer can
do it instantly,

187
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,550
even for 9-10 players.

188
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:12,780
OK, so what are some cases
where ICM is easy to calculate?

189
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:16,730
So like I said, in cash games,
there is no such thing as ICM.

190
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,400
You're just playing to maximize
expected number of chips.

191
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,890
And your goal is
essentially, you're

192
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:25,650
sitting out at the cash game
looking to get into all-ins,

193
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,380
looking to get into
favorable all-ins,

194
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:32,510
hopefully winning the person
who you're targeting's money.

195
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,450
And in winner-takes-all
tournaments,

196
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:37,277
it's also the same
because you're just

197
00:08:37,277 --> 00:08:39,360
looking at your chances
of winning the tournament.

198
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,260
And that's always just
your number of chips.

199
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,634
So you're just
trying to maximize

200
00:08:42,634 --> 00:08:44,690
expected number of chips.

201
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,120
So as a corollary, once it
gets down to two players,

202
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,660
there's no more
such thing as ICM.

203
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,835
Three is the minimum
number of players you

204
00:08:51,835 --> 00:08:53,600
need for ICM to be relevant.

205
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,840
Once it's two players, it's
just maximize your chip EV

206
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,390
because there's no sense of
trying to survive in hopes

207
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,950
that someone else busts first.

208
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,850
Because with only two people,
for the other guy to bust,

209
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,380
you have to take
all their chips.

210
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,010
OK, so what are some
mathematical corollaries

211
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,260
of ICM formula?

212
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,380
So big stacks have money
EV less than chip EV.

213
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:21,240
Small stacks have money
EV greater than chip EV.

214
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,432
Small stacks also tend to have
positive chip EV in general.

215
00:09:24,432 --> 00:09:26,390
This is something I didn't
mention to you much.

216
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,740
But in general-- so you
might have seen this

217
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,900
if you guys have been to a
casino and played cash games.

218
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,620
So let's say you sit down
at a table in a cash game

219
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,710
and everyone buys in
for 100 big blinds.

220
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:41,020
At some tables, usually
they'll allow you to buy in

221
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,490
for as low as 20 big blinds.

222
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:46,300
And if you do this,
in general, that's

223
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,590
going to be positive EV for
the guy with 20 big blinds

224
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,560
because there's situations
where they have to--

225
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,940
Where, let's say, they have
to essentially sometimes

226
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:58,960
one guy will raise.

227
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,040
One guy will call.

228
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,510
And then you can go all in.

229
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,210
And one guy will go
all in on top of you.

230
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,500
And the other guy will fold.

231
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,500
And then you have dead money.

232
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,230
So another thing is early
on in the tournament,

233
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,454
ICM is irrelevant.

234
00:10:12,454 --> 00:10:13,870
You just want to
accumulate chips.

235
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:18,160
So if you try to do this formula
early on in a tournament, what

236
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,050
you'll find is
essentially you're

237
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,660
so far away from the money
that none of the things

238
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,790
really matter to maximize
your chances of even

239
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,960
getting to the money.

240
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,440
You just want to maximize
your number of chips.

241
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,830
So where is ICM most relevant?

242
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:36,340
It's most relevant on
the exact payout bubble

243
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,240
and on the final table.

244
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,600
So roughly speaking, in
every poker tournament

245
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,680
I've seen other than strange
ones that are winner-takes-all

246
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,020
or satellites, the payout
looks roughly like this.

247
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,240
So it's 0.

248
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,560
You go in, and once you hit
about top 20% is the bubble.

249
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:58,180
And then there's a jump here
where suddenly you get paid.

250
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:01,430
This is about 80% get 0.

251
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:03,290
So here there's a
jump, and then it

252
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:07,195
escalates slowly until you
get to the final table.

253
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,420
Final-- sorry, I'll
actually switched to color--

254
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,650
final table.

255
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,780
And then it escalates
really fast.

256
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:20,170
So essentially basically ICM
is most relevant at the points

257
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,160
where essentially,
the derivative,

258
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,040
or the rate of change
the payout, is highest.

259
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,480
And those points, as you
can see, are here and here.

260
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,850
So essentially it matters
most at the exact money bubble

261
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:36,280
and in the final table.

262
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,495
OK, let me clear this.

263
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,200
OK, so yeah, so
some more extreme

264
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,960
examples of ICM
you have one chip

265
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,060
left late in the tournament
when everyone else

266
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,200
has thousands of chips.

267
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,970
So clearly this ship
is worth a lot more

268
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:52,190
than its value as a
fraction of the chips.

269
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:54,410
And you're just trying to
survive with this one chip

270
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,690
essentially instead of
trying to win more chips.

271
00:12:00,002 --> 00:12:01,460
Maybe I'll calculate
this in a bit.

272
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,507
So in satellites--
what satellites are

273
00:12:03,507 --> 00:12:05,090
are there are
tournaments where you're

274
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:07,430
trying to qualify for
a bigger tournament.

275
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,380
So essentially the
important thing

276
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,020
is there will be
maybe 100 players.

277
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,430
And there will be
10 seats, which

278
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:16,560
means the top 10 get an invite
to the bigger tournament.

279
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,110
And then everyone
else gets nothing.

280
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:21,320
So I guess the qualifiers for
the MIT Series of Poker Main

281
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,846
Event are kind of like this.

282
00:12:23,846 --> 00:12:25,220
I guess there's
other prizes, to.

283
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,094
But you're essentially
trying to come top 10.

284
00:12:27,094 --> 00:12:29,330
So this is how that works.

285
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:33,860
And in that case, the
payout is essentially this.

286
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,300
So there's not really
much incentive to win.

287
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,970
You're just trying to be one
of this top 10% that gets paid.

288
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:44,210
So that's another case where
ICM has extreme importance.

289
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:45,220
And you often find--

290
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,300
well, not often--
but you can often

291
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,620
make a case for folding
pocket aces preflop

292
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,830
even though you know it's
going to have positive chip

293
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:56,030
EV if you call because it's
the best possible hand.

294
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:59,310
But because you just really
don't want to bust, then

295
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,610
just you want to fold aces.

296
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:05,014
OK, we'll talk about
this a bit more later.

297
00:13:05,014 --> 00:13:06,680
OK, so let's get back
to the tournament.

298
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,290
So this is the final table.

299
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:13,810
So ICM is going to be
quite relevant here.

300
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,980
As I'm talking through my
decisions in the hands,

301
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,520
I'll talk about the
ICM decisions as well.

302
00:13:22,415 --> 00:13:27,800
This is the first hand, or I
think maybe one orbit passed.

303
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,720
We're at the final table.

304
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,064
We're the second biggest stack.

305
00:13:33,064 --> 00:13:34,730
We should maybe look
at the stack sizes.

306
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,450
So we look around
at the stack sizes.

307
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,325
So what do you notice
about the stack sizes?

308
00:13:38,325 --> 00:13:40,560
Or specifically,
how are we doing?

309
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,115
How many chips do we have?

310
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:43,990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

311
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,021
WILL MA: Real.

312
00:13:46,021 --> 00:13:46,520
Right.

313
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,590
We have quite a lot, right?

314
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,030
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

315
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,540
WILL MA: We have quite a lot,
but we're not in first place.

316
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,640
There's this one
guy who covers us.

317
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,930
So this Panpancrisy
guy who covers us.

318
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:00,140
So specifically, the
thing I'm trying to avoid

319
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:04,250
is getting in a big
pot with Panpancrisy.

320
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,220
Let's say he goes all in,
and I have pocket kings.

321
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,360
I'm going to call.

322
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,000
But I'm not going to be
that happy about calling

323
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,760
in a situation where otherwise
I should be very unhappy.

324
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,060
Just because chances are
he's going to have an ace.

325
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,660
He's going to have 30% equity.

326
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,900
It's still going to be
positive money EV call,

327
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:24,750
but it's so bad if I basically
bust right now in eighth place

328
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,270
against Panpancrisy.

329
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:29,120
So essentially I'm
really incentivized

330
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,612
to avoid getting in
big pots with him.

331
00:14:31,612 --> 00:14:34,070
And I'm essentially hoping for
some of these smaller stacks

332
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:37,490
to bust so that then, even
if I lose a big pot to him,

333
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:40,130
I don't get the low
eighth place payout.

334
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:43,070
So OK, so it's folded of us.

335
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,720
We raise here.

336
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,880
I think this is one
of the weakest hands I

337
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,260
am raising from the button.

338
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:51,110
But so far players have
seemed to be reasonably tight,

339
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,730
so I'm going to raise.

340
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,390
And then I get the blinds.

341
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:01,250
OK, so I'll skip some
hands at the beginning.

342
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,440
Near the end, I'll
play every hand.

343
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,810
This hand we don't play, but
I'll try to show the hands

344
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,119
were someone busts.

345
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:08,660
So this hand small
blind goes all in.

346
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,100
Big blind calls.

347
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,330
And so small blind
wins with 10-2

348
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,110
suited against ace-4, which is
basically great for everyone

349
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,240
at the table.

350
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,310
Because someone
busted, you're always

351
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:22,120
cheering for people
who bust essentially.

352
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,620
And I think also both
of their plays are fine.

353
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,590
So I think small blinds
play-- it looks a bit silly.

354
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:32,010
But realistically not only does
10-2 suited have reasonable

355
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,130
equity when you're
called, it's also--

356
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:36,650
the ICM is very, very relevant.

357
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:40,430
This Gerardocks guy,
he's not the shortest.

358
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:43,130
He is one of the shortest, so
he does need to take some risk,

359
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,270
but he's still really
very much would like

360
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:49,070
to bust after I show to Heap78.

361
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:51,020
So he can't call with anything.

362
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,600
With ace-4, I think that's
definitely good enough to call.

363
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,870
But let's say they
have king-2 offsuit.

364
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,560
I think that's the situation
I'd normally call if it was not

365
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,000
a final table in a tournament.

366
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,610
But at the final table,
where I'm not the shortest

367
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,150
and there's someone
shorter than me,

368
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,995
I would consider folding 10-2--

369
00:16:06,995 --> 00:16:14,740
sorry, king-2 offsuit here just
because of ICM essentially.

370
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,760
All right, so the next hand--

371
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,450
so the big blind busts.

372
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,350
And then there's no
small blind in this hand,

373
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:25,050
which is great because people
are less incentivized to steal.

374
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,135
And indeed we get
our big blind back.

375
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,010
AUDIENCE: That works.

376
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,610
WILL MA: Very nice.

377
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,030
OK, so not much happens here.

378
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,040
I'll skip forward a bit.

379
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:38,200
OK, this hand--

380
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,010
I guess it's quite
convenient for us.

381
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:42,440
But this still
illustrates a point.

382
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,540
So this guy, who
dealt a bit earlier,

383
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,550
now he goes all in
for quite a lot.

384
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,050
This is quite a big shove.

385
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,540
And if you play by
my recommendations,

386
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:55,320
I would never recommend
shoving this many bets.

387
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,810
It's 24.

388
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:57,845
That's quite a lot--

389
00:16:57,845 --> 00:16:59,280
actually, 23, sorry.

390
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:03,110
It's 23 big blinds, which
is way too much to shove.

391
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,270
There's no need
to risk this much.

392
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:08,660
But once again, I think his play
is justifiable because of ICM.

393
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:12,560
So let's see what he had.

394
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,280
So we call.

395
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,099
Here it's a bit
different because even

396
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:20,390
if I call and lose, I'm
not out of the tournament.

397
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:23,420
Even if I would be out,
even if he had 200,000,

398
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,160
I'd probably still
call with queens.

399
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,439
It's just too good to fold.

400
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,480
So we need ace-queen here,
which is great for us.

401
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,790
But if you look at the play
from his perspective again,

402
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,370
it actually seems
quite reasonable

403
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:37,160
if you think about it
because for him, ace-queen

404
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,840
is a great hand
from this position.

405
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,150
It's definitely
good enough where

406
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:45,110
if it was between folding and
shoving for 23 big blinds,

407
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:47,900
you would definitely rather
shove for 23 big blinds.

408
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,520
So the main reason why normally
one would criticize his play

409
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,950
is because why doesn't he just
raise small with ace-queen?

410
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,610
Well, understandably,
he doesn't really

411
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:01,160
want to incentivize me
to reraise or Panpancrisy

412
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:01,910
to make a reraise.

413
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:04,790
He essentially wants
to minimize the chances

414
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:08,160
that he has to play for
his stack in this hand.

415
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,520
And the way he does that is
essentially by going all in.

416
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:16,310
Looking at back at it, I
think his play is fine.

417
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,790
The only weakness of
his play, I think,

418
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:23,120
is it is a bit predictable what
his hand is in this situation

419
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,720
because I think if he had a
hand as good as pocket aces,

420
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,227
then he shouldn't be doing this.

421
00:18:28,227 --> 00:18:30,560
He should just be raising
small because it's good enough

422
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:35,130
where he's happy getting it
in against me or Panpancrisy.

423
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:38,250
Whereas also if his
hand was slightly worse,

424
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,370
like ace-jack offsuit I
think is a good example,

425
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:44,150
I think ace-jack offsuit
is not strong enough

426
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,550
to make this all-in play with.

427
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,090
But you still want
to be raising.

428
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,490
So I think there's a
small range of hands

429
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,470
that you want to be making
this all-in play is.

430
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:55,520
I think it's basically
exactly he's queen offsuit,

431
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,040
may ace-king, maybe
ace-queen, ace-king.

432
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:02,420
And then middle pairs, let's
say between like pocket 8s

433
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,760
and pocket 10s or something.

434
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,740
So the only downside
of this play I think

435
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,560
is essentially his range
here is very predictable it's

436
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:13,710
going to be ace-jack suited
plus ace-queen and pocket 8s

437
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,500
through 10s or
something like that.

438
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,530
But nonetheless, I think,
because it's a final table,

439
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:21,401
because of ICM, it's fine.

440
00:19:21,401 --> 00:19:22,400
He gets unlucky, though.

441
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,954
He runs into queens.

442
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,370
All right, here
we've got to walk.

443
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,400
OK, so let's see this hand.

444
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,920
So I showed to--

445
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,270
raises goes all in.

446
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,080
So we call here.

447
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,680
We're deep enough where I want
to give myself the opportunity

448
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,680
to fold if Panpancrisy
he goes all-in.

449
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,070
And we call.

450
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:45,870
And we win.

451
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,389
So OK, so I guess
I've been running

452
00:19:47,389 --> 00:19:48,680
pretty good in this tournament.

453
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,440
But I just want to
point out, there

454
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,434
is a lot of selection
bias here because I'm not

455
00:19:53,434 --> 00:19:54,850
going to play
through a tournament

456
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:57,300
where I get all-in on
the first hand and lose.

457
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,010
So I mean I'm going to pick a
tournament that I [INAUDIBLE]..

458
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:03,760
So it's in some sense not
the best pedagogical example

459
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,481
because there is a
lot of selection bias.

460
00:20:06,481 --> 00:20:08,980
You know that I'm going to run
very good in the tournament I

461
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,030
choose to show you guys.

462
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:13,400
But if it's between that
and having be over in

463
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,100
five minutes because I lost--

464
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,256
[LAUGHTER]

465
00:20:17,256 --> 00:20:18,685
--this is the
lesser of two evils.

466
00:20:22,516 --> 00:20:24,830
All right, so here, yeah.

467
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:27,170
So once again, this is a
pretty-- it's not that big,

468
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:30,340
but it's a 17 big blind shove.

469
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,810
And once again, it's
justified by ICM prefold.

470
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,650
OK, here, queen-7 off.

471
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:39,880
Yeah, I shove.

472
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,130
I think it's probably barely a--

473
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:46,210
I think it's pretty close
if chip EV equals money EV.

474
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:49,080
It would be a borderline
shove with the smallish antes.

475
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:53,910
But given ICM, I know he's
less incentivized to call

476
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:54,410
than usual.

477
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:57,270
So all borderline hands I'm
going to be shoving, so I do.

478
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:04,770
OK, so this hand we get king-10.

479
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:07,170
So once again, I just shove.

480
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:10,410
Once again, I think I--

481
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:13,080
basically it's hard for
them to call if I just shove

482
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,570
and because of ICM.

483
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,640
So I'm essentially
bullying him, bully them.

484
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,015
So when you're
the big stack, you

485
00:21:19,015 --> 00:21:24,180
can bully people at the
final table because of ICM.

486
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,770
We do get lucked
up here, though.

487
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,090
And we get lucked up at ace-8.

488
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:31,360
And so he wins.

489
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,030
I'm not going to do
an exact calculation

490
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:35,670
because I'm going to do an
exact ICM calculation later.

491
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:42,710
I would guess his call
is very borderline.

492
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:45,360
It's definitely positive
chip expectancy,

493
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,820
but the fact that there's
this guy with only 57,000

494
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:52,710
and this guy with 70,000,
I think it's a call.

495
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:55,194
But I think ace-6 is
definitely a fold.

496
00:21:55,194 --> 00:21:57,360
So I think it's probably
one of the weakest hands he

497
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,318
should be calling with.

498
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:00,166
I think ace-8 is
probably too good.

499
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:02,790
He has to call, but I think it's
very borderline in either case

500
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:05,380
because of ICM.

501
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:08,020
So he does fold, though.

502
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:11,630
So now ICM is a bit trickier
because now we're smaller.

503
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,130
We're getting it all in with
any of these guys can really

504
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,150
damage us.

505
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,010
And there's still
two short stacks

506
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:19,590
that everyone is
hoping will bust soon.

507
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:25,450
So In this situation, I
could go all in and bully

508
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:29,730
this Panpancrisy guy, but
ICM isn't that relevant.

509
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:32,070
He's not going to fold
ace-queen if I go all in.

510
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:34,140
So I just give this one to him.

511
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:39,510
Calling is probably bad
anyway, but calling, I think,

512
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,310
is especially bad
because it just

513
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:44,780
increases the chances of
getting in a bigger pot.

514
00:22:47,881 --> 00:22:49,357
OK, we'll skip forward a bit.

515
00:22:49,357 --> 00:22:50,190
Let's see this hand.

516
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,340
So ace-10 off here.

517
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,460
So this guy makes it 12,000.

518
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,100
And I guess I've skipped
a bunch of hands.

519
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,890
So Nicholas Brody, I think,
has been very active.

520
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:04,960
And overall, I think people
have become very active.

521
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,540
Everyone's playing
a lot of pots.

522
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:10,380
So overall, I am going to
put people on wider ranges

523
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,780
than I normally do.

524
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,900
But nonetheless here,
I still fold ace-10.

525
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,810
I think it's ace-jack I
would probably get it in.

526
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:22,080
And ace-10 suited, I
think I'd get it in.

527
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,290
Ace-10 suited is borderline.

528
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:30,330
Once again, when you're tied
between getting in a smaller

529
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:36,030
pot and getting in a bigger
pot, you want to be folding.

530
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,447
Yeah, so I guess
at a final table,

531
00:23:37,447 --> 00:23:38,488
I should make this clear.

532
00:23:38,488 --> 00:23:40,020
It's not like you
want to fold more.

533
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:43,540
It's you want to go all in
more when you're first to act.

534
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,956
But call other
people's all-ins less.

535
00:23:45,956 --> 00:23:47,580
So that's exactly
what's going on here.

536
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,200
He's already moved all in.

537
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,920
And I'm going to
fold to his all-in

538
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,980
more often than
in a normal game.

539
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:56,250
But as you can see,
I haven't really

540
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:59,350
been tighter in every sense
because when I get to go first,

541
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:02,310
I think actually going all
in more often and risking it

542
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,620
more often because I
know my opponents are

543
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:08,161
highly incentivized to fold.

544
00:24:08,161 --> 00:24:08,910
So they go all in.

545
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:10,020
I fold here.

546
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,880
So Nicholas Brody also
folds, which I guess is fine.

547
00:24:15,214 --> 00:24:17,130
Definitely he had pretty
odds he called there.

548
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,520
But once again, ICM just makes--

549
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,220
it changes things up a bit.

550
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,340
Jack-7 suited, once again,
is a pretty big shove,

551
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,099
but jack-7 suited plenty
good [INAUDIBLE]----

552
00:24:29,099 --> 00:24:29,640
ICM relevant.

553
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,720
Pocket 9s here.

554
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,750
We make it 12,000 on the button.

555
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:39,090
So here I think pocket
9s is good enough

556
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:42,300
where I'm happy if one of them
reraises all-in, and I call.

557
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,340
So essentially my
strategy here is

558
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,520
I'm going to shove all
my medium strength hands

559
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,020
and especially hands
that don't play

560
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,900
well postflop ace-2 offsuit.

561
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:55,320
And then I'm going to raise
small with some of my hands

562
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,140
that are less good preflop but
better postflop, let's say,

563
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:02,910
10-8 suited, and also my
monster hands like pocket nines

564
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:05,250
that are also reasonable
to play postflop.

565
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:10,140
So Nicholas Brody calls here.

566
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:13,350
And the flop is ace,
jack, 7 with the hearts.

567
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,120
So it's a bad flop
for our hand, but it's

568
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,020
a good flop for
our range because I

569
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:22,300
think, given the way the table
was going, I was opening a lot.

570
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,930
And Nicholas Brody
is very aggressive.

571
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:26,620
I would guess unless
he had like pocket

572
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:31,670
aces, which he might slow
play, he would reraise most.

573
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:35,180
I wasn't 100% sure-confident,
but I was reasonable--

574
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:39,770
I'd say maybe 85% confident
that if he had an ace preflop,

575
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:41,760
he would have just
went all in preflop.

576
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,781
So overall, I'd still say it's
a very good flop for my range

577
00:25:44,781 --> 00:25:47,280
because I think he's way less
likely to have an ace than me.

578
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,680
There's a small
chance maybe he would

579
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:53,030
chicken out with ace-2
offsuit and just call.

580
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,660
But given how
aggressive he's been,

581
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,220
I would be surprised
if he did that.

582
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,770
So I decided to bet here.

583
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:01,590
And I'm still not sure
how good this bet is.

584
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:04,060
So I think at the
time I bet, because

585
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:07,620
of my logic that it's really
hard for him to have an ace,

586
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:10,230
and so I think the best
strategy for me on this flop

587
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:14,190
and in this situation is to
just bet 100% of my hands.

588
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:16,860
And he's just forced
to fold basically

589
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,660
very often because he can't
really keep up with an ace.

590
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:22,020
I can just continue betting.

591
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,060
That being said,
though, I do think

592
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,550
if I do decide as
part of my strategy

593
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,530
to check any part
of my range here,

594
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:31,680
pocket 9s might actually be
one of the best possible hands

595
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,410
to check back.

596
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:34,530
So I think checking back
would have been fine.

597
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:36,870
I guess I'd bet here
because I told myself,

598
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:40,680
I want my strategy to be bet
100% of my hands, which I did.

599
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:46,200
And he folds, which is
reasonably smart because he

600
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,710
knows that I can bet again.

601
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:50,340
And he's going to have to make
a decision for all his chips

602
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:50,940
probably.

603
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,273
And it's just going to be tough.

604
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,680
OK, this hand--

605
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:01,881
BeMySponsor goes all
in, gets [INAUDIBLE]..

606
00:27:05,318 --> 00:27:07,330
Yeah?

607
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:10,645
AUDIENCE: Why would you say,
pocket 9s is one of the best

608
00:27:10,645 --> 00:27:11,760
hands to check back here?

609
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,040
WILL MA: I very rarely
get called by worse,

610
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,980
and I get called by
everything better.

611
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:24,680
I think he's always calling a
jack and usually folding a 7.

612
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,050
Maybe he won't fold 7-8
with some back door draws,

613
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:29,295
but I think he'll
usually call a jack.

614
00:27:29,295 --> 00:27:31,020
And maybe he'll
call a 7 sometimes.

615
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,670
But I still think mostly
it's just he'll basically

616
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:36,055
fold everything that beats
me and call everything that--

617
00:27:36,055 --> 00:27:39,010
sorry, he'll fold everything
that I beat and call everything

618
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:40,672
that beats me basically.

619
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:46,630
Yeah, but I still decide
to bet, nonetheless, just

620
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,310
to win the pot there
and not give him

621
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:52,037
extra outs if he happens to
have 10-6 suited or something.

622
00:27:54,719 --> 00:27:56,260
So OK, so we'll go
through this hand.

623
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,640
So Panpancrisy raises.

624
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,940
He doesn't go all
in, which is curious.

625
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,230
But LPMBox calls.

626
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,430
He calls again.

627
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:04,700
It's checked.

628
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:08,257
And then LPMBox goes on
in the river [INAUDIBLE]..

629
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,300
OK, jack-7 here?

630
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,094
Yes.

631
00:28:14,094 --> 00:28:16,010
I guess, so once again,
Nicholas Brady raises.

632
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:20,290
And then LPMBox goes on
over him, wins a big pot.

633
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,810
So I guess I do the
same for Nicholas Brady.

634
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:29,290
He's been raising a lot,
so pockets 6s good enough

635
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,700
to risk going all in there.

636
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,120
OK, this hand-- so we
get ace-jack suited.

637
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,720
And I raise from cutoff.

638
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,270
So I've been raising
to a fairly small size

639
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:44,700
because the antes are smaller.

640
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,290
So that's one thing to
remember at a final table is

641
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:50,140
the pots are actually a bit
smaller because with only five

642
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:53,680
players the ante, the sum of
the antes, instead of normally

643
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,530
the 6,000, is only
3,000 in this case.

644
00:28:56,530 --> 00:29:00,080
So the big blind has
worse odds to call.

645
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,860
So Nicholas Brady goes all in.

646
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,940
I look him up ace-jack suited--

647
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,320
definitely good enough.

648
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,810
Also at this point,
because a number of pots

649
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:11,500
have gone my way, I'm big enough
where even if I call and lose

650
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:15,730
this, I won't be chip
leader, but I'll still

651
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:18,550
have a decent amount of chips.

652
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,810
So unfortunately we
lose the ace-8 here.

653
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:22,750
So now we're second
place, but we're still

654
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:23,800
doing reasonably well.

655
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:31,661
I could just maybe
gone all in here.

656
00:29:31,661 --> 00:29:33,160
I guess this guy
has a lot of chips.

657
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,650
But I could've raised
to a bigger size

658
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:38,530
to disincentive Nicholas
Brody from doing this

659
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:40,030
with the right
wide range of hands

660
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:44,050
and then protecting my stack
more from an ICM point of view.

661
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:45,310
But I'm happy with--

662
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:47,200
I think ace-jack suited
is just good enough

663
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,147
where I'm happy
calling his all-in,

664
00:29:50,147 --> 00:29:51,730
which I should have
been in this case.

665
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:52,820
I guess he had ace-6.

666
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,270
OK, so jack-10 suited here.

667
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:04,120
So yeah, here I just
decided to fold.

668
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,680
I mean we could consider
doing a crazy bluff all-in,

669
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:10,160
but I don't think this
guy's folding that often.

670
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,760
They made a rather
big reraise preflop

671
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:18,492
from going three times
the initial opening.

672
00:30:18,492 --> 00:30:21,830
So Nicholas Brody goes all
in here, and they do fold.

673
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,860
So Nicholas Brody picking
up a bunch of chips.

674
00:30:27,264 --> 00:30:28,555
So he just takes it down again.

675
00:30:28,555 --> 00:30:29,850
He's been raising quite a lot.

676
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,400
Here we get a raise and a call.

677
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:45,950
So LPMBox has been raising
over other people's--

678
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:47,020
opens quite a lot.

679
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,490
So he gets called here,
but he holds and wins,

680
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:52,270
which is definitely
bad news for everyone.

681
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:56,110
If I could pay 10,000
chips into the pot

682
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:58,024
to have this all-in
go the other way,

683
00:30:58,024 --> 00:30:59,690
it almost certainly
would be profitable.

684
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:01,439
The amount actually
we'd be willing to pay

685
00:31:01,439 --> 00:31:05,810
you make this all-in go the
other way is probably 25,000.

686
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:08,590
It's a ridiculous amount
because just the value

687
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:10,780
of having people bust
and moving up the payouts

688
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:13,420
is so significant,
especially when I'm

689
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,196
not such a big stack anymore.

690
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:22,300
OK, so now this guy,
he just doubled up.

691
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,010
So I guess we were
running pretty good.

692
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:26,857
But I'd say in the last two or
three orbits, as you can see,

693
00:31:26,857 --> 00:31:28,690
a lot of things haven't
been that favorable.

694
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:30,220
We've lost some all-ins.

695
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,710
And also people
haven't really busted.

696
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:35,620
The chips are just being
passed around the table, which

697
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:39,130
is basically not what
you're hoping for.

698
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:44,090
So king-10 offsuit.

699
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:45,134
We get a walk.

700
00:31:45,134 --> 00:31:47,050
So walk just means that
everyone folds to you,

701
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:48,000
and the big blind.

702
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,550
I think we've actually
gotten quite a lot of walks

703
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:52,380
at this final table.

704
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,150
So something we can
keep in mind if we're

705
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:58,855
trying to play exploitatively
later, queen-jack, go all in.

706
00:31:58,855 --> 00:31:59,355
He folds.

707
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:07,190
So at 8-7 I guess, LPMBox, after
winning that, so as you notice,

708
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:09,810
the big stacks are the ones
who win most of the pots.

709
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:11,390
And this is expected.

710
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:15,470
So whenever ICM is relevant,
you would expect that--

711
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:19,730
so although the small stacks had
a higher chip EV, then-- sorry,

712
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:22,430
had a higher money
EV than chip EV,

713
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:24,687
usually the chips
get transferred

714
00:32:24,687 --> 00:32:26,270
from the small stack
to the big stacks

715
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:28,670
because the big stacks
have more license

716
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:34,040
to go all in first and
bully people around.

717
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:37,520
So he takes this one down.

718
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,530
Next hand, we get jacks here.

719
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:41,600
So Panpancrisy is
actually short now even

720
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,950
though he started the final
table as the chip leader

721
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,980
because he's lost
a bunch of all-ins.

722
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,890
He gets an all-in here,
and we hold against a 6.

723
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,800
So there's actually an
interesting play here.

724
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,370
I don't think he
should have done it.

725
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:58,330
But this is actually
often a good ICM play.

726
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:02,157
So normally I would
say in this situation,

727
00:33:02,157 --> 00:33:04,240
if you have a good hand,
just go all in because he

728
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,470
knows I'm going to call.

729
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:07,450
So when ace-6, he
just went all in.

730
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:11,110
But often there's this play
called the stop-and-go, which

731
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,597
is in practice not very good.

732
00:33:12,597 --> 00:33:14,180
I don't think it
would have been here,

733
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,060
but it's an interesting
theoretical concept,

734
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:19,570
which is instead of going
on, he just calls, OK?

735
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:22,780
He calls, and then
he basically blindly

736
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:25,140
goes all in on the flop.

737
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,950
He doesn't actually
have to, but this

738
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:28,144
is what players used to do.

739
00:33:28,144 --> 00:33:29,560
And you can do
this in live poker.

740
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,143
What you would do
in this situation is

741
00:33:31,143 --> 00:33:34,020
you would say, call, and before
the dealer even deals the flop,

742
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,380
you would just say, all in.

743
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,760
And this is a legal play.

744
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,600
The point is
essentially-- it's an ICM.

745
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,340
The justification, which I
think is mostly wrong but still

746
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:50,770
interesting, is he
wants to maximize

747
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:52,150
the chances that I fold.

748
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:54,500
So essentially, OK, this
is strictly better, right?

749
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:59,170
Sorry, the fact that he would
call, let me see the flop,

750
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,570
and then I get to decide
whether to put the remaining

751
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:04,600
chips in sounds like it
should be better for me

752
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,120
than me having to put
all the chips in preflop.

753
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,620
But the main reason
why he does this

754
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:13,420
is because he wants me to have
an opportunity to fold my cards

755
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,940
and avoid getting in a
situation where both of us

756
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:18,290
are playing for
our entire stack.

757
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:20,639
So this is the
justification for it.

758
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,590
So even though you're giving
your opponent more information,

759
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:25,210
you're also
decreasing the chances

760
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:27,670
that they decide to
call to the river card

761
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:30,370
and have more chances
of beating you.

762
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:32,510
So that justification
is correct,

763
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:34,600
but it's just that if
you've crunched the numbers,

764
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,330
usually this situation
won't be favorable enough.

765
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:39,730
And usually you don't want
to be giving your opponent

766
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:42,820
that extra information.

767
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,965
OK, so finally someone busts.

768
00:34:48,166 --> 00:34:49,860
We get jacks off again.

769
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:53,520
So here normally I think I would
often consider calling this,

770
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,530
but I think just avoid-- so
now the stacks are even--

771
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:58,770
we're the chip leader
but not by a ton--

772
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:01,620
and I don't really want
to get in a big pot here.

773
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:04,156
So I decide to give it to
them, even though normally I

774
00:35:04,156 --> 00:35:05,280
would definitely call this.

775
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,200
King-7 suited.

776
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,660
I make a pretty big
all-in for 21 and 1/2 bets

777
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,090
from the small blind.

778
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:15,180
And take it down.

779
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:23,760
All right, we'll
see all the hands.

780
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,220
We fold 6-3 suited here.

781
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,890
BeMySponsor decided
to raise small, which

782
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,340
is, once again, a bit unusual.

783
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:33,030
You usually just want to go
all in in a situation where

784
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:35,000
ICM is so relevant.

785
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,250
And then Nicholas goes all in.

786
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,040
And he folds.

787
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:44,220
Jack-5 offsuit.

788
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,439
Here we fold.

789
00:35:45,439 --> 00:35:46,980
So once again, this
guy raises small.

790
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:50,940
So maybe he doesn't really
want to do this ICM thing

791
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,799
and just he wants to play pots.

792
00:35:53,799 --> 00:35:55,090
He takes that one down, though.

793
00:35:58,381 --> 00:36:00,630
Nicholas Brody-- so as you
can see, it's a bit boring.

794
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,963
There's not too many hands here.

795
00:36:01,963 --> 00:36:06,330
That's what happens with there's
ICM because you don't really

796
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,260
want to splash around.

797
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,390
You just want to survive
in the tournament

798
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:11,910
by risking all your
chips once in a while

799
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:16,980
instead of slowly bleeding your
chips in a variety of pots.

800
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:20,090
So once again, queen-9
suited, big all in.

801
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:22,390
Plenty good enough.

802
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:24,710
Queen-7 suited, I
decide to raise it up.

803
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:28,770
But unfortunately, I guess, even
if just one guy went all in,

804
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,210
I'm clearly folding.

805
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:31,650
So they both go all in.

806
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:35,340
And ace-king beats kings, which
is really bad news for everyone

807
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,300
essentially because
if kings held,

808
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,400
then he would have busted.

809
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,665
But unfortunately he doesn't.

810
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:46,544
So pocket 8s, I'm raising here.

811
00:36:46,544 --> 00:36:48,460
This would have been a
gross spot, by the way.

812
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:52,449
I think if BeMySponsor
went on here,

813
00:36:52,449 --> 00:36:53,990
I don't know what
it would have done.

814
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:57,370
it would have been very
gross because on one hand,

815
00:36:57,370 --> 00:36:59,590
I definitely don't want to
be folding a hand as good

816
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:00,860
as pocket 8s.

817
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:03,460
But on the other hand,
ICM is just so relevant,

818
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,180
I think I probably have to fold.

819
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:09,805
So yeah, this is a case where
I could've made an extreme,

820
00:37:09,805 --> 00:37:11,290
a hero fold essentially.

821
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:14,300
I folded a very good hand
if BeMySponsor went all in.

822
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:21,130
So king-jack off--
you get another walk.

823
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:28,955
OK, jack-10 off.

824
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:31,330
I'll tell you what happened,
and then we'll take a break.

825
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:32,230
And then I'll analyze it after.

826
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:34,188
This hand I want to
analyze in a bit more depth

827
00:37:34,188 --> 00:37:36,300
because I was actually
surprised going

828
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,500
through the replays looking
at how I played this.

829
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:43,180
So LPMBox makes it 16,000.

830
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:50,920
And I reraise to 44,444, so
essentially I think this--

831
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,330
I don't have a great hand.

832
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:56,080
But I think this hand is too
good not to make a bluff with.

833
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,890
So I do that.

834
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:59,470
And then he goes all in.

835
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:01,480
And then I think this
is a very tough spot

836
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,530
because my hand isn't good.

837
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:06,780
But when I reraise, I
definitely had the--

838
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,630
if this guy had
fewer chips, I would

839
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:09,880
have just went all in myself.

840
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,025
I definitely didn't
reraise to this size

841
00:38:12,025 --> 00:38:16,850
thinking I would even consider
folding if he moved on.

842
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:18,610
So yeah, the reason
I made this size

843
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:21,160
is so that if this guy
went all in, I could fold.

844
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:25,769
But as it turns out, he
folded, and he went all in.

845
00:38:25,769 --> 00:38:27,560
So let's analyze this
hand after the break.

846
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,136
We'll take a short
two-three minute break.

847
00:38:30,136 --> 00:38:31,611
OK, I'll get started again.

848
00:38:31,611 --> 00:38:33,110
So OK, so let's
calculate this hand.

849
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:36,430
So I actually decided to go
back and calculate this hand

850
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:39,820
from an ICM perspective because
ICM is basically very relevant

851
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:40,864
here.

852
00:38:40,864 --> 00:38:43,030
OK, so let's see exactly
how to do this in practice.

853
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,440
OK, so let's first do the
chip EV calculation, OK?

854
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:55,450
Let me first do the
chip EV calculation.

855
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:58,100
You can trust that I copied
the numbers correctly.

856
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,430
So essentially there's
three possibilities, OK?

857
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:03,377
There is if I fold, this
is the amount of chips.

858
00:39:03,377 --> 00:39:04,960
This is the amount
of chips I'll have.

859
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,880
OK, so right now I'm
only caring about chips.

860
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,400
So if I fold, this is the
amount of chips I'll have.

861
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,947
If I call and win, this is
the number of chips I'll have.

862
00:39:11,947 --> 00:39:14,530
And if I call and lose, this is
the amount of chips I'll have.

863
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:20,110
So we could basically do a
calculation here where I do

864
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:22,590
essentially it's-- so let's
say my chances of winning is x.

865
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:31,300
So it's x times how many chips
I have if I call and lose,

866
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,920
which is 107--

867
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,840
I'm going to not write
the last three zeros--

868
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:40,798
plus 1 minus x times 402.

869
00:39:40,798 --> 00:39:42,006
Sorry, I did this in reverse.

870
00:39:42,006 --> 00:39:44,415
OK, x is my chances of losing.

871
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:45,790
So again, I'm
basically comparing

872
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:49,810
this number versus how many
chips I have if I fold, OK?

873
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:51,880
And then essentially
I'm just solving for x.

874
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,760
So the way I do it is I
set these to be equal,

875
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,320
and then I calculate x.

876
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,600
And that's the
breakeven x, which

877
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:02,770
tells me what's the minimum
equity I need against his range

878
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:03,910
to call.

879
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:04,670
So we can do that.

880
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,440
So I think it turns out to be--

881
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:17,480
so this formula is equal to
fold minus call over-- hang on--

882
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,200
I did it before.

883
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,950
OK, so this is easy.

884
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:25,795
OK, so I Ctrl+Z, so essentially
I had 2 to 1 odds, right?

885
00:40:25,795 --> 00:40:27,590
I had 2 to 1 odds,
so it makes sense

886
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:31,370
that I needed a 33% equity call.

887
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:32,945
OK, so how do we do this side?

888
00:40:32,945 --> 00:40:35,180
These are essentially
the ICM numbers.

889
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,680
So essentially the
way you calculate

890
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:42,380
this is you Google
ICM calculator,

891
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,360
and then you just
go to the first one.

892
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,920
It's usually quite easy to find.

893
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,840
OK, so it's a bit
tricky because you have

894
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,450
to put in the exact payouts.

895
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:53,720
So I think at the
time they were 18.5.

896
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,040
This is all as a percentage
of the total pot.

897
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:00,680
So I forget exactly the numbers,
but it was something like this.

898
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,740
OK, and then you type
in the four-- you type

899
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:03,870
in the stack sizes.

900
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:06,260
So it takes a bit
of time and even

901
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:09,560
if you're fast at this, if
you conserve your entire time

902
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,424
bank from the whole tournament
for this one calculation,

903
00:41:12,424 --> 00:41:14,090
you'd probably have
enough time to do it

904
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:17,330
because you'll probably have
like two or three minutes

905
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:18,690
of time bank saved up.

906
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:19,850
So you probably can do it.

907
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:21,379
You have to essentially, right?

908
00:41:21,379 --> 00:41:22,670
So there's three possibilities.

909
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:26,159
I have to calculate if I fold,
not only how many chips I have

910
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:27,700
but how many chips
everyone else has.

911
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,825
And then I take them in,
and then I can essentially

912
00:41:29,825 --> 00:41:33,200
calculate the value of my
stack in terms of as a fraction

913
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,760
of the total money in the pot.

914
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,580
And then similarly, I do
it for the other two cases.

915
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:39,320
And then I calculate
the ICM numbers.

916
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,680
And roughly speaking,
this is my--

917
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,370
this is all normalized.

918
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:52,590
This is roughly my dollar EV in
each of these three scenarios.

919
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:54,540
If I do the same
calculation, I'll

920
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:59,480
find that I actually
need 39.6 equity.

921
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,760
So far does the calculation
make sense to everyone?

922
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,380
I didn't do all the
steps in practice,

923
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:05,300
but I explained how
to do all the steps.

924
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,340
Yeah, if you're
fast, it still takes

925
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,270
like a minute-a minute and 1/2.

926
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:12,652
But the last part is now we
have to open Poker [INAUDIBLE]..

927
00:42:12,652 --> 00:42:15,440
And now we have to type
in jack-10 offsuit.

928
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,450
And then we have to
put him on the range.

929
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:21,280
So OK, let's just put him on a--

930
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,450
OK, I suspect that
I'm probably going

931
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:30,940
to have to fold because
39.6% is quite a lot.

932
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:36,170
I'm going to put him on the
loosest range and see a 539.6.

933
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:37,810
So let's say he's pretty loose.

934
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:42,290
So he's willing to gamble with,
let's say, pocket 4s plus--

935
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:44,840
I mean, another
thing that's relevant

936
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:48,920
here is I think it looks like
he doesn't have fold equity.

937
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,260
I don't think when
he's going all in here

938
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:53,390
he suspects that
I'm ever folding.

939
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:55,010
Or at least he
probably thinks I'm

940
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:58,170
calling him the overwhelming
majority of the time.

941
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:01,550
So I think he's rarely going to
turn up a stone bluff like 8-7

942
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:04,820
suited because of this.

943
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,320
I would be very
surprised if he ever

944
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:10,970
had 8-7 suited unless
he read into this

945
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:14,510
and realized that I could
actually fold some hands here,

946
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:16,390
which maybe he did.

947
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:19,380
I should give him enough credit.

948
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:21,180
OK, let's just do
something somewhat quick.

949
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:25,160
Let's say he gets ace-8
offsuit, ace-5 suited

950
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:28,030
plus, king-jack suited,
king-queen off, and pocket

951
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:29,100
4s plus.

952
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:31,920
So that's 14.6% of hands.

953
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,260
So let's do this.

954
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:36,736
So against this we
have 36% equity.

955
00:43:36,736 --> 00:43:37,610
So that's not enough.

956
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:39,110
We need 39.

957
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:42,260
Let's see how wide his range
has to be for us to have 39.

958
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:45,410
All right, let's say he
gets in with 20% of hands,

959
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:49,316
which is quite a lot, which
is, I think, way too much.

960
00:43:49,316 --> 00:43:53,490
Let's say 18.6 percent of hands.

961
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:55,550
Oh, we actually have
worse against this range

962
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:58,174
because it has-- oops-- because
it has more hands that dominate

963
00:43:58,174 --> 00:44:00,630
us because I put in a
lot of hands like king-10

964
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:02,990
and removed a lot of
the hands like ace-4.

965
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:07,000
So basically OK, you can play
with it however you want.

966
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,530
But I think it's hard
to play with it in a way

967
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:13,350
to give yourself 39%
equity unless you

968
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:16,970
were very optimistic about
how wide his range was.

969
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:20,510
So in either case, so
at the time I did fold.

970
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:23,240
And it looks weird to me at
first, but after analyzing it,

971
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,400
I think this is
definitely the right play

972
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,530
if you take into account ICM.

973
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:29,900
So I think it's a
good example of ICM

974
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:33,260
because if you remember when
we were playing with it,

975
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:38,510
our equity was always
essentially between 33 and 39.

976
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:42,080
If we put them on a looser
range, our equity would be 37.

977
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:45,110
And if we put them on a tighter
ranger, our equity would be 34.

978
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:48,920
But basically it's a
situation where I would always

979
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:52,820
call if ICM was not
relevant and always fold

980
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:55,640
if ICM was relevant.

981
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,980
And this isn't even a case
where it looks like ICM

982
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:00,315
should be that relevant.

983
00:45:00,315 --> 00:45:01,550
Yeah, so we do fold.

984
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:04,740
So with hindsight, maybe my
initial strategy was wrong.

985
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:07,070
Maybe I should have should
not have even bluffed here.

986
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:09,250
Maybe I should have just
folded in the first place.

987
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:10,291
That's a different story.

988
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:12,569
But given that I
did bluff, I think

989
00:45:12,569 --> 00:45:14,110
the best thing I
can do here is fold.

990
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:20,970
OK, let me just jump back
to the PowerPoint for a bit.

991
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:22,620
So I just want to
talk about a bit more

992
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:26,700
about this theory of satellites
and going all in first.

993
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:30,435
So in game theory, this is
called the traffic intersection

994
00:45:30,435 --> 00:45:31,230
game.

995
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:34,200
So ICM does not
say, play tighter.

996
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:37,140
It allows you to play looser
if you can go all in first.

997
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:39,060
So this is where
I actually think

998
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:41,430
it's very interesting
because in satellites, you

999
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:42,870
want to be under the gun.

1000
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:45,530
So normally in poker, that's the
worst position because you've

1001
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:46,770
got to act first.

1002
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:49,260
Everyone else gets
to act after you.

1003
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,420
But in satellites,
basically you just

1004
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:54,600
want to be the first person to
be able to threaten, say, look,

1005
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,890
I'm putting all my chips in.

1006
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:58,320
You pretty much have to fold.

1007
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:01,260
So in satellites, let's
say there's 11 people left,

1008
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:02,780
and 10 people get a seat.

1009
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:04,680
If you go on, no
one can call you

1010
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:08,760
even if they have aces
because to call you,

1011
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,920
they essentially need
to be more than 10/11

1012
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,854
sure that they're
going to win the hand.

1013
00:46:12,854 --> 00:46:14,270
And even if they
have pocket aces,

1014
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:16,410
they're not going to be
10/11 sure that they're

1015
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:17,460
going to win the hand.

1016
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:22,880
So basically going all in
first is very, very good.

1017
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,930
So it's called the
traffic interception game

1018
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:26,880
because you can imagine
the situation where

1019
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,420
there's two cars trying to pass
each other at an intersection.

1020
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:34,200
And you want to save
time, get there first.

1021
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,140
But you're worried that
the other guy might crash.

1022
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:38,932
Both players really
want to avoid disaster,

1023
00:46:38,932 --> 00:46:40,681
but both players really
want to be the guy

1024
00:46:40,681 --> 00:46:41,710
to get through first.

1025
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:44,850
Well, if you can act first, and
if you just tell the guy, look,

1026
00:46:44,850 --> 00:46:46,650
I'm closing my eyes.

1027
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:47,640
I'm tying up my hands.

1028
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:50,110
I cannot stop my car, OK?

1029
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:52,770
I'm just going to go through
the intersection no matter what.

1030
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:55,050
If you're the first person
to be able to do this, then

1031
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:56,880
the other guy, he's
like, OK, I guess

1032
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,250
I've got to stop my car
now and let you go first.

1033
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:00,960
That's essentially
what it's like.

1034
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,870
If you're the first person to go
all in and you've already said,

1035
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:05,700
look, I'm all in,
and there's nothing

1036
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:08,599
I can do to take my chips back,
then the other guy is like,

1037
00:47:08,599 --> 00:47:09,890
all right, I guess I'll follow.

1038
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:11,220
And you can win the blinds.

1039
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:13,290
So it's sort of how it works.

1040
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:15,520
Of course, some opponents
are not rational.

1041
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,952
If you do this
enough times, they

1042
00:47:16,952 --> 00:47:18,690
might be like, OK, screw this.

1043
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:22,220
I'm just going to kill
this guy and speed up.

1044
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:25,481
So it's a bit weird, and in
practice, this happens a lot,

1045
00:47:25,481 --> 00:47:25,980
too.

1046
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:29,100
I've definitely had very
bad situations where

1047
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:31,440
I'm going all in
with any two cards,

1048
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,770
and I know this is a game
theoretically optimal strategy.

1049
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:36,810
But my opponents are sped up.

1050
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:39,910
And then he calls me with
ace-jack or something.

1051
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:41,410
And then I'll have
jack-2 offsuited.

1052
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:43,201
And he looks like a
genius, and he beats me

1053
00:47:43,201 --> 00:47:45,262
when his play is just
terrible basically.

1054
00:47:45,262 --> 00:47:45,762
Yeah?

1055
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:47,053
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so interesting.

1056
00:47:47,053 --> 00:47:49,590
So does it matter if,
say, you're under the gun,

1057
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:50,976
and you're in the low stack.

1058
00:47:50,976 --> 00:47:52,085
Can you do this?

1059
00:47:52,085 --> 00:47:52,710
WILL MA: Right.

1060
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:53,960
So the stack size does matter.

1061
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:56,190
So I'm assuming if everyone
had the same stack size

1062
00:47:56,190 --> 00:47:58,350
in that extreme
example, where I said

1063
00:47:58,350 --> 00:47:59,910
other people should
fold aces, I'm

1064
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:01,890
assuming everyone has
the same stack size.

1065
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:05,150
AUDIENCE: I guess where's the
balance between knocking you

1066
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:07,850
out versus the
chips differential?

1067
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:09,300
WILL MA: Right, exactly.

1068
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:10,680
So the reason, in
that case where

1069
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:13,510
it's correct to fold
aces, is because let's say

1070
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:15,150
they call and knock me out.

1071
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:18,090
It doesn't help them that
much because first place

1072
00:48:18,090 --> 00:48:22,320
in a satellite does not get
paid any more than 10th place.

1073
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,375
But in real tournaments,
you basically

1074
00:48:24,375 --> 00:48:27,410
never fold aces
because even if you're

1075
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:30,040
risking losing all your
money, just first place

1076
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,150
will be hire than
second place by enough.

1077
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:34,830
And winning with those aces
will increases your chances

1078
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:38,740
of coming first by so much that
you should just gamble anyway.

1079
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:40,030
So this is only in satellites.

1080
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:44,479
Yeah, please don't fold aces in
like a normal poker tournament.

1081
00:48:44,479 --> 00:48:44,978
Yeah?

1082
00:48:44,978 --> 00:48:47,705
AUDIENCE: If you're a short
stack in a satellite or one

1083
00:48:47,705 --> 00:48:51,120
of the shorter stacks, does
going all in still make sense?

1084
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:54,530
Because people can call you
without risking a tournament.

1085
00:48:54,530 --> 00:48:55,530
WILL MA: Right, exactly.

1086
00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:58,380
So in that case, you actually
need a good had to go all in.

1087
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:00,250
You actually need to
have positive chip EV

1088
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:01,500
as well to go all in.

1089
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:05,440
Yeah, so that's why when ICM is
relevant, the small stacks win.

1090
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,322
And the big-- sorry,
the small stacks lose.

1091
00:49:07,322 --> 00:49:08,280
And the big stacks win.

1092
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,140
Because the big stacks
have more license

1093
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:14,850
to bully small sacks around,
whereas the small stacks can't

1094
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:16,995
because the big stacks can
call at them more often.

1095
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:20,250
AUDIENCE: And also does it
matter if other people have

1096
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:21,810
raised behind you?

1097
00:49:21,810 --> 00:49:25,026
Does it just matter
who goes all in first?

1098
00:49:25,026 --> 00:49:27,690
WILL MA: So if someone's
already raised,

1099
00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:31,170
then it's more likely
you going all in--

1100
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:32,790
it's more likely
they are already

1101
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:35,920
committed so that if you
go all in, they won't fold.

1102
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,354
So that is relevant, yeah.

1103
00:49:38,354 --> 00:49:41,470
OK, and cool.

1104
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:42,570
Right, so exactly.

1105
00:49:42,570 --> 00:49:44,140
So in practice,
it's very tricky.

1106
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:45,515
And in fact, it
can be beneficial

1107
00:49:45,515 --> 00:49:47,931
if you can somehow convince
your opponents that you're not

1108
00:49:47,931 --> 00:49:48,570
rational.

1109
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:50,278
I've never personally
done this, but I've

1110
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:53,340
heard of people making a bad
call sometimes in a satellite

1111
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:56,600
just so people know not to
mess with him essentially.

1112
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,340
But I mean it's a bit weird.

1113
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:01,500
There is this weird
metagame with this traffic

1114
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,660
intersection-type
game, although this

1115
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:07,050
is only relevant in the most
extreme ICM situations, which

1116
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:10,670
are satellites.

1117
00:50:10,670 --> 00:50:12,570
Actually, I should
say, one scenario

1118
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:15,300
where I think you could
consider folding aces

1119
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:18,850
preflop in a normal
tournament is actually this.

1120
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:20,780
Let's say there's 55 until--

1121
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:23,070
let's say 54 get paid.

1122
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:24,290
And there's 55 left.

1123
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:26,045
And you've got one
chip, and everyone else

1124
00:50:26,045 --> 00:50:27,440
has thousands of chips.

1125
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,754
And you know that
someone else has already

1126
00:50:29,754 --> 00:50:30,920
gotten eliminated that hand.

1127
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:33,920
So if you fold, you're
guaranteed to get in the money.

1128
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,750
Then I would
definitely fold aces

1129
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:38,450
because even if you win in
double up, congratulations,

1130
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:40,790
you now have 10 chips
instead of one chip.

1131
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:43,160
Everyone still has
thousands of chips.

1132
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:46,400
There are cases where you could
construct an extreme case where

1133
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,510
you should fold aces
preflop in a tournament,

1134
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:51,601
in a normal tournament as well.

1135
00:50:51,601 --> 00:50:56,260
OK, so let's get back
to the tournament now.

1136
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:57,500
OK, where were we?

1137
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:01,730
So we lost a bunch
of chips here.

1138
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:05,205
So the next hand we
get king-8 offsuit.

1139
00:51:05,205 --> 00:51:07,880
I raise from the button.

1140
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:09,390
So we are committed here.

1141
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:12,410
It sucks because our hand
sucks, but it's way too

1142
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:14,180
good odds to call.

1143
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:16,060
And ICM is nowhere
near that relevant

1144
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:17,870
when it's against
the small stack.

1145
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:19,710
It's the guy you're
trying to eliminate.

1146
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:20,210
So we call.

1147
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:23,540
We get pretty lucky here.

1148
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:27,140
Good redemption for that
terrible jack-10 hand

1149
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:27,830
played by me.

1150
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:30,320
OK, so there's
three players left.

1151
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,300
So ICM is still very relevant.

1152
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,820
We're the second stack.

1153
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:38,420
So we're trying not to get in
a big all-in with this guy,

1154
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:42,020
although it's less significant
because this guy still

1155
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:43,400
has a decent amount of chips.

1156
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,290
If this guy only
had 50,000 chips,

1157
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:47,930
then I would try a lot
harder to avoid getting

1158
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:51,080
in a big pot with BeMySponsor.

1159
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,260
So-- oops.

1160
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:56,100
So yeah, so he raises,
and LPMBox goes all in,

1161
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:56,960
takes it down.

1162
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:03,230
So this hand, he makes it 3x.

1163
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:07,250
And I decide to call it here
with queen-6 suited, which

1164
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:08,450
is gutsy I think.

1165
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:11,810
But I think it's in position,
and it's fairly deep.

1166
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:14,967
And being able to put ICM
pressure on him is reasonable.

1167
00:52:14,967 --> 00:52:16,550
I think it could
have gone either way.

1168
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,510
Folding is definitely
the safer play,

1169
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:24,890
but queen-6 suited is
plenty good enough here.

1170
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:25,910
So I call.

1171
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:27,334
He just checks.

1172
00:52:27,334 --> 00:52:29,000
He might just be
giving up on this board

1173
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,150
where there's a decent amount
of-- it's fairly dry, right?

1174
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:35,245
So from what I said last class,
if the board is fairly dry,

1175
00:52:35,245 --> 00:52:38,360
where every hand has something,
if you've got absolutely

1176
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:40,310
nothing, then
there's not even much

1177
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:43,910
point to make a bluff like if
he's got ace-2 offsuit here.

1178
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:47,030
So he just checks in,
and I bet, and he folds.

1179
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:51,710
So he probably had ace-2
offsuit some hand like that.

1180
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,800
Next hand we get ace-king.

1181
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:56,090
I decide to raise
small here once again.

1182
00:52:56,090 --> 00:53:00,680
So I guess this protects
that jack-10 hand.

1183
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,180
If I'm doing this
with jack-10, I

1184
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:04,970
do need to do it with good
hands as well to protect

1185
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:07,520
the times I do have jack-10.

1186
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,630
Unfortunately, he
guesses correctly.

1187
00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:11,560
He doesn't fold, and I
have jack-10 and folds.

1188
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:12,393
And I have ace-king.

1189
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:16,400
So he still take that one downs.

1190
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,890
And we win the blinds
the next hand again.

1191
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:22,730
So suddenly we're worried
chip leader by a decent margin

1192
00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:25,430
after those three hands.

1193
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:30,730
9-4 off-- I'm not going
to call, so fold to him.

1194
00:53:30,730 --> 00:53:33,060
So jack-7, so once
again, because of ICM,

1195
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:35,690
this guy just goes all in
knowing we can't call that

1196
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:36,670
much.

1197
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:39,210
Takes it down.

1198
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:41,570
7-6 offsuit, I decide to fold.

1199
00:53:41,570 --> 00:53:44,450
I think that's very reasonable
considering they can just

1200
00:53:44,450 --> 00:53:45,650
go all in on top of that.

1201
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:50,830
Queen-9, queen-9
off, get a walk.

1202
00:53:50,830 --> 00:53:52,330
So one thing I
should pay attention

1203
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:54,340
is I do think these guys--

1204
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:56,680
by now I've collected
enough data points

1205
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:59,180
of getting a walk way
more often than I should,

1206
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:01,790
where I think it's not
just a coincidence.

1207
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:05,200
I'm statistically confident
enough that they're actually

1208
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,610
just giving me too many walks.

1209
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:09,120
So when they don't
give me a walk,

1210
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,470
I should put them on a
stronger range of hands

1211
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:14,080
than I normally do.

1212
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:16,080
Pocket 10s, we three-bet
this guy again.

1213
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,110
He gets away again.

1214
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:22,317
So 6-2 off, so we've
gotten dealt good cards

1215
00:54:22,317 --> 00:54:24,650
even though we haven't gotten
too much action from them.

1216
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:28,000
We're still winning by two
chips from getting good cards.

1217
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:33,120
So jack-4 off, I'm going
to fold to this guy.

1218
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,930
So as you can see,
it's fairly boring,

1219
00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:38,860
but I think this
is what essentially

1220
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:43,000
should happen in the
final couple of people

1221
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,280
left in the tournament.

1222
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:50,860
Ace-10 off, so I decide
to not go all in here.

1223
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:52,915
I guess that would be 27 big--

1224
00:54:52,915 --> 00:54:56,420
26 and a 1/2 big blinds,
which is a bit much.

1225
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:59,650
So I decided to
just raise small.

1226
00:54:59,650 --> 00:55:03,460
If he three-bets, if he
reraises to, say, 60,000,

1227
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:05,680
I'm always going all in here.

1228
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:10,540
If he goes all in himself,
I'm basically not folding

1229
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:13,417
even though it sucks from
an ICM point of view.

1230
00:55:13,417 --> 00:55:15,250
I think ace-10 offsuit
is just way too good.

1231
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:19,330
So I'm essentially just raising
small looking for action here.

1232
00:55:19,330 --> 00:55:19,960
He folds.

1233
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,540
7-2 offsuit, we raise-- no.

1234
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:27,050
[LAUGHTER]

1235
00:55:27,050 --> 00:55:31,820
So LPMBox gets a walk.

1236
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:34,620
Queen-3 off, we get another
walk, which is nice.

1237
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:42,630
Jack-5 off, I raise
here, which is definitely

1238
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:43,930
an exploitative play.

1239
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:47,950
It's definitely not-- definitely
from a Nash equilibrium optimal

1240
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:50,890
play point of view,
there's no way

1241
00:55:50,890 --> 00:55:53,780
the optimal strategy is to
raise a fraction of hand

1242
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:56,320
so big that it includes
jack-5 offsuit.

1243
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:59,200
But I think at the
time, I probably

1244
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,985
told myself, this guy
was being overly scared.

1245
00:56:01,985 --> 00:56:04,450
Even though he was playing
somewhat aggressive earlier on,

1246
00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:07,870
he is maybe
overadjusting for ICM

1247
00:56:07,870 --> 00:56:10,420
and is respecting me
too much in the presence

1248
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:12,610
of this short stack.

1249
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:14,800
I can look at the HUD
stats at the time,

1250
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:18,580
although they won't be that
accurate because they're

1251
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:20,920
going to include all the hands.

1252
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:24,460
So normally I do play
with all these numbers on.

1253
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:26,270
So we can see that his--

1254
00:56:26,270 --> 00:56:28,090
yeah, but it's
going to be biased

1255
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:31,870
because this includes
the hands with six

1256
00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:33,490
or seven people at the table.

1257
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:38,860
But it says that he calls
from the big blind only 20%

1258
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:39,370
of the time.

1259
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:41,882
But that's not a great--

1260
00:56:41,882 --> 00:56:43,090
yeah, that's going to biased.

1261
00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:46,870
So it doesn't tell us too much.

1262
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:48,929
But I guess at the time,
I must have told myself

1263
00:56:48,929 --> 00:56:50,470
I'm going to try to
exploit this guy.

1264
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:53,080
That's the only way I
can see why I decided

1265
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,810
to raise jack-5 offsuit here.

1266
00:56:55,810 --> 00:56:56,740
So we get a call.

1267
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:59,170
But I'm going to
continuation bet.

1268
00:56:59,170 --> 00:57:01,300
We do have a
backdoor heart draw,

1269
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:04,300
and this is our best chance
of just winning the pot.

1270
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:06,970
And I could maybe barrel on--

1271
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:10,790
by barrel, I mean bet again as
a bluff on a bunch of turns.

1272
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:13,110
So I just bet here.

1273
00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:13,780
He does fold.

1274
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:19,870
Next hand with queen-9,
we open the button,

1275
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:21,760
but we get shoved on.

1276
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,440
And I guess we have to fold.

1277
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:29,010
Queen-4, we get another walk.

1278
00:57:29,010 --> 00:57:30,843
Yes, so this is actually
getting ridiculous.

1279
00:57:30,843 --> 00:57:32,950
It seems like we've
literally gotten

1280
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:34,510
five or six walks in a row.

1281
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:40,000
And I would guess probably we
should be getting a walk less--

1282
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,940
I guess at a three-handed
table, it's more often but still

1283
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:45,282
less than like 30% of the time.

1284
00:57:45,282 --> 00:57:45,781
Yeah?

1285
00:57:45,781 --> 00:57:47,406
AUDIENCE: Is it
possible you're getting

1286
00:57:47,406 --> 00:57:51,030
walks because someone
has raised your big blind

1287
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:52,640
and you defended a lot?

1288
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:55,005
And so they're scared
to raise your big blind?

1289
00:57:55,005 --> 00:57:55,630
WILL MA: Maybe.

1290
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:57,520
I have been fairly active.

1291
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:58,960
But I did fold a bunch of--

1292
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:02,350
I did fold some borderline
situations, though,

1293
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:03,424
like this jack--

1294
00:58:03,424 --> 00:58:04,840
I think it was a
different jack-7.

1295
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:06,814
But yeah, maybe.

1296
00:58:06,814 --> 00:58:07,480
That's possibly.

1297
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,826
Yeah, very good point.

1298
00:58:09,826 --> 00:58:10,805
But that's good, right?

1299
00:58:10,805 --> 00:58:11,930
It's good that we're like--

1300
00:58:11,930 --> 00:58:16,640
I'm not complaining that
we're getting a lot of stuff.

1301
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:20,470
And we are the big stack, so in
general, it is harder for them

1302
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:22,810
to bully us around than
us to bully them around.

1303
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:25,870
So it does make sense from
that point of view, too.

1304
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:27,905
I saw that it was just too many.

1305
00:58:27,905 --> 00:58:29,280
Anyway, so I just
continue trying

1306
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:32,230
to raise a lot, especially
against this guy.

1307
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:35,420
So jack-8 offsuit,
we take it down.

1308
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:37,420
Jack-2, maybe we
could have folded.

1309
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:39,940
But by now this guy was
getting short enough.

1310
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:42,760
He's blinded down from
15 and 1/2 big blinds,

1311
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,530
I think, to 13 and 1/2.

1312
00:58:44,530 --> 00:58:46,570
He might have had
more before, like 17.

1313
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:50,260
So he might be looking
for a spot to shove now.

1314
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:52,170
BeMySponsor actually
raises a small here

1315
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:53,710
and gets him to fold.

1316
00:58:57,895 --> 00:59:00,200
And jack-6 off here.

1317
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:01,040
We get another walk.

1318
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,790
I should just skip the
hands on big blinds

1319
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:07,660
since nothing ever happens,
which is great for us.

1320
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:10,810
So pocket 3s here,
I just go all in.

1321
00:59:10,810 --> 00:59:14,700
So I talked about this before.

1322
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:17,470
What's a problem with what
this play in some sense?

1323
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:23,800
AUDIENCE: Reverse implied odds?

1324
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:24,860
WILL MA: Right, good.

1325
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:27,900
So yeah, so if I don't do
this, if I just raise small,

1326
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:30,890
I have bad reverse
implied odds, right?

1327
00:59:30,890 --> 00:59:34,140
But one particular issue
is every other time

1328
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:35,910
we've made it 25,000.

1329
00:59:35,910 --> 00:59:38,820
And really nothing's changed,
and suddenly we go all in.

1330
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:42,800
So it is a bit suspicious
where he basically

1331
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:46,440
knows we have a hand that has
very bad reverse implied odds.

1332
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:49,680
He basically knows we have
pocket 3s or ace-4 offsuit

1333
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:50,640
or something like that.

1334
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:54,240
But it's still hard
for him to exploit.

1335
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:57,570
I mean sure, you can call
ace-9 and exploit us,

1336
00:59:57,570 --> 01:00:00,090
but ace-9 is already
a great hand.

1337
01:00:00,090 --> 01:00:02,370
Or you can call pocket
4s and exploit us,

1338
01:00:02,370 --> 01:00:06,000
but it's not that easy to get
dealt pocket 4s or a better

1339
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,970
pair than pocket 4s.

1340
01:00:07,970 --> 01:00:13,160
So here yeah, even though
against a good player, he knows

1341
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,990
my range is a very small
specific number of hands.

1342
01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:17,630
It's still hard for him to--

1343
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:20,080
he can't really just
call jack-10 suited here.

1344
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:24,200
Maybe he can, but probably
jack-9 suited or queen-7

1345
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:27,810
suited he can't call
because there's still

1346
01:00:27,810 --> 01:00:31,491
an off chance we have
queen-9 offsuit or something.

1347
01:00:31,491 --> 01:00:32,750
Oops.

1348
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:35,280
So anyway, so he does fold.

1349
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,180
But it definitely
raises suspicion.

1350
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:42,415
Jack-10 off, so jack-10
off, we just go all in here.

1351
01:00:42,415 --> 01:00:44,410
So this is actually important.

1352
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:46,770
So normally I would just
raise from the button,

1353
01:00:46,770 --> 01:00:49,020
but by now, the big
blind has gotten

1354
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,870
so short that I'm
willing to just go

1355
01:00:51,870 --> 01:00:55,350
all in because the big blind is
short enough where even if he

1356
01:00:55,350 --> 01:00:57,450
picks up a hand and
calls and beats me,

1357
01:00:57,450 --> 01:00:59,890
I'm still the chip leader,
even if that happens.

1358
01:00:59,890 --> 01:01:03,880
So the ICM doesn't hurt
me that much because--

1359
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:07,860
yeah, and also just the
fact that I'm risking less.

1360
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:10,500
The other important thing of
the big blind getting short

1361
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:14,160
is now the small blind is much
less incentivized to gamble

1362
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,240
than before.

1363
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:18,840
Before, when the
big blind had 180K,

1364
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:21,120
he was incentivizing
gambling against me

1365
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:25,530
because it's not that easy to
wait for the big blind to bust.

1366
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:27,870
But now that the big
blind only has 10K,

1367
01:01:27,870 --> 01:01:30,630
it's easier to just wait
and hope that he busts.

1368
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:34,710
So basically ICM becomes a lot
more favorable in both cases.

1369
01:01:34,710 --> 01:01:39,060
And shoving, I think, is very
good now with the stack sizes.

1370
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:42,600
So we do shove, and
we take it down.

1371
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:45,690
9-2 off, so no one
usually wants our blinds,

1372
01:01:45,690 --> 01:01:48,410
but then they both
want our blinds.

1373
01:01:48,410 --> 01:01:49,760
LPMBox takes it down.

1374
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:56,240
So ace-2, I just go all in here.

1375
01:01:56,240 --> 01:02:00,120
Basically same justification
as the pocket 3s.

1376
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:05,210
8-7 off, I think I probably
should have raised this.

1377
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:08,480
Even going all in honestly
might not be that bad.

1378
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:09,980
I'd have to do an
exact calculation,

1379
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:12,140
but I think probably--

1380
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:13,130
it's a pretty bad hand.

1381
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:16,010
But I think probably I
shouldn't be folding given

1382
01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:18,440
that I'm the big stack and
given that they've both

1383
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:20,240
been giving me lots of respect.

1384
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,950
But I fold, which
can be a big mistake.

1385
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:26,500
But I think probably I
shouldn't have folded.

1386
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:29,370
The next hand, LPMBox
goes all in, and we fold.

1387
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:37,150
Next hand, we 8-7
suited, so by now,

1388
01:02:37,150 --> 01:02:40,080
this guy, BeMySponsor,
so we've just won enough

1389
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:42,610
pots where this guy
is also short now.

1390
01:02:42,610 --> 01:02:45,590
So it's a pretty good situation
for us from an ICM perspective.

1391
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:48,910
They're both short enough where
we can just go all in preflop

1392
01:02:48,910 --> 01:02:53,110
very often and they have
to fold quite often.

1393
01:02:53,110 --> 01:02:55,780
10-7 off is a bit too weak,
but I decide to raise.

1394
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:58,030
But yeah, this is a bit
inconsistent play from my part

1395
01:02:58,030 --> 01:03:00,480
because I think
for most purposes,

1396
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:03,470
8-7 off is a better
hand than 10-7 off.

1397
01:03:03,470 --> 01:03:09,070
But for some reason I raise
10-7 off and fold 8-7 off.

1398
01:03:09,070 --> 01:03:10,960
He's 5-suited.

1399
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,150
We get a walk again.

1400
01:03:13,150 --> 01:03:16,780
Queen-5 off, yeah, so
I just go all in here.

1401
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:19,930
So this is definitely not
a plus chip EV all-in,

1402
01:03:19,930 --> 01:03:22,450
but once again I
think ICM by now

1403
01:03:22,450 --> 01:03:26,500
is relevant enough where
it's fine because he just

1404
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:31,070
has to fold, weakening it down.

1405
01:03:31,070 --> 01:03:33,610
10-6 off, I decide to fold.

1406
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:35,950
Big blind gets a walk.

1407
01:03:35,950 --> 01:03:39,380
Get a walk with
6-deuce pretty good.

1408
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:41,070
Ace-2 off, once
again, we go all in.

1409
01:03:41,070 --> 01:03:42,560
They fold.

1410
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:44,300
Pocket kings, so I basically--

1411
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:44,929
AUDIENCE: Wow.

1412
01:03:44,929 --> 01:03:46,970
WILL MA: Yeah, so this is
a bit suspicious again.

1413
01:03:46,970 --> 01:03:48,850
Normally I've been going all in.

1414
01:03:48,850 --> 01:03:49,530
He raises small.

1415
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:52,670
Obviously yes, pocket kings.

1416
01:03:52,670 --> 01:03:54,740
So yeah, that's basically true.

1417
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:56,630
But I mean also I
think I will do this

1418
01:03:56,630 --> 01:03:58,880
with some of the
weakest hands that I'm

1419
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,800
not willing to
gamble all in with

1420
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:05,600
but still want to raise maybe
something like 9-7 offsuit

1421
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:07,220
maybe.

1422
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:12,170
But we don't play it,
so we take it down.

1423
01:04:12,170 --> 01:04:13,040
So he goes all in.

1424
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:14,110
We fold jack-2 offsuit.

1425
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:18,627
Queen-3 suited, go all in.

1426
01:04:18,627 --> 01:04:20,460
So I'm going to go
through this fairly fast.

1427
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:22,310
There's a lot of same stuff.

1428
01:04:22,310 --> 01:04:26,895
6-5 off, we fold because
yeah, by now they're

1429
01:04:26,895 --> 01:04:29,020
short enough where they
might actually just call us

1430
01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:30,310
pretty often.

1431
01:04:30,310 --> 01:04:32,830
So I fold 6-5 off.

1432
01:04:32,830 --> 01:04:36,430
So here, pocket 3s holds
against queen-jack.

1433
01:04:36,430 --> 01:04:39,250
So this is an extreme ICM spot.

1434
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:42,010
So he calls here, and
he does double up.

1435
01:04:42,010 --> 01:04:46,120
So the next hand, we do
have an extreme ICM spot

1436
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:48,970
because this guy only
has one big blind.

1437
01:04:48,970 --> 01:04:50,770
So essentially their
correct strategy

1438
01:04:50,770 --> 01:04:53,290
is going to be I'm supposed
to shove any two cards.

1439
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:56,590
And he's only supposed
to call, I would guess,

1440
01:04:56,590 --> 01:05:02,080
maybe the top 7% or 8%
of hands in a situation.

1441
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:05,410
He normally should be
calling top 30 or something.

1442
01:05:05,410 --> 01:05:07,380
So I just go all in.

1443
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:11,660
Even if he has ace-2 offsuit,
I'm certain he has to fold.

1444
01:05:11,660 --> 01:05:15,520
Even if he has, say, king-queen,
and I turn up my hand

1445
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,335
and show him jack-8,
he probably still

1446
01:05:17,335 --> 01:05:23,275
has to fold just because
he really can't bust.

1447
01:05:23,275 --> 01:05:25,570
I haven't done the
exact math, but I

1448
01:05:25,570 --> 01:05:27,520
wouldn't be that
surprised if he told me

1449
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:29,140
pocket 9s is a fold for him.

1450
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:32,100
I wouldn't be that
surprised, so yeah.

1451
01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:39,160
So once again, I go all in
because this guy probably

1452
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:39,850
can't call.

1453
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:46,440
Oh, OK, so yeah.

1454
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:48,927
We win against
ace-queen, which is crazy

1455
01:05:48,927 --> 01:05:51,260
that they picked up ace-queen
with one big blind, right?

1456
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:51,760
Anyway.

1457
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:52,530
[LAUGHTER]

1458
01:05:53,130 --> 01:05:57,720
Some players like to do this
thing called cooperative play

1459
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:01,350
to get that big blind to bust.

1460
01:06:01,350 --> 01:06:04,470
In the history of
poker, it's what

1461
01:06:04,470 --> 01:06:09,620
was almost customary for the
players who have chips in here

1462
01:06:09,620 --> 01:06:12,660
to basically just all agree
to just call and not raise

1463
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:16,140
each other and to maximize
their chances of busting

1464
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:17,117
the big blind.

1465
01:06:17,117 --> 01:06:18,700
It's a form of
cheating in some sense.

1466
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:20,320
It's collusion in some sense.

1467
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:23,930
But it's customary maybe
five-six years ago for everyone

1468
01:06:23,930 --> 01:06:28,140
to do this because it
benefits everyone else.

1469
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:33,150
It benefits all of these guys
if they all agree to do this.

1470
01:06:33,150 --> 01:06:35,760
And it just
maximizes the chances

1471
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,650
that the big blind
is eliminated.

1472
01:06:37,650 --> 01:06:43,950
But the issue with
this is unfortunately

1473
01:06:43,950 --> 01:06:46,170
there is an option
to be selfish.

1474
01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:50,640
Unfortunately, if we both
trusted each other completely,

1475
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:53,760
we could collude and be like,
OK, we're just going to call,

1476
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,250
check down every flop
turn and river no matter

1477
01:06:56,250 --> 01:06:59,160
what to match so that we can
both see the river with any two

1478
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:02,010
cards and maximize the
chances of busting this guy.

1479
01:07:02,010 --> 01:07:09,180
The issue with this is when you
play a game, you're selfish.

1480
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:10,950
If there is an
opportunity to bet

1481
01:07:10,950 --> 01:07:14,469
because you have a good hand,
you're going to want to bet.

1482
01:07:14,469 --> 01:07:16,260
If there's a draw and
you have a good hand,

1483
01:07:16,260 --> 01:07:18,210
you want to bet to get
the other guy to fold.

1484
01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:21,420
And basically from a game
theoretic perspective,

1485
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:23,250
since we have these
options, there's

1486
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:25,650
no way for us to
essentially agree

1487
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:28,320
that we're going to just check
down and see the river, which

1488
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:32,630
is why I consider collusion
of players actually do this.

1489
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:35,760
So nonetheless, I do
the most selfish line,

1490
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,680
which is just go all in.

1491
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:40,050
But yeah, if this guy
was my best friend

1492
01:07:40,050 --> 01:07:43,350
and I wanted to cheat, then
I could just call and let

1493
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:45,300
him call and then
just check it down

1494
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:46,680
even if I flopped the nut flush.

1495
01:07:51,850 --> 01:07:54,630
OK, so now it's heads up.

1496
01:07:54,630 --> 01:07:57,780
OK, I'll try to show every hand.

1497
01:07:57,780 --> 01:07:59,105
OK, so now ICM doesn't matter.

1498
01:07:59,105 --> 01:08:01,230
But it would be good to
show a little heads up play

1499
01:08:01,230 --> 01:08:03,780
because I don't think
we've done too much

1500
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:05,910
heads up play in this class.

1501
01:08:05,910 --> 01:08:07,230
So we call here.

1502
01:08:07,230 --> 01:08:09,990
And we check.

1503
01:08:09,990 --> 01:08:11,520
He makes it 32.

1504
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:16,359
And I just have to
check-raise bluff this flop.

1505
01:08:16,359 --> 01:08:17,460
I think it's close.

1506
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:20,370
I think I probably
shouldn't be folding.

1507
01:08:20,370 --> 01:08:23,370
I think jack-6 suited
just has too many backdoor

1508
01:08:23,370 --> 01:08:28,529
draws on this flop to ever fold
just as part of my strategy.

1509
01:08:28,529 --> 01:08:31,720
I think I decided that I
wanted my strategy to be I'm

1510
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:35,490
going to raise good
hands, like 8s and 4s.

1511
01:08:35,490 --> 01:08:38,520
And then I'm going to also raise
hands with lots of backdoor

1512
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:40,290
draws like jack-6 of hearts.

1513
01:08:40,290 --> 01:08:43,950
So I decide to do this.

1514
01:08:43,950 --> 01:08:47,890
So unfortunately he
goes all in, so we fold.

1515
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:48,890
It doesn't quite work.

1516
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:55,054
So queen-10 off, we raise.

1517
01:08:55,054 --> 01:08:56,470
Oh, so one thing
I should say is--

1518
01:08:56,470 --> 01:08:59,140
I think most of you know
this-- but once a tournament

1519
01:08:59,140 --> 01:09:02,319
gets heads up and it's just a
small blind and the big blind,

1520
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:04,514
the small blind is
actually has position.

1521
01:09:04,514 --> 01:09:06,680
So normally when it's small
blind against big blind,

1522
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:08,790
the bid blind has
position postflop.

1523
01:09:08,790 --> 01:09:10,810
But when it's heads
up as a small blind,

1524
01:09:10,810 --> 01:09:12,160
you actually have position.

1525
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:14,483
So you're very strongly
incentivized to play

1526
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:15,399
from this small blind.

1527
01:09:15,399 --> 01:09:17,380
It's just by far
the better position

1528
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:20,150
because you have
position, and you

1529
01:09:20,150 --> 01:09:22,810
have to put in less of a blind.

1530
01:09:22,810 --> 01:09:25,029
So another cheat that--
so I'm teaching you guys

1531
01:09:25,029 --> 01:09:26,356
all these different cheats.

1532
01:09:26,356 --> 01:09:27,939
Another cheat that
people used to do--

1533
01:09:27,939 --> 01:09:28,990
it's not really a cheat.

1534
01:09:28,990 --> 01:09:33,460
But another angle shoot people
used to do back in the day is

1535
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:36,970
there would be people who
normally play pretty low

1536
01:09:36,970 --> 01:09:41,109
stakes, let's say, $0.25, $0.50.

1537
01:09:41,109 --> 01:09:44,260
They would set up
these $25, $50 tables.

1538
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:47,020
So where the blinds
are $25, $50, which

1539
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:50,500
is really high stakes for them.

1540
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:53,200
They really don't have the
bankroll to gamble that.

1541
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:55,180
But their strategy
basically is if you're

1542
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:57,910
the first to sit
down, you get to be

1543
01:09:57,910 --> 01:09:59,590
the dealer on the first hand.

1544
01:09:59,590 --> 01:10:02,440
So their strategy
is basically just

1545
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:05,019
sit there and then wait for
someone else to sit down.

1546
01:10:05,019 --> 01:10:07,060
And then play the first
hand as the dealer, where

1547
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:08,810
they have a huge advantage.

1548
01:10:08,810 --> 01:10:11,185
They can just raise, and
usually the other guy will fold,

1549
01:10:11,185 --> 01:10:14,320
and they'll win 50 bucks,
which is a huge deal to them.

1550
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:16,900
And then they'll just
leave after the first hand.

1551
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:19,840
So this is something that
happened quite a lot.

1552
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,520
So my friends and
I, we've talked

1553
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,740
about playing a
crazy strategy, where

1554
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:26,400
you would sit down knowing this
is what the other guy's going

1555
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:27,130
to do.

1556
01:10:27,130 --> 01:10:28,960
And then sit down with him.

1557
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:31,240
We would have the
capital to take on risk.

1558
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:33,550
And then we would basically
just play the first hand

1559
01:10:33,550 --> 01:10:35,340
extremely aggressively.

1560
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:37,900
And knowing that the guy has
been fold most of the time,

1561
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:41,570
because if he calls, that's
all his money on the site.

1562
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:45,154
So yeah, it led to a
lot of weird dynamics.

1563
01:10:45,154 --> 01:10:47,840
But OK, so here we have--

1564
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:50,410
This is why I chose
tournaments, not cash games.

1565
01:10:50,410 --> 01:10:52,720
There's fewer ways to do
these when you use cheats.

1566
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:54,535
So queen-10, we raise.

1567
01:10:54,535 --> 01:10:57,228
We take it down.

1568
01:10:57,228 --> 01:10:59,110
Next hand we get
ace-queen suited.

1569
01:10:59,110 --> 01:11:00,590
So unfortunately we get a walk.

1570
01:11:03,190 --> 01:11:05,260
So queen-8, we raise.

1571
01:11:05,260 --> 01:11:08,080
We take it down--
sorry, he calls.

1572
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:09,340
And then it's checked to us.

1573
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:11,380
We continuation bet.

1574
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:14,890
And he raises, which
is weird because it's

1575
01:11:14,890 --> 01:11:17,521
a flop that's a lot better
for my range than his

1576
01:11:17,521 --> 01:11:19,270
because I can have
ace-king and ace-queen.

1577
01:11:19,270 --> 01:11:21,228
And even ace-jack, I
think, if he had ace-jack,

1578
01:11:21,228 --> 01:11:23,260
he would have reraised preflop.

1579
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:27,389
So in some sense it's
weird because it's

1580
01:11:27,389 --> 01:11:28,930
really hard for him
to have, I think,

1581
01:11:28,930 --> 01:11:30,640
pocket aces or pocket 8s.

1582
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:32,910
Or even pocket 3s,
he probably would

1583
01:11:32,910 --> 01:11:34,330
have reraised all on preflop.

1584
01:11:34,330 --> 01:11:36,662
So really it's like,
what do you have?

1585
01:11:36,662 --> 01:11:37,870
It's like, I don't have much.

1586
01:11:37,870 --> 01:11:40,540
But really it's like,
what do you have?

1587
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:45,970
So it's weird because I expect
him to check-raise this flop so

1588
01:11:45,970 --> 01:11:49,740
rarely that what he does, on
the one hand, it's just strange.

1589
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:52,570
But on the other hand,
he must know that.

1590
01:11:52,570 --> 01:11:54,160
I'm assuming it's
somewhat balanced,

1591
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:57,670
and he will occasionally turn
up ace-3 or something here.

1592
01:11:57,670 --> 01:12:00,760
So I decide to call
and see one more card.

1593
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:02,890
I don't know if that's great.

1594
01:12:02,890 --> 01:12:05,350
Maybe I should have just
folded and just believed him

1595
01:12:05,350 --> 01:12:08,770
or just reraised if
I didn't believe him.

1596
01:12:08,770 --> 01:12:10,210
Reraise essentially is a bluff.

1597
01:12:10,210 --> 01:12:13,540
Make it 100,000, and
just hope he folds.

1598
01:12:13,540 --> 01:12:14,800
But I decide to call.

1599
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:17,380
The turn is a 9 putting
out some straight draws

1600
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:19,330
but no flush draws.

1601
01:12:19,330 --> 01:12:22,420
That's fairly big, and I fold.

1602
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:25,090
I don't really know how I feel
about how I played that hand.

1603
01:12:25,090 --> 01:12:27,400
I think I mostly
played exploitatively.

1604
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:30,120
I just called the flop because
I wanted to see what he did,

1605
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:32,400
and I folded the
turn because maybe

1606
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:35,020
based on his bet sizing
or his bet timing,

1607
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:36,150
I just felt like he had it.

1608
01:12:36,150 --> 01:12:39,029
So I'm not sure I'm
extremely happy with how

1609
01:12:39,029 --> 01:12:39,820
I played that hand.

1610
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:41,950
But probably just at
the time, I decided

1611
01:12:41,950 --> 01:12:45,310
to play exploitatively and
try to play best against how

1612
01:12:45,310 --> 01:12:47,680
I expect him to act.

1613
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:54,160
So here 10-7 off, I
decide to reraise.

1614
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:57,720
So the reason I reraise a
hand as bad as 10-7 offsuit--

1615
01:12:57,720 --> 01:13:01,360
I talked a bit about this two
classes ago about your preflop

1616
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:02,560
raising strategy.

1617
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:04,360
So essentially
what I'm doing is I

1618
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:06,820
want to be reraising
my good hands

1619
01:13:06,820 --> 01:13:10,690
and also my hands that I'm
not sad if he goes all in,

1620
01:13:10,690 --> 01:13:13,060
and I have to fold, and I
don't get to see a flop with.

1621
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:17,420
So if I had 10-7 suited,
that's too good of a hand.

1622
01:13:17,420 --> 01:13:19,300
And I really don't
want to reraise.

1623
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:22,480
And then if he goes all in,
fold my pretty 10-7 suited

1624
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:24,550
and not even get to
see a flop with it.

1625
01:13:24,550 --> 01:13:26,950
But 10-7 offsuit is
a bad enough hand

1626
01:13:26,950 --> 01:13:29,290
where I'm not that sad
if he just goes all in,

1627
01:13:29,290 --> 01:13:30,370
and I have to fold.

1628
01:13:30,370 --> 01:13:33,130
So that's why I'm
raising my good hands

1629
01:13:33,130 --> 01:13:37,050
and also my weakest
possible hands

1630
01:13:37,050 --> 01:13:40,930
that I'm OK if I don't
get to see a flop with.

1631
01:13:40,930 --> 01:13:43,660
He does call unfortunately,
but we do hit a great flop.

1632
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:46,360
So I'm just going to
bet and get it all in.

1633
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:49,540
Heads up basically any
top pair is, in general,

1634
01:13:49,540 --> 01:13:53,540
just way more good enough to
put all your money in with.

1635
01:13:53,540 --> 01:13:54,610
He folds, though.

1636
01:13:54,610 --> 01:13:55,740
So ace-6, we raise.

1637
01:13:55,740 --> 01:13:57,490
I'm going to go fairly
quickly because I'm

1638
01:13:57,490 --> 01:13:58,885
running a bit short of time.

1639
01:13:58,885 --> 01:14:03,760
We continuation bet the
flop and take it down.

1640
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:04,420
He raises here.

1641
01:14:04,420 --> 01:14:08,650
I call with king-6, which
is pretty borderline.

1642
01:14:08,650 --> 01:14:11,590
It's too good a hand to
fold, but probably it's

1643
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:12,700
too bad a hand to call.

1644
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:14,740
Probably I should
have just raised

1645
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:16,550
by the same logic as before.

1646
01:14:16,550 --> 01:14:17,530
But we call.

1647
01:14:17,530 --> 01:14:19,510
And I decide to donk
out on this flop

1648
01:14:19,510 --> 01:14:24,690
because I figured there's a
number of draws I can have.

1649
01:14:24,690 --> 01:14:26,710
And here I do have a weak draw.

1650
01:14:26,710 --> 01:14:30,800
A 7 gives me a bad
streak but still

1651
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,920
a very good hand in
the two-player pot.

1652
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:33,480
He calls.

1653
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:35,560
And the turn is a
jack, which I still

1654
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:38,260
have a straight draw because
now a queen gives me a straight.

1655
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:41,020
So I continue bluffing.

1656
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:44,010
So he folds, which is good.

1657
01:14:44,010 --> 01:14:47,240
6-2 offsuit I just
give one to them.

1658
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:49,300
So yeah, I think you
should be playing

1659
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:51,280
90-95% percent of buttons.

1660
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:53,680
Maybe not that high when
it's getting shallower,

1661
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:55,590
but at least 80% of buttons.

1662
01:14:55,590 --> 01:14:59,470
But 2-3 offsuit is one of the
hands I'm OK with folding.

1663
01:14:59,470 --> 01:15:02,320
8-5 suited, I'm just
check-raising this flopping,

1664
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:03,970
getting it in.

1665
01:15:03,970 --> 01:15:04,730
He folds-- yeah?

1666
01:15:04,730 --> 01:15:06,610
AUDIENCE: Let's say
you had an opponent

1667
01:15:06,610 --> 01:15:10,650
that from the big blind was
very likely to three-bet you.

1668
01:15:10,650 --> 01:15:12,850
How would you adjust
your range opening

1669
01:15:12,850 --> 01:15:14,440
from the button or
the small blind?

1670
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:17,660
WILL MA: Oh, OK.

1671
01:15:17,660 --> 01:15:19,690
So if they're really
loose, you would basically

1672
01:15:19,690 --> 01:15:22,210
raise only your good
hands that you're hoping

1673
01:15:22,210 --> 01:15:23,481
they reraise all in with.

1674
01:15:23,481 --> 01:15:23,980
And--

1675
01:15:23,980 --> 01:15:27,020
AUDIENCE: So would that be
from maybe 60% of your hands

1676
01:15:27,020 --> 01:15:27,870
down from 80?

1677
01:15:27,870 --> 01:15:29,910
WILL MA: Oh, yeah.

1678
01:15:29,910 --> 01:15:31,330
You would basically raise less.

1679
01:15:31,330 --> 01:15:33,074
So it'd just have more
value essentially.

1680
01:15:33,074 --> 01:15:35,240
AUDIENCE: It's hard to
calibrate that range, though,

1681
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:36,640
as what's a good hand.

1682
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:39,280
WILL MA: Yeah, and also another
thing you can do is call more.

1683
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,620
I don't think it gets relevant
in this heads up match.

1684
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:43,382
But sometimes it
gets shallow enough

1685
01:15:43,382 --> 01:15:45,340
where you actually want
to have a calling range

1686
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:48,740
preflop from the button.

1687
01:15:48,740 --> 01:15:52,210
OK, so king-10.

1688
01:15:52,210 --> 01:15:53,810
OK, so I do call here.

1689
01:15:53,810 --> 01:15:55,960
I think I essentially
call, thinking

1690
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:58,340
I would call if he went
all in but also just

1691
01:15:58,340 --> 01:16:01,930
to make it so that I
can also sometimes call

1692
01:16:01,930 --> 01:16:04,070
a hand like 10-4 offsuit.

1693
01:16:04,070 --> 01:16:07,190
And he can't just shove any
2 and expect me to fold.

1694
01:16:07,190 --> 01:16:08,840
So I decide to call here.

1695
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:13,910
We get a great flop, so I
check it back as a slow play.

1696
01:16:13,910 --> 01:16:15,470
He checks again on the turn.

1697
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:16,970
So I bet.

1698
01:16:16,970 --> 01:16:18,470
He calls.

1699
01:16:18,470 --> 01:16:20,750
The river he leads
out quite big.

1700
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:24,890
And I just call because I
think raising I'll usually only

1701
01:16:24,890 --> 01:16:26,840
get called by better.

1702
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:28,850
And he actually turns
up a flush here.

1703
01:16:28,850 --> 01:16:30,530
So it's a weird hand.

1704
01:16:30,530 --> 01:16:32,450
It seems like we could
have lost a lot more.

1705
01:16:32,450 --> 01:16:34,850
But I'm not saying our
opponent played the hand badly,

1706
01:16:34,850 --> 01:16:38,280
but we were very lucky to
lose this little when we have

1707
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:40,640
a two pair against a flush.

1708
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:45,290
And we only lost, essentially,
four big blinds or something.

1709
01:16:45,290 --> 01:16:48,100
I guess I'll be happy
to get away with that.

1710
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:51,561
OK, I'll probably run two
or three minutes over time.

1711
01:16:51,561 --> 01:16:52,310
I'll try to hurry.

1712
01:16:52,310 --> 01:16:55,310
But I don't want to not
finish the tournament today.

1713
01:16:55,310 --> 01:16:56,780
So we fooled this.

1714
01:16:56,780 --> 01:17:00,545
Maybe I'll skip forward a bit
to some of the bigger pots.

1715
01:17:03,164 --> 01:17:04,080
So what happened here?

1716
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,030
So we raise jack-6.

1717
01:17:05,030 --> 01:17:06,136
He goes all in.

1718
01:17:06,136 --> 01:17:06,635
We fold.

1719
01:17:12,638 --> 01:17:13,990
All right, let's go do this one.

1720
01:17:13,990 --> 01:17:16,759
OK, so king-- so OK, so the
match has gone on for a bit.

1721
01:17:16,759 --> 01:17:17,800
He's won a bunch of pots.

1722
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:18,880
He catching up.

1723
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,290
He's catching up.

1724
01:17:20,290 --> 01:17:21,520
King-3 off, we raise.

1725
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:22,570
He calls.

1726
01:17:22,570 --> 01:17:25,060
So here the flop I
think is-- so once again

1727
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:29,260
it's a situation where I don't
think he ever has an ace.

1728
01:17:29,260 --> 01:17:32,440
So I'm basically
betting at 100%.

1729
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:33,160
He calls.

1730
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:36,280
The turn's another ace,
which is a bad card for us

1731
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:40,080
because now it's less
likely we have an ace.

1732
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:42,060
But normally, I still
think it's a fine spot

1733
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:45,910
to bluff just because he
essentially can't have an ace

1734
01:17:45,910 --> 01:17:46,870
and we can.

1735
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:49,640
But I think king-high is
good enough here where

1736
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:52,780
I am going to win the pot by
checking it down with king-high

1737
01:17:52,780 --> 01:17:56,090
often enough that
bluffing is superfluous.

1738
01:17:56,090 --> 01:17:57,474
So I just check.

1739
01:17:57,474 --> 01:17:58,390
And it's checked down.

1740
01:17:58,390 --> 01:18:00,610
And he was actually
trapping with king-9 here.

1741
01:18:00,610 --> 01:18:03,290
So he wins that one.

1742
01:18:03,290 --> 01:18:05,380
Yeah, and probably he
wouldn't have folded.

1743
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:08,950
Let's say, I bet the turn
and went all in on the river.

1744
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:11,530
Probably he has to call just
because it's almost the best

1745
01:18:11,530 --> 01:18:13,570
hand he can possibly have.

1746
01:18:13,570 --> 01:18:15,580
It pretty much is the
best hand you can possibly

1747
01:18:15,580 --> 01:18:17,560
have other than maybe 7-6.

1748
01:18:22,111 --> 01:18:23,450
I think nothing happens there.

1749
01:18:23,450 --> 01:18:26,310
So let me see.

1750
01:18:26,310 --> 01:18:28,790
OK, so yeah, we lose a bunch
of pots because we raise

1751
01:18:28,790 --> 01:18:31,640
and he reraises and we fold.

1752
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:34,330
So things aren't
looking too good.

1753
01:18:34,330 --> 01:18:37,340
Oh, so I actually
made a hero fold here.

1754
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:39,650
I think, once again, this
is an exploitative play.

1755
01:18:39,650 --> 01:18:42,847
I would probably never fold
this from an optimal strategy

1756
01:18:42,847 --> 01:18:43,430
point of view.

1757
01:18:43,430 --> 01:18:46,160
I think an ace in heads
up with only 20 big blinds

1758
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:47,120
is way too good.

1759
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:50,570
But he did just reraise
me two hands ago.

1760
01:18:50,570 --> 01:18:51,280
And I don't know.

1761
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:54,050
I think at the time I just felt
like he almost certainly had it

1762
01:18:54,050 --> 01:18:56,600
when he did this.

1763
01:18:56,600 --> 01:19:01,640
I made an exploitative fold
based on what I thought he had.

1764
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:03,320
So the next hand, he raises.

1765
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:04,670
We go all in with pocket 5s.

1766
01:19:04,670 --> 01:19:06,490
And we've never
[INAUDIBLE] the ace-jack

1767
01:19:06,490 --> 01:19:07,894
which is pretty stupid.

1768
01:19:11,030 --> 01:19:12,360
Yeah, I was very surprised.

1769
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:15,260
I was basically
ready to just leave.

1770
01:19:15,260 --> 01:19:17,037
I was probably in some
other tournaments.

1771
01:19:17,037 --> 01:19:18,870
But I basically was
ready to close the table

1772
01:19:18,870 --> 01:19:20,328
and focus on the
other tournaments.

1773
01:19:20,328 --> 01:19:23,510
But somehow we get there.

1774
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:25,620
And then the tournament
just is easy from there.

1775
01:19:25,620 --> 01:19:26,161
We get ace-9.

1776
01:19:26,161 --> 01:19:26,900
We go all in.

1777
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:27,870
He folds.

1778
01:19:27,870 --> 01:19:30,170
And then he goes all
in into our pocket 6s.

1779
01:19:30,170 --> 01:19:32,240
And we hit a
straight, so we win.

1780
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:36,367
Right,

1781
01:19:36,367 --> 01:19:38,450
So I played through all
the hands at a tournament.

1782
01:19:38,450 --> 01:19:40,650
Once again, there's a lot
of selection bias there.

1783
01:19:40,650 --> 01:19:43,210
But hopefully you learned
some stuff from that.

1784
01:19:43,210 --> 01:19:44,920
So there's two classes left.

1785
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:50,381
Next class, I'll wrap up the
theory and the exact poker

1786
01:19:50,381 --> 01:19:50,880
example.

1787
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,924
So I'll talk a bit
more about cash games

1788
01:19:52,924 --> 01:19:54,965
and show you how to play
when you're really deep.

1789
01:19:54,965 --> 01:19:56,900
I talked about postflop raising.

1790
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:58,640
And then Friday we
have a guest lecture

1791
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:01,610
from Bill Chen, which
should be really exciting.

1792
01:20:01,610 --> 01:20:03,690
He always talks about
very interesting stuff.

1793
01:20:03,690 --> 01:20:06,640
So I'll see you guys around.
