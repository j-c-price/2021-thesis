191
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,550

193
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:02,829

00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:13,390

205
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:19,660
 must come together so if we look at his

00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,660
 

207
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:21,490

00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,950
 

211
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:25,600
 regression tree but from 1984 I remember

212
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,600
 

213
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:28,839
 buying it then that was in a previous

214
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:28,839
 

215
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,390
 summer of AI but also of course random

216
00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:31,390
 

217
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:34,180
 forest sandbagging have have made him a

218
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,180
 

219
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:36,970
 you know a hugely important and sighted

220
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,970
 

221
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:39,190
 name in machine learning and I suppose

222
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,190
 

223
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:41,800
 I'm trying to in my small way to carry

224
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,800
 

225
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:44,260
 on that tradition to show how the

226
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:44,260
 

227
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,510
 connection between statistical ideas and

228
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,510
 

229
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:49,240
 machine learning can be so important um

230
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,240
 

231
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:51,160
 as was said you know I've had a sort of

232
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,160
 

233
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,680
 history in this again back in the summer

234
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,680
 

235
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:56,230
 of AI I used to work on uncertainty

236
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:56,230
 

237
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,079
 propagation in in Bayesian networks and

238
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,079
 

239
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:00,970
 there was the early universe uncertainty

240
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:00,970
 

241
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:03,130
 in artificial intelligence conferences

242
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,130
 

243
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:06,579
 in the late 80s oh really golden time

244
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,579
 

245
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:09,100
 and so that led to a extra work but also

246
00:13:06,569 --> 00:13:09,100
 

247
00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:11,019
 then the the idea of Bayesian graphical

248
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,019
 

249
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:13,209
 models was realized at the end of the

250
00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:13,209
 

251
00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:14,829
 night you know the end of 1980s as being

252
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:14,829
 

253
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:16,930
 incredibly important and that led us to

254
00:13:14,819 --> 00:13:16,930
 

255
00:13:14,829 --> 00:13:19,449
 develop the bug software which has led

256
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,449
 

257
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:22,959
 to Stan and all the all the other math

258
00:13:19,439 --> 00:13:22,959
 

259
00:13:19,449 --> 00:13:25,240
 wonderful work in Bayesian MCMC ok so

260
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:25,240
 

261
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,410
 but as was told and it's since then in

262
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,410
 

263
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,390
 the last ten years I've really gone over

264
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,390
 

265
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:30,339
 it almost into the entertainment

266
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,339
 

267
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:32,290
 industry I've gone into can into

268
00:13:30,329 --> 00:13:32,290
 

269
00:13:30,339 --> 00:13:35,410
 communication so doing making

270
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,410
 

271
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:38,470
 documentaries for the BBC and you know

272
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,470
 

273
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:39,640
 peering on on reality shows like winter

274
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,640
 

275
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:41,620
 wipeout and

276
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,620
 

277
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:44,290
 as was mentioned I am world champion of

278
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:44,290
 

279
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:48,160
 loop which is a pool table with you know

280
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:48,160
 

281
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:50,200
 one hole and an elliptical shape but my

282
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,200
 

283
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,200
 main what the work I want to talk about

284
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:53,200
 

285
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:56,230
 summer today is by this team this is

286
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:56,230
 

287
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,060
 winter this is a group that now I'm

288
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,060
 

289
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:59,470
 chair of in the maths Department in

290
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,470
 

291
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:02,170
 Cambridge but none of them are

292
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:02,170
 

293
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:04,810
 mathematicians or even statisticians for

294
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,810
 

295
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:07,270
 psychologists 2x BBC communication

296
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,270
 

297
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:10,510
 people web designers all of whom are

298
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:10,510
 

299
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:14,140
 concerned with the communication of risk

300
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,140
 

301
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:16,270
 and evidence and and science and to

302
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:16,270
 

303
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:18,730
 evaluate those communications in an

304
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,730
 

305
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:22,630
 empirical and formal way so that's the

306
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,630
 

307
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:23,710
 that's my my my running theme ok so what

308
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,710
 

309
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:25,380
 am I going to talk about I'm going to

310
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,380
 

311
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:28,000
 dot around a bit with some historical

312
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:28,000
 

313
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:31,360
 suitable for in an old person like me

314
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:31,360
 

315
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,130
 some historical stories I want to talk

316
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,130
 

317
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,450
 about trust and I want to talk

318
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,450
 

319
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:37,600
 particular about a structure for

320
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,600
 

321
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:39,640
 evaluation and then I want I want to

322
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,640
 

323
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,250
 talk about statistical methods to

324
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:42,250
 

325
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:44,500
 ranking a set of algorithms laird

326
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,500
 

327
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:47,200
 explanations explaining regression

328
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:47,200
 

329
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,520
 models communicating uncertainty and all

330
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,520
 

331
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,800
 of this how some fairly basic

332
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,800
 

333
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:54,460
 statistical science might help in these

334
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:54,460
 

335
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:56,680
 issues particularly on on explanation my

336
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,680
 

337
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:58,240
 primary focus is on medical applications

338
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,240
 

339
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,010
 because that's why I've worked on

340
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,010
 

341
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,040
 traditionally but I hope the general

342
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,040
 

343
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:05,770
 ideas are important and of course I can

344
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,770
 

345
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:08,230
 only scrape the surface ok trust and

346
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,230
 

347
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:10,120
 anyone in the UK who talks about trust

348
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,120
 

349
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:11,980
 immediately goes to this woman she's

350
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,980
 

351
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:14,620
 Baroness and Nora O'Neill she's a

352
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:14,620
 

353
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:16,210
 philosopher of Kant and she is an

354
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,210
 

355
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:18,940
 extraordinary person I really recommend

356
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,940
 

357
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:20,530
 her TED talk 9 minutes on trust with

358
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,530
 

359
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:22,570
 jokes she's brilliant absolutely

360
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,570
 

361
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:24,580
 brilliant and she has had a big

362
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,580
 

363
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:26,110
 influence with just a few I'm going to

364
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,110
 

365
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:28,510
 mention a couple of times a few little

366
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,510
 

367
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:31,210
 you know nuggets of wisdom she is boiled

368
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,210
 

369
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:33,460
 down and one of the first ones says that

370
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,460
 

371
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:34,150
 organisations should not try to be

372
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:34,150
 

373
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:37,780
 trusted

374
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:37,780
 

375
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:40,330
 that is the wrong objective to want to

376
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,330
 

377
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:42,370
 be trusted because that is not in our

378
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,370
 

379
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:44,530
 control that has to be offered up to us

380
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,530
 

381
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:47,350
 we have to earn it and the way we earn

382
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,350
 

383
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:49,600
 it is by demonstrating trustworthiness

384
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,600
 

385
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:50,860
 so I'm not gonna mention trust anymore

386
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,860
 

387
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,860
 I'm just going to talk about

388
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,860
 

389
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:54,570
 demonstrating trustworthiness

390
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:54,570
 

391
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,190
 this has become incredibly important in

392
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,190
 

393
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:58,890
 the UK the Office of National Statistics

394
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,890
 

395
00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:02,220
 has got a new code of practice and the

396
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,220
 

397
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:05,040
 number one aim is to be trustworthy not

398
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:05,040
 

399
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:06,960
 to be trusted to be trustworthy okay so

400
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,960
 

401
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,240
 what does that mean in this context well

402
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:09,240
 

403
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:10,740
 you know we see lots of claims about

404
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:10,740
 

405
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,210
 algorithms here's you know here's just a

406
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,210
 

407
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:15,690
 few you know that have come out recently

408
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,690
 

409
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:17,970
 in the UK about about their skills in in

410
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,970
 

411
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:19,590
 medical diagnosis I'm not saying these

412
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,590
 

413
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:21,240
 are wrong claims I'm just saying this is

414
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,240
 

415
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:23,910
 a sort of claim that's being made all

416
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,910
 

417
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,920
 the time and I think this is one of the

418
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,920
 

419
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:28,290
 running themes throughout this talk and

420
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:28,290
 

421
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:31,590
 I think is quite important is that we

422
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,590
 

423
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:32,940
 should be making trustworthy claims we

424
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,940
 

425
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:36,270
 should and we should expect to hear

426
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:36,270
 

427
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:39,030
 trustworthy claims from developers both

428
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,030
 

429
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:41,760
 about that the system is trustworthy

430
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,760
 

431
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:45,030
 itself so the trustworthiness of the

432
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:45,030
 

433
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:47,490
 claims made by the algorithm but also

434
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,490
 

435
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:50,040
 the trustworthiness of the claims made

436
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,040
 

437
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:52,620
 about to the algorithm about how good it

438
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,620
 

439
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,720
 is about what its impact might be so

440
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,720
 

441
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:56,670
 those two things which are connected but

442
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,670
 

443
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,160
 then very useful to keep them separate

444
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,160
 

445
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:01,470
 what the trustworthiness of the system

446
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,470
 

447
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,540
 itself compared with what is said about

448
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,540
 

449
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:06,960
 it and both I'm going to be looking at

450
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:06,960
 

451
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:08,730
 both of those today okay one of the

452
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,730
 

453
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,800
 first contributions that I think

454
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,800
 

455
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:12,990
 statistics can make in this is by

456
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,990
 

457
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:15,650
 looking at its huge long experience of

458
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,650
 

459
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:18,240
 evaluation other technologies or

460
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,240
 

461
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:20,880
 pharmaceutical drugs there's a massive

462
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,880
 

463
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,520
 amount of experience in research design

464
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:22,520
 

465
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,740
 and in whatever call the phased

466
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:25,740
 

467
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:28,320
 evaluation and it's completely standard

468
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,320
 

469
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:29,970
 within the medical industry the

470
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,970
 

471
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,590
 pharmaceutical industry that the

472
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,590
 

473
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:34,860
 development of US farmers new drug

474
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,860
 

475
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:38,400
 follows a four phase pattern phase one

476
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:38,400
 

477
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:40,080
 is just safety testing into individuals

478
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,080
 

479
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:44,040
 healthy individuals volunteers they get

480
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:44,040
 

481
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:46,320
 paid to get have to take drugs yeah you

482
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,320
 

483
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:48,750
 know and it's not always safe phase two

484
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,750
 

485
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,820
 is way Michael proof of concept it's

486
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,820
 

487
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:52,680
 testing on selected individuals to get

488
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:52,680
 

489
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:55,110
 an idea of the optimum administration

490
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:55,110
 

491
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:57,570
 optimum dosage and so on because all of

492
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,570
 

493
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:59,580
 this is building up to phase three which

494
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,580
 

495
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:01,830
 is the crucial thing and these are the

496
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,830
 

497
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:03,450
 big randomized controlled trials these

498
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,450
 

499
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:06,330
 are the ones that are submitted to the

500
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,330
 

501
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:08,730
 FDA for approval if you got to

502
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,730
 

503
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:10,590
 and trials big independent trials then

504
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,590
 

505
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:12,240
 possibly your drug will be approved for

506
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,240
 

507
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,710
 marketing and after that you go on to

508
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,710
 

509
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,020
 phase four which is post marketing

510
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,020
 

511
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:17,790
 surveillance versus safety monitoring

512
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,790
 

513
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:20,190
 for adverse effect when it's out there

514
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,190
 

515
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:21,540
 in the community being used and what I'd

516
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,540
 

517
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,950
 like to suggest and it's not just me

518
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:22,950
 

519
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:25,560
 there are many other people have

520
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,560
 

521
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:28,620
 suggested this over the last 40 years or

522
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:28,620
 

523
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:30,630
 35 years is that within the area of

524
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,630
 

525
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:33,660
 algorithm development there's a very

526
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,660
 

527
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:36,510
 neat four phase structure that we see

528
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:36,510
 

529
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:38,460
 about us all the time and and the first

530
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,460
 

531
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:40,560
 phase we might call the digital testing

532
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,560
 

533
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:42,570
 that's the standard testing on you know

534
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,570
 

535
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,940
 on test sets and the standard stuff that

536
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,940
 

537
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:45,990
 we all you know everyone does with it

538
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:45,990
 

539
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:48,600
 when they're just working on the

540
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,600
 

541
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:50,370
 computer the next phase is the

542
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,370
 

543
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:53,070
 laboratory test that's where you start

544
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,070
 

545
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:54,780
 opening up the system to users to see

546
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,780
 

547
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:57,000
 how what they think about it it's when

548
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:57,000
 

549
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:59,400
 you do develop the interface and we're

550
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:59,400
 

551
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,560
 using user centered design and look at

552
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:01,560
 

553
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:06,090
 its accuracy when perhaps compared with

554
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:06,090
 

555
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:08,730
 with real people phase 3 which actually

556
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,730
 

557
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:10,080
 know very few things get to is to see

558
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,080
 

559
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,490
 what is the impact when it's put in

560
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,490
 

561
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,170
 society in other words what is the

562
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,170
 

563
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:14,490
 marginal benefit it may look good it may

564
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,490
 

565
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:16,200
 be as good as an expert but actually

566
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,200
 

567
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:18,660
 does it help anybody when it's put into

568
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:18,660
 

569
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:21,210
 practice and then phase for once the

570
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:21,210
 

571
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:23,160
 system is in use is its monitoring in

572
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,160
 

573
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:25,500
 routine use it's essentially its safety

574
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:25,500
 

575
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:27,570
 pattern over time and I'm going to just

576
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,570
 

577
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:30,090
 talk about some of those those phases

578
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,090
 

579
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:32,250
 the work that's been done and new idam

580
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,250
 

581
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:35,820
 some ideas that might be useful okay

582
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,820
 

583
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:37,230
 first one digital testing and this is

584
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,230
 

585
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,520
 maybe a bit of a sideline but it's

586
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,520
 

587
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:40,410
 something I'm very interested I'm really

588
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,410
 

589
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:42,150
 interested in league tables in ranking

590
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,150
 

591
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:43,980
 I've done a lot on ranking hospitals and

592
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,980
 

593
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:46,770
 ranking schools and so when I see a

594
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:46,770
 

595
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:50,130
 kegel competition and I see algorithms

596
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,130
 

597
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:51,960
 being ranked by want to say well is that

598
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,960
 

599
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:53,790
 a good ranking can you hook sure can you

600
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,790
 

601
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,200
 be about that ranking how can you sure

602
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,200
 

603
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:57,420
 can you be that the one that's at the

604
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:57,420
 

605
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,280
 top is the best and so I'd like just

606
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:59,280
 

607
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:01,710
 like to talk about that okay now a

608
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,710
 

609
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,840
 little distraction I come from North

610
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,840
 

611
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:06,020
 Devon beautiful place recommend it for

612
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:06,020
 

613
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:09,000
 holidays Ilfracombe very nice beautiful

614
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:09,000
 

615
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:10,890
 resort on the west coast of Devon and in

616
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,890
 

617
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 the in the churchyard at all for whom I

618
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,000
 

619
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:15,840
 found

620
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:15,840
 

621
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,070
 a great stone and that gravestone wait

622
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,070
 

623
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,290
 for it I bet you can guess what's going

624
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,290
 

625
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:22,560
 to happen is to Francis William Somerton

626
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,560
 

627
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:25,500
 who perished on the Titanic disaster in

628
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:25,500
 

629
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:27,480
 a 1912 yes you were right we're gonna

630
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,480
 

631
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:32,100
 hit the Titanic sorry it's unavoidable

632
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:32,100
 

633
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:34,500
 and so um and so he died he he went down

634
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:34,500
 

635
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,520
 you know with the Titanic and he was

636
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:35,520
 

637
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,100
 travelling third-class

638
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:38,100
 

639
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,920
 on his own it's pretty likely and so

640
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:40,920
 

641
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:43,680
 actually as a terrible bit of marketing

642
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:43,680
 

643
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:45,270
 I decided to look at the Titanic data to

644
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:45,270
 

645
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,890
 plug it into a book I'm writing it's

646
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,890
 

647
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:49,440
 coming out next year so it's just too

648
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,440
 

649
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:51,840
 too good an opportunity to miss so there

650
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,840
 

651
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,280
 is some you can download you don't have

652
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,280
 

653
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,810
 to do the cowgirl competition because

654
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,810
 

655
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,610
 the Titanic data is just freely

656
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,610
 

657
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:58,800
 available online anyone can get the

658
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,800
 

659
00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:01,170
 whole lot and cheat if they wanted to

660
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,170
 

661
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,820
 not that I'm suggesting you should but

662
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,820
 

663
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:05,310
 anyway you can download it and look at

664
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:05,310
 

665
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:07,110
 you know Francis Somerton who paid 8

666
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,110
 

667
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:09,420
 pounds on a shilling for his ticket

668
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,420
 

669
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:11,490
 traveling third-class from Southampton

670
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,490
 

671
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:14,880
 he was he really had a very low chance

672
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,880
 

673
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:16,260
 of survival so um you know I'm gonna

674
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,260
 

675
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,060
 copy the structure of the Kaggle

676
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,060
 

677
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:20,910
 competition who's had to go at the

678
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:20,910
 

679
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:22,290
 Carroll competition yeah good good good

680
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,290
 

681
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:25,440
 quite a few of you yeah okay well this

682
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,440
 

683
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:27,840
 you're among 59 thousand people who have

684
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,840
 

685
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,760
 tried so there's thirteen hundred

686
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,760
 

687
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,380
 passengers I'm copying the thing of

688
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,380
 

689
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,570
 taking a training set of server and I'm

690
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,570
 

691
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:35,490
 70% and the test set of 30 percent and

692
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,490
 

693
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:37,920
 so which is the best algorithm to

694
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,920
 

695
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:41,040
 predict who survives okay there's just

696
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:41,040
 

697
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,750
 an Maria's gallery do that's good we do

698
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,750
 

699
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,780
 help me for this which I'm very grateful

700
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,780
 

701
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:47,940
 for and we did not these are not

702
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,940
 

703
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:50,160
 optimized this is using the algorithms

704
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:50,160
 

705
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:51,660
 from our carat applied we're using

706
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,660
 

707
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:54,600
 default values 10-fold cross-validation

708
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:54,600
 

709
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:57,150
 in the training set nothing fancy at all

710
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:57,150
 

711
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:59,280
 no complicated feature extraction that's

712
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,280
 

713
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:01,590
 all so really this is very crude this is

714
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:01,590
 

715
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,870
 pure demonstration and there's a list of

716
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,870
 

717
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:05,340
 some algorithms and their accuracy but

718
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,340
 

719
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:06,780
 I'm more interested in because I'm

720
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:06,780
 

721
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:08,370
 interested in probabilities I'm

722
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:08,370
 

723
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,840
 interested in mean squared error of the

724
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,840
 

725
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:11,910
 probabilities that come out of these

726
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,910
 

727
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,110
 algorithms so what is the score mean

728
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,110
 

729
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:15,840
 squared error which I'm going to call

730
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,840
 

731
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:17,760
 the breyer score statisticians call mean

732
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,760
 

733
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,260
 squared error for binary predictions

734
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,260
 

735
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,840
 they call it the Brier score because

736
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,840
 

737
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:24,300
 it's based on M Brier who is a weather

738
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:24,300
 

739
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,320
 forecaster in the 1950s and become

740
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:25,320
 

741
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,059
 because it's a standard

742
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,059
 

743
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:29,130
 metric for evaluating weather

744
00:22:27,049 --> 00:22:29,130
 

745
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:31,649
 forecasters and any other probabilistic

746
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,649
 

747
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:33,360
 prediction system okay so that's

748
00:22:31,639 --> 00:22:33,360
 

749
00:22:31,649 --> 00:22:36,269
 actually the simple classification tree

750
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:36,269
 

751
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:38,100
 came out both best by a little bit on

752
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:38,100
 

753
00:22:36,269 --> 00:22:39,960
 both of those categories they know

754
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,960
 

755
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:42,630
 that's the tree many of you will seen

756
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:42,630
 

757
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,490
 simple trees like that okay so William

758
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,490
 

759
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:46,850
 Sal Burton immediately he was a man

760
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,850
 

761
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:50,130
 turned left so he was given a seventeen

762
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,130
 

763
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:54,659
 sixteen percent chance of survival okay

764
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:54,659
 

765
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:57,539
 so we can look at those and Bryer scores

766
00:22:54,649 --> 00:22:57,539
 

767
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:59,460
 for the nine different algorithms and

768
00:22:57,529 --> 00:22:59,460
 

769
00:22:57,539 --> 00:23:01,470
 there they are ranked with the with the

770
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,470
 

771
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:03,960
 cart the simple cars at the top and it

772
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,960
 

773
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:05,519
 by a small margin it wins and you know

774
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,519
 

775
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,980
 the immediately thing you might think of

776
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,980
 

777
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:09,990
 as a statistician is to put an error bar

778
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,990
 

779
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:11,460
 around that mean squared arrow which is

780
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,460
 

781
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:13,320
 a straightforward thing to do calculate

782
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,320
 

783
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:16,590
 its standard error on the test set and

784
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:16,590
 

785
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:19,830
 we get those error bars now that looks

786
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:19,830
 

787
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:22,860
 as if the top seven algorithms are

788
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,860
 

789
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:25,710
 essentially indistinguishable that is

790
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:25,710
 

791
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:26,190
 completely wrong that is the wrong wrong

792
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,190
 

793
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:29,009
 wrong

794
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:29,009
 

795
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:31,200
 misleading graphic to do and it's

796
00:23:28,999 --> 00:23:31,200
 

797
00:23:29,009 --> 00:23:33,000
 because they're not being tested on

798
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:33,000
 

799
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,919
 independent sets of data they're all

800
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,919
 

801
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,960
 being tested on the same data we got a

802
00:23:34,909 --> 00:23:36,960
 

803
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:39,389
 paired analysis and I've seen a recent

804
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:39,389
 

805
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,720
 paper by a very prominent team that

806
00:23:39,379 --> 00:23:42,720
 

807
00:23:39,389 --> 00:23:45,090
 compared a doctor and an algorithm test

808
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:45,090
 

809
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,759
 in the same case by looking at their

810
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,759
 

811
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:49,409
 accuracy and how likely one was to be

812
00:23:47,749 --> 00:23:49,409
 

813
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:51,029
 better than the other assuming they were

814
00:23:49,399 --> 00:23:51,029
 

815
00:23:49,409 --> 00:23:53,159
 independent which gives a grossly

816
00:23:51,019 --> 00:23:53,159
 

817
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:55,379
 misleading and assessment of their

818
00:23:53,149 --> 00:23:55,379
 

819
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:56,850
 comparison so that's potentially a very

820
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:56,850
 

821
00:23:55,379 --> 00:23:58,889
 misleading graphic we have to look at

822
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,889
 

823
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:01,049
 the differences on individual cases and

824
00:23:58,879 --> 00:24:01,049
 

825
00:23:58,889 --> 00:24:03,899
 to look at that measure the difference

826
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,899
 

827
00:24:01,049 --> 00:24:05,970
 and do a standard error on that and when

828
00:24:03,889 --> 00:24:05,970
 

829
00:24:03,899 --> 00:24:08,399
 we do that we realize yeah the first

830
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,399
 

831
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:10,830
 four are not statistically significantly

832
00:24:08,389 --> 00:24:10,830
 

833
00:24:08,399 --> 00:24:12,389
 different from the winner so car was the

834
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,389
 

835
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:13,889
 best but there's three others that were

836
00:24:12,379 --> 00:24:13,889
 

837
00:24:12,389 --> 00:24:16,200
 not statistically significantly

838
00:24:13,879 --> 00:24:16,200
 

839
00:24:13,889 --> 00:24:19,169
 different from that and once but once we

840
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:19,169
 

841
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:22,200
 get down to the complex cart is just

842
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:22,200
 

843
00:24:19,169 --> 00:24:24,629
 about yeah that's P less than 0.05 being

844
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:24,629
 

845
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,129
 different from the top one so we got a

846
00:24:24,619 --> 00:24:26,129
 

847
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:28,620
 top we got a there's some at the top

848
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:28,620
 

849
00:24:26,129 --> 00:24:29,940
 which are not statistics are not

850
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:29,940
 

851
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:33,750
 significantly different from each other

852
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:33,750
 

853
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:35,309
 okay so how confident we can we be that

854
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,309
 

855
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:37,230
 cart is actually the best of those

856
00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:37,230
 

857
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:38,820
 algorithms what should Kaggle be doing

858
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,820
 

859
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:41,190
 instead of just ranking

860
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,190
 

861
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:44,160
 well you know we can rank algorithms

862
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,160
 

863
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:47,940
 what we can do is do a bootstrap sample

864
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:47,940
 

865
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:49,650
 from the test set and then when we which

866
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:49,650
 

867
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:52,110
 is sampling with replacement a set of

868
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,110
 

869
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:54,240
 412 observations from the test set and

870
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,240
 

871
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:56,130
 then rank the algorithms on that on that

872
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:56,130
 

873
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,260
 bootstrap sample and then repeat that a

874
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,260
 

875
00:24:56,130 --> 00:25:00,210
 thousandth of the thousand times and

876
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:00,210
 

877
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:02,040
 what we do is that we get a distribution

878
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,040
 

879
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:04,230
 for the possible rank of each algorithm

880
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:04,230
 

881
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:06,960
 so it's a really straightforward thing

882
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,960
 

883
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:08,820
 to do this ranks the actual algorithm if

884
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,820
 

885
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,140
 we wanted to rent rank the method we'd

886
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:10,140
 

887
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,880
 have to bootstrap the training set data

888
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:11,880
 

889
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:14,490
 as well which is more complicated or to

890
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:14,490
 

891
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,990
 repeat the whole process and then we get

892
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,990
 

893
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:17,400
 these very nice pictures which

894
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,400
 

895
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:18,900
 essentially are the probability

896
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,900
 

897
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:23,010
 distribution for the true underlying

898
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:23,010
 

899
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:24,930
 rank of each algorithm and we can see

900
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,930
 

901
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:26,280
 that there's a big spread random forest

902
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,280
 

903
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:28,520
 could be almost anywhere we don't know

904
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:28,520
 

905
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:30,960
 whether it's good or bad essentially and

906
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,960
 

907
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:33,540
 the actual we can get a probability we

908
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:33,540
 

909
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,340
 could I say that there is a 63% chance

910
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:35,340
 

911
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:36,810
 that that simple algorithm in fact does

912
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:36,810
 

913
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,910
 we go at the top in terms of mean

914
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,910
 

915
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:41,130
 squared error but 23% chance than your

916
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,130
 

917
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:43,830
 own networkers is also top an 8% chance

918
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,830
 

919
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:45,720
 the random forest is is top which gives

920
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,720
 

921
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:47,160
 us a very fair criteria when we're

922
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,160
 

923
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,750
 making comparisons we stopped just

924
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,750
 

925
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:50,160
 because some things just because

926
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,160
 

927
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:52,140
 something looks the best is not

928
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:52,140
 

929
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,670
 necessarily it is the best we know that

930
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,670
 

931
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:55,110
 for football teams we know that for

932
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,110
 

933
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:56,690
 schools we know that for everything we

934
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,690
 

935
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:59,580
 should be doing the same for algorithm

936
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,580
 

937
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:01,770
 okay just a quick little aside something

938
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:01,770
 

939
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:03,390
 which I think is a very nice thing to do

940
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,390
 

941
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:06,090
 is who is the luckiest person the

942
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:06,090
 

943
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:09,150
 Titanic any volunteers and I think it

944
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,150
 

945
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:12,930
 was this man Carl Dahle he was a 45 year

946
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:12,930
 

947
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:14,730
 old he is the man that when averaged the

948
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,730
 

949
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:17,010
 the survivor that when averaged over all

950
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,010
 

951
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:18,990
 the algorithms in the test net got the

952
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,990
 

953
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:20,660
 lowest the highest Breyer score in

954
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,660
 

955
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:23,610
 others he was the most surprising

956
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:23,610
 

957
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:26,280
 survivor he's the one who should have

958
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,280
 

959
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:29,670
 died but didn't and we can actually find

960
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:29,670
 

961
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:32,130
 his story he jumped into the water and

962
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:32,130
 

963
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:34,320
 then climbed onto lifeboat 15 they

964
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,320
 

965
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:36,240
 didn't want to take him so I think he's

966
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,240
 

967
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,340
 the man you can see they're just just

968
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:38,340
 

969
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,200
 trying to climb into the lifeboat so I

970
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,200
 

971
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:42,870
 think he just fought his way on actually

972
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:42,870
 

973
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,850
 by brute force he survived anyway on the

974
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,850
 

975
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:46,770
 others didn't and poor old Hannah some

976
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,770
 

977
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:48,630
 attorney know that Williams wife was

978
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,630
 

979
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:51,960
 left in Ilfracombe with just five quid

980
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:51,960
 

981
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:52,509
 to her name okay quickly now on to phase

982
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:52,509
 

983
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,249
 two

984
00:26:52,499 --> 00:26:54,249
 

985
00:26:52,509 --> 00:26:56,799
 laboratory testing now this is something

986
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:56,799
 

987
00:26:54,249 --> 00:26:58,839
 that's becoming very popular using what

988
00:26:56,789 --> 00:26:58,839
 

989
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:00,729
 you might call and it's a kind of

990
00:26:58,829 --> 00:27:00,729
 

991
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:02,979
 analogy of the Turing test Alan Turing's

992
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:02,979
 

993
00:27:00,729 --> 00:27:05,859
 making his first appearance aside this

994
00:27:02,969 --> 00:27:05,859
 

995
00:27:02,979 --> 00:27:08,019
 morning so if we go back to 1950 during

996
00:27:05,849 --> 00:27:08,019
 

997
00:27:05,859 --> 00:27:09,820
 his classic paper introduces the idea of

998
00:27:08,009 --> 00:27:09,820
 

999
00:27:08,019 --> 00:27:11,289
 a Turing test in which an observer has

1000
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:11,289
 

1001
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:13,839
 to try to tell the difference between a

1002
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,839
 

1003
00:27:11,289 --> 00:27:17,049
 computer and a human and that's the

1004
00:27:13,829 --> 00:27:17,049
 

1005
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:20,139
 Turing test the the method the the sort

1006
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,139
 

1007
00:27:17,049 --> 00:27:21,549
 of it's not people aren't doing exactly

1008
00:27:20,129 --> 00:27:21,549
 

1009
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:23,679
 that but they're doing a quite similar

1010
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:23,679
 

1011
00:27:21,549 --> 00:27:25,269
 thing which is we take a set of dot is a

1012
00:27:23,669 --> 00:27:25,269
 

1013
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:27,849
 random set of doctors that you might

1014
00:27:25,259 --> 00:27:27,849
 

1015
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:29,319
 that you might use as your M as to

1016
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:29,319
 

1017
00:27:27,849 --> 00:27:30,579
 compare the computer with and one of

1018
00:27:29,309 --> 00:27:30,579
 

1019
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:32,109
 them is a computer you don't know which

1020
00:27:30,569 --> 00:27:32,109
 

1021
00:27:30,579 --> 00:27:33,819
 one and then you give them a whole lot

1022
00:27:32,099 --> 00:27:33,819
 

1023
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:36,039
 of test cases vignettes and they

1024
00:27:33,809 --> 00:27:36,039
 

1025
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:38,289
 exercise some judgment and then those

1026
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:38,289
 

1027
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:40,149
 judgments are seen by other judges

1028
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:40,149
 

1029
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:41,559
 others Assessors but they don't know

1030
00:27:40,139 --> 00:27:41,559
 

1031
00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:44,619
 which is the computer which is a human

1032
00:27:41,549 --> 00:27:44,619
 

1033
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:46,029
 and they and they so they don't try to

1034
00:27:44,609 --> 00:27:46,029
 

1035
00:27:44,619 --> 00:27:47,469
 guess which is which they just assess

1036
00:27:46,019 --> 00:27:47,469
 

1037
00:27:46,029 --> 00:27:50,199
 their scores and that enables you to

1038
00:27:47,459 --> 00:27:50,199
 

1039
00:27:47,469 --> 00:27:52,449
 make a sort of comparison of the

1040
00:27:50,189 --> 00:27:52,449
 

1041
00:27:50,199 --> 00:27:54,159
 comparative accuracy or skill of the

1042
00:27:52,439 --> 00:27:54,159
 

1043
00:27:52,449 --> 00:27:56,109
 computer compared with the human in a

1044
00:27:54,149 --> 00:27:56,109
 

1045
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,089
 blind way and so that's that's what's

1046
00:27:56,099 --> 00:27:58,089
 

1047
00:27:56,109 --> 00:28:00,190
 being done and it can actually lead to

1048
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:00,190
 

1049
00:27:58,089 --> 00:28:02,109
 some very odd results and because it

1050
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,109
 

1051
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:04,209
 what it reveals reveal can reveal is

1052
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:04,209
 

1053
00:28:02,109 --> 00:28:06,940
 that there's no gold standard in a

1054
00:28:04,199 --> 00:28:06,940
 

1055
00:28:04,209 --> 00:28:09,549
 classic test of this in 1970s by Ted

1056
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:09,549
 

1057
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:11,709
 shortlist team they found that the

1058
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:11,709
 

1059
00:28:09,549 --> 00:28:13,690
 algorithm it was thought 30 percent of

1060
00:28:11,699 --> 00:28:13,690
 

1061
00:28:11,709 --> 00:28:15,819
 the time to be unacceptable but the

1062
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,819
 

1063
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:18,039
 doctors are even worse you know

1064
00:28:15,809 --> 00:28:18,039
 

1065
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:19,749
 colleagues just disagree and it's true

1066
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,749
 

1067
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:21,789
 this way this guards against the idea

1068
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:21,789
 

1069
00:28:19,749 --> 00:28:23,349
 there is a gold standard these are being

1070
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:23,349
 

1071
00:28:21,789 --> 00:28:26,019
 done at the moment just recently in june

1072
00:28:23,339 --> 00:28:26,019
 

1073
00:28:23,349 --> 00:28:27,369
 babylon AI with its diagnostic system

1074
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:27,369
 

1075
00:28:26,019 --> 00:28:30,639
 which is becoming getting a lot of

1076
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:30,639
 

1077
00:28:27,369 --> 00:28:32,079
 publicity and carried out such at such

1078
00:28:30,629 --> 00:28:32,079
 

1079
00:28:30,639 --> 00:28:33,819
 an evaluation and there's a lot of

1080
00:28:32,069 --> 00:28:33,819
 

1081
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:36,309
 publicity that it was as good as

1082
00:28:33,809 --> 00:28:36,309
 

1083
00:28:33,819 --> 00:28:38,619
 adopters and that's been quite strongly

1084
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:38,619
 

1085
00:28:36,309 --> 00:28:40,779
 criticized in a very recent paper just a

1086
00:28:38,609 --> 00:28:40,779
 

1087
00:28:38,619 --> 00:28:43,359
 couple of weeks ago in The Lancet in

1088
00:28:40,769 --> 00:28:43,359
 

1089
00:28:40,779 --> 00:28:46,059
 which they take apart this evaluation

1090
00:28:43,349 --> 00:28:46,059
 

1091
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:47,679
 and saying that one of the doctors was

1092
00:28:46,049 --> 00:28:47,679
 

1093
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:50,289
 very bad and that these were selected

1094
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:50,289
 

1095
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:52,299
 cases and there was no no statistical

1096
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:52,299
 

1097
00:28:50,289 --> 00:28:54,219
 testing between them but actually they

1098
00:28:52,289 --> 00:28:54,219
 

1099
00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:56,259
 did say that they were pretty impressed

1100
00:28:54,209 --> 00:28:56,259
 

1101
00:28:54,219 --> 00:28:58,029
 by Babylon and what it could do you know

1102
00:28:56,249 --> 00:28:58,029
 

1103
00:28:56,259 --> 00:29:00,579
 so they and but they're crucial

1104
00:28:58,019 --> 00:29:00,579
 

1105
00:28:58,029 --> 00:29:01,989
 conclusion is that this is only the

1106
00:29:00,569 --> 00:29:01,989
 

1107
00:29:00,579 --> 00:29:04,299
 first phase well actually it's the

1108
00:29:01,979 --> 00:29:04,299
 

1109
00:29:01,989 --> 00:29:05,720
 second phase of the evaluation and we

1110
00:29:04,289 --> 00:29:05,720
 

1111
00:29:04,299 --> 00:29:07,940
 can't know the benefit

1112
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,940
 

1113
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:10,340
 on these systems until we see how it

1114
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:10,340
 

1115
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:12,140
 works in practice in routine practice so

1116
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:12,140
 

1117
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:14,480
 what they were appealing for and they

1118
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:14,480
 

1119
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:16,610
 provide a nice again phased structure

1120
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:16,610
 

1121
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:19,700
 for evaluation is to get on to Phase

1122
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,700
 

1123
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:21,410
 three field testing now this is when it

1124
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:21,410
 

1125
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:24,550
 gets tricky and I'd like to talk about

1126
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,550
 

1127
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:27,470
 some experience I've had in designing a

1128
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:27,470
 

1129
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:29,750
 actual randomized trial of a diagnostic

1130
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,750
 

1131
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:32,480
 aid in medicine it's called a pragmatic

1132
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:32,480
 

1133
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:34,520
 study in statistics we call make a

1134
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,520
 

1135
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,650
 distinguish between an explanatory phase

1136
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:36,650
 

1137
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:38,360
 three study where you tightly control

1138
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,360
 

1139
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:41,030
 everything you make sure everybody does

1140
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:41,030
 

1141
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:42,470
 everything exactly and a pragmatic study

1142
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,470
 

1143
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:45,740
 where you just use essentially just put

1144
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:45,740
 

1145
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:47,630
 it in and see what happens you really

1146
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:47,630
 

1147
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:53,330
 tried to imitate routine practice and

1148
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:53,330
 

1149
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:54,770
 this was a there are we did what's

1150
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,770
 

1151
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:56,930
 called a cluster randomized trial

1152
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,930
 

1153
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:59,180
 because there are alternative study

1154
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,180
 

1155
00:29:56,930 --> 00:30:01,040
 designs we're all used to a/b testing

1156
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:01,040
 

1157
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:02,450
 where you randomize individuals to

1158
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,450
 

1159
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:05,390
 receive different versions of websites

1160
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,390
 

1161
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:06,860
 perhaps so that's fine but actually with

1162
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,860
 

1163
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:08,900
 that with these educate with these

1164
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:08,900
 

1165
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:11,300
 systems algorithms I haven't got an

1166
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,300
 

1167
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:13,160
 educational purpose you're likely to get

1168
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:13,160
 

1169
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:15,080
 contamination people are likely to do

1170
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:15,080
 

1171
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:17,960
 well in the cases whether or not using

1172
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:17,960
 

1173
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:19,670
 the system so we did in the past a

1174
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:19,670
 

1175
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,770
 cluster randomized trial that's where

1176
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,770
 

1177
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:24,380
 you randomized the doctors or the teams

1178
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,380
 

1179
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:25,640
 or the institutions to get the

1180
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:25,640
 

1181
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:27,890
 intervention and that allows for

1182
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:27,890
 

1183
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:30,200
 learning effects and so on and makes you

1184
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,200
 

1185
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:32,180
 realise that a system can benefit people

1186
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:32,180
 

1187
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:35,210
 in more ways than just what it tells

1188
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:35,210
 

1189
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:37,160
 them right in their faces the third

1190
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,160
 

1191
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:39,860
 design which some of you may know about

1192
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:39,860
 

1193
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:41,120
 but is becoming incredibly popular in a

1194
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:41,120
 

1195
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,830
 lot of areas of health care

1196
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,830
 

1197
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:46,490
 interventions is a stepped wedge design

1198
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:46,490
 

1199
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:48,830
 a stepped wedge design is when you roll

1200
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,830
 

1201
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:51,020
 out a piece of technology to different

1202
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,020
 

1203
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:53,540
 sites in a tightly controlled way

1204
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:53,540
 

1205
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:54,890
 essentially you randomize the order of

1206
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:54,890
 

1207
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:57,650
 who gets it first second third fourth

1208
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,650
 

1209
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:59,480
 fifth and every month you put it into a

1210
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,480
 

1211
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:01,280
 new site that's it but you're monitoring

1212
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:01,280
 

1213
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,390
 all the sites at the same time what

1214
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,390
 

1215
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:05,690
 their performance is so you're getting

1216
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:05,690
 

1217
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:07,040
 contemporary balance between people who

1218
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,040
 

1219
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:09,350
 have got it and people who haven't got

1220
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:09,350
 

1221
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:11,390
 it where we're about to carry out one of

1222
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,390
 

1223
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:13,250
 these with one of our systems rolling it

1224
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,250
 

1225
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:15,500
 out to every Center in the UK that's

1226
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,500
 

1227
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:17,030
 doing transplants but they're going to

1228
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:17,030
 

1229
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,510
 get it in a random order there's a

1230
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,510
 

1231
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:20,430
 random order of the road

1232
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,430
 

1233
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:21,690
 so there's a lot of stuff now for each

1234
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,690
 

1235
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:23,310
 of these designs you have to change the

1236
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,310
 

1237
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:25,410
 analysis you have to change the power

1238
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,410
 

1239
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:27,420
 calculations and so on a lot of interest

1240
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,420
 

1241
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:29,520
 in this we did a cluster randomized

1242
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:29,520
 

1243
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:31,620
 trial for acute abdominal pain in which

1244
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:31,620
 

1245
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:34,350
 we randomized 40 doctors over two and a

1246
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:34,350
 

1247
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:37,260
 half years to either get forms either B

1248
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:37,260
 

1249
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:40,200
 control or forms or have the computer or

1250
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:40,200
 

1251
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:43,110
 have computer and feedback it was a

1252
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:43,110
 

1253
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:45,780
 naive Bayes algorithm and actually it

1254
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,780
 

1255
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:47,220
 was rubbish and it really was poor and

1256
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,220
 

1257
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:50,640
 there's the only excuse for this is that

1258
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:50,640
 

1259
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:51,990
 it was back in 1983 that was like common

1260
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:51,990
 

1261
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,630
 I think it was a Commodore it might mean

1262
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:54,630
 

1263
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:57,450
 a really early IBM PC that we put the

1264
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:57,450
 

1265
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:59,070
 thing on and it put lots of patients

1266
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,070
 

1267
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:01,550
 through this but the algorithm really

1268
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,550
 

1269
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:05,400
 wasn't very good it wasn't very accurate

1270
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:05,400
 

1271
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:06,810
 it was grossly overconfident and people

1272
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,810
 

1273
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,130
 didn't use it very much so he filled in

1274
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,130
 

1275
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:09,810
 the forms about two-thirds of the time

1276
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,810
 

1277
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:12,240
 when he used the computer about half the

1278
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,240
 

1279
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:14,520
 time so actually as a system it was a

1280
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,520
 

1281
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,770
 real failure it's sitting there in the

1282
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,770
 

1283
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:20,790
 corner of the A&E department nobody

1284
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,790
 

1285
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:24,300
 liked it but it worked it nearly halved

1286
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:24,300
 

1287
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:26,640
 the number of Admissions and operations

1288
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:26,640
 

1289
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:28,590
 of people who didn't have an organic

1290
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:28,590
 

1291
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,270
 disease with nonspecific abdominal pain

1292
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,270
 

1293
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:31,380
 for whom and our operation was a

1294
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,380
 

1295
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:33,990
 complete waste of time

1296
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:33,990
 

1297
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:36,870
 it nearly half that right in a row and

1298
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,870
 

1299
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:39,480
 this isn't a rigorous design so why did

1300
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:39,480
 

1301
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:41,790
 such a useless bit of junk actually have

1302
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:41,790
 

1303
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:43,350
 an impact and by going back and looking

1304
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,350
 

1305
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:45,180
 very carefully at the trace of what

1306
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,180
 

1307
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:47,580
 happened to people what do you realize

1308
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:47,580
 

1309
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:49,860
 is that the reduction operations was

1310
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,860
 

1311
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:51,690
 completely explained by not intervening

1312
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:51,690
 

1313
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:54,660
 on these people with nonspecific

1314
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,660
 

1315
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:56,790
 abdominal pain and this was because the

1316
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:56,790
 

1317
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:59,790
 junior doctors were making more correct

1318
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:59,790
 

1319
00:32:56,790 --> 00:33:01,560
 confident diagnosis in A&E in the

1320
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,560
 

1321
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:03,750
 emergency room that this patient did not

1322
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,750
 

1323
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:05,580
 have appendicitis or pancreatitis and

1324
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,580
 

1325
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:08,970
 they did this because there was a

1326
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:08,970
 

1327
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:10,710
 cultural change by using the forms the

1328
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,710
 

1329
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:12,540
 computer and the feedback and so on

1330
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,540
 

1331
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:14,850
 there was a cultural change of being

1332
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:14,850
 

1333
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:17,180
 more confident about making an initial

1334
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,180
 

1335
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:20,070
 diagnosis rather than just passing it on

1336
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:20,070
 

1337
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:23,010
 for someone else to decide in wallet and

1338
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:23,010
 

1339
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:26,430
 admitting the patient so and what there

1340
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,430
 

1341
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:27,870
 shows is that when systems go into

1342
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,870
 

1343
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:29,700
 routine use they kind of all sorts of

1344
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,700
 

1345
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:31,500
 unintended side effect and they could

1346
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:31,500
 

1347
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,370
 have unintended benefits but they could

1348
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:32,370
 

1349
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,410
 have unintended harm

1350
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,410
 

1351
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:37,050
 as well which again shows the absolute

1352
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,050
 

1353
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:39,360
 necessity for controlled evaluation

1354
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,360
 

1355
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:40,890
 phase four I won't talk much about and

1356
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,890
 

1357
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,620
 there's a very nice paper by Tate

1358
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,620
 

1359
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:45,600
 shortleaf in a recent JAMA in which he

1360
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:45,600
 

1361
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:47,270
 talks about the need for when your

1362
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,270
 

1363
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,410
 systems are out there being used

1364
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,410
 

1365
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:51,390
 constant surveillance of how they're

1366
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,390
 

1367
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:52,890
 being used for safety for update the

1368
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,890
 

1369
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:56,130
 knowledge base to check about any

1370
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,130
 

1371
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:57,990
 problems etc etc so that's them and not

1372
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,990
 

1373
00:33:56,130 --> 00:34:00,540
 to make sure they are failsafe they're

1374
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,540
 

1375
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:03,090
 not causing harm okay

1376
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:03,090
 

1377
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:06,350
 so let's finish the evaluation part the

1378
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:06,350
 

1379
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:09,570
 phase 1 to phase 4 let's look at

1380
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:09,570
 

1381
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:11,909
 transparency yes look at transparency

1382
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,909
 

1383
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:12,929
 and Nora Neal he's got a lot to say

1384
00:34:11,899 --> 00:34:12,929
 

1385
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:16,129
 about transparency

1386
00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:16,129
 

1387
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:19,320
 she doesn't like transparency yeah

1388
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:19,320
 

1389
00:34:16,129 --> 00:34:22,950
 basically saying you know just

1390
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:22,950
 

1391
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:24,510
 disclosure is not enough you have to be

1392
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,510
 

1393
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:26,940
 you if you're gonna be honest and be

1394
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,940
 

1395
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:28,860
 trustworthy you have to do what she's

1396
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:28,860
 

1397
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:31,110
 called she called intelligent openness

1398
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:31,110
 

1399
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:34,200
 and she wrote this in a Royal Society

1400
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:34,200
 

1401
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:36,240
 report on on on open data now this again

1402
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:36,240
 

1403
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:38,879
 is a lovely list this is this is why you

1404
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:38,879
 

1405
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:41,250
 study Kant for 50 years so you can write

1406
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:41,250
 

1407
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:43,050
 the little list like this if you're

1408
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,050
 

1409
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:44,490
 gonna be intelligent openness if you're

1410
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,490
 

1411
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:45,419
 gonna be intelligently transparent

1412
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,419
 

1413
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:47,370
 you've got to make the information

1414
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:47,370
 

1415
00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:49,320
 accessible people have got to be able to

1416
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,320
 

1417
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:50,639
 get at it it's got to be intelligible

1418
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:50,639
 

1419
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,679
 they've got to be able to understand it

1420
00:34:50,629 --> 00:34:52,679
 

1421
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,540
 it's got to be usable it's got to meet

1422
00:34:52,669 --> 00:34:54,540
 

1423
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:57,090
 their needs and it's got to be

1424
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:57,090
 

1425
00:34:54,540 --> 00:35:00,300
 accessible meaning somebody if they want

1426
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,300
 

1427
00:34:57,090 --> 00:35:02,430
 to should be able to check it somebody

1428
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:02,430
 

1429
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,840
 not everybody but somebody should be

1430
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,840
 

1431
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:05,370
 able to check it now that's a really

1432
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,370
 

1433
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,780
 useful little checklist to have that in

1434
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,780
 

1435
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:09,150
 your mind every time you're thinking

1436
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:09,150
 

1437
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:11,070
 about building an interface or providing

1438
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,070
 

1439
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:12,690
 information have that little list in

1440
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,690
 

1441
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:14,970
 your mind because there are a lot of

1442
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,970
 

1443
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:16,710
 lists around I like in terms of the

1444
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,710
 

1445
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:19,020
 explanation and the accountability I

1446
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,020
 

1447
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:21,150
 like the fat ml one oh why let the fat

1448
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:21,150
 

1449
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:23,400
 ml one that they've come up with these

1450
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,400
 

1451
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:24,980
 five features is that it doesn't include

1452
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:24,980
 

1453
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,940
 transparency

1454
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:26,940
 

1455
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:29,130
 you know they've realized that

1456
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:29,130
 

1457
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:31,260
 transparency just a means to an end it's

1458
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,260
 

1459
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:32,700
 not an end in itself we have to think

1460
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,700
 

1461
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:35,040
 about why do we want to be transparent

1462
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:35,040
 

1463
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:36,690
 what are we doing with that well I think

1464
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,690
 

1465
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,180
 the only thing I think there's missing

1466
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,180
 

1467
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:40,320
 from that is that I do think that you

1468
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,320
 

1469
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:42,540
 know if you're talking about social

1470
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:42,540
 

1471
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,950
 impact you really have to look at impact

1472
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:43,950
 

1473
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,140
 you know what is the harms and benefits

1474
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,140
 

1475
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:47,790
 in practice

1476
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:47,790
 

1477
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:51,000
 so there's one more line I think could

1478
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:51,000
 

1479
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:52,860
 go on there okay we the other thing this

1480
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:52,860
 

1481
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,330
 is a classic thing transparency does not

1482
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,330
 

1483
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:56,280
 necessarily imply into our credibility

1484
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,280
 

1485
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:59,160
 and you know remember back on the

1486
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:59,160
 

1487
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:01,340
 Titanic data I built a complex cart yeah

1488
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:01,340
 

1489
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:03,810
 okay there's a it's very transparent

1490
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:03,810
 

1491
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:07,020
 completely uninterruptible and you know

1492
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,020
 

1493
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:07,530
 in terms of as a as an algorithm okay so

1494
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:07,530
 

1495
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,540
 that's easy

1496
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,540
 

1497
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:11,790
 so explain ability and interpretability

1498
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:11,790
 

1499
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:13,170
 lots of people made lists lots of people

1500
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,170
 

1501
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:15,660
 have talked about this I'm I can only

1502
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,660
 

1503
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:17,940
 just go through some more lists but very

1504
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:17,940
 

1505
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:20,460
 quickly there's usually a distinction

1506
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:20,460
 

1507
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:22,620
 between global and local explain ability

1508
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:22,620
 

1509
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:24,690
 global explain ability is about the

1510
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:24,690
 

1511
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:27,300
 quality of or the trustworthiness of the

1512
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,300
 

1513
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:29,190
 algorithm itself and we're you know in

1514
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:29,190
 

1515
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:31,620
 terms of its empirical basis who has

1516
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:31,620
 

1517
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:34,200
 been tested on can you understand how it

1518
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:34,200
 

1519
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:36,900
 works what in general are the important

1520
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:36,900
 

1521
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,850
 bits of information and you know what I

1522
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:38,850
 

1523
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:40,710
 would add is what are the evaluations

1524
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,710
 

1525
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:42,210
 that have been done on it this is the

1526
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,210
 

1527
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:44,190
 general you know this is a general

1528
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,190
 

1529
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:47,520
 trustworthiness of the algorithm as a

1530
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:47,520
 

1531
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:51,540
 whole the local explain ability is to do

1532
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:51,540
 

1533
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:53,520
 with this particular case okay why was

1534
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:53,520
 

1535
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:55,410
 this conclusion drawn what was the

1536
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:55,410
 

1537
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,810
 tipping points well you know what if the

1538
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,810
 

1539
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:59,720
 expert what if the inputs have been

1540
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,720
 

1541
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:02,700
 different their counterfactual argument

1542
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:02,700
 

1543
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:04,410
 you know is this case actually within

1544
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:04,410
 

1545
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:06,300
 its competence is as an outlier

1546
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,300
 

1547
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:08,310
 can it detect that outlier and how

1548
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,310
 

1549
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:10,110
 confident is that is the conclusion so

1550
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,110
 

1551
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:13,920
 that's to do with the trustworthiness of

1552
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:13,920
 

1553
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:16,440
 of the claim on this case and I think a

1554
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:16,440
 

1555
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,730
 very nice example of from a team that in

1556
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,730
 

1557
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,200
 in Britain that have been developed to

1558
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,200
 

1559
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:20,730
 whom google deepmind working with

1560
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,730
 

1561
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,820
 Moorfields hospital a recent paper in

1562
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,820
 

1563
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:26,580
 nature talk about a system for

1564
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:26,580
 

1565
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:29,520
 essentially interpretating I scan 3d i

1566
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:29,520
 

1567
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:31,710
 scans in order to draw a triage decision

1568
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,710
 

1569
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,030
 and a diagnosis in which they've really

1570
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,030
 

1571
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:35,280
 rather than just going straight for a

1572
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:35,280
 

1573
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:36,810
 probability of a diagnosis they really

1574
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:36,810
 

1575
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,000
 tried showed the intermediate steps

1576
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,000
 

1577
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:41,130
 these segmentation maps where they can

1578
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:41,130
 

1579
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,260
 actually illustrate the chain of reasons

1580
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,260
 

1581
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:44,700
 of led them to even though it's worked

1582
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:44,700
 

1583
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:47,550
 through it you know through run through

1584
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:47,550
 

1585
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:50,460
 deep learning through and that to the

1586
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:50,460
 

1587
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:52,470
 final conclusion so what I'd like to do

1588
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:52,470
 

1589
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:54,270
 now is just illustrate some which show

1590
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,270
 

1591
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:56,130
 you some work we've been doing on an NHS

1592
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,130
 

1593
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:57,440
 predict system and I'm going to see if I

1594
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,440
 

1595
00:37:56,130 --> 00:38:01,010
 can make this work

1596
00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:01,010
 

1597
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:04,040
 and yeah that's different make this work

1598
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,040
 

1599
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:05,599
 okay this is a system for women who've

1600
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:05,599
 

1601
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:07,490
 just been diagnosed with breast cancer

1602
00:38:05,589 --> 00:38:07,490
 

1603
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,410
 and are going to have surgery and have

1604
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,410
 

1605
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:11,650
 to decide about extra treatment they

1606
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,650
 

1607
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:15,530
 might have whether it's chemotherapy or

1608
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:15,530
 

1609
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:17,119
 hormone therapy and so on and we spend a

1610
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,119
 

1611
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:18,440
 lot of time putting a front end on this

1612
00:38:17,109 --> 00:38:18,440
 

1613
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:21,800
 clip you know this algorithm is a

1614
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:21,800
 

1615
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:22,849
 statistical algorithm bit and put in a

1616
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:22,849
 

1617
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,560
 front end and doing a lot of user

1618
00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:24,560
 

1619
00:38:22,849 --> 00:38:26,480
 testing working with psychology

1620
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:26,480
 

1621
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,339
 psychologists etc and the whole idea

1622
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,339
 

1623
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:31,760
 about this is that it's used by doctors

1624
00:38:28,329 --> 00:38:31,760
 

1625
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:33,050
 in a group to make to decide what they

1626
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,050
 

1627
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,849
 think should be recommended to the

1628
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,849
 

1629
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:37,760
 patient but increasing it's being used

1630
00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:37,760
 

1631
00:38:34,849 --> 00:38:40,190
 in the discussion with the patient when

1632
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:40,190
 

1633
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,510
 we're talking about and I've known you

1634
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,510
 

1635
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:43,250
 know friends of mine have used this

1636
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,250
 

1637
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:45,349
 device in order to argue back against

1638
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,349
 

1639
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:47,180
 the doctors saying I don't want that the

1640
00:38:45,339 --> 00:38:47,180
 

1641
00:38:45,349 --> 00:38:49,550
 benefit is not big enough to for me to

1642
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:49,550
 

1643
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:50,780
 put up with the side-effects and so it

1644
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,780
 

1645
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:52,760
 is actually I think we're hoping this

1646
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:52,760
 

1647
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:54,619
 would be empowering to women to make

1648
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,619
 

1649
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:56,240
 drawing their conclusions so basically

1650
00:38:54,609 --> 00:38:56,240
 

1651
00:38:54,619 --> 00:38:58,099
 you know you put in your data in the

1652
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:58,099
 

1653
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,839
 usual sort of way and decide what

1654
00:38:58,089 --> 00:38:59,839
 

1655
00:38:58,099 --> 00:39:01,640
 treatments you might like or the

1656
00:38:59,829 --> 00:39:01,640
 

1657
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:04,730
 treatment Passa the possible treatments

1658
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:04,730
 

1659
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:07,040
 and then it presents the results in many

1660
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,040
 

1661
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:09,170
 different ways because the psychological

1662
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:09,170
 

1663
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:12,650
 research shows there is no correct way

1664
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,650
 

1665
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:15,560
 of explaining what the predictions are

1666
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,560
 

1667
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:18,050
 on this individual there's no correct

1668
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:18,050
 

1669
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:19,700
 way to do it one size does not fit all

1670
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,700
 

1671
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:21,619
 you've got very different preferences

1672
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,619
 

1673
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:24,589
 depending on people's numerical or

1674
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:24,589
 

1675
00:39:21,619 --> 00:39:26,660
 verbal or graphical skills so which

1676
00:39:24,579 --> 00:39:26,660
 

1677
00:39:24,589 --> 00:39:28,310
 provide a lot you can choose what you

1678
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:28,310
 

1679
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:29,869
 want the doctors like just like a table

1680
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,869
 

1681
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:31,609
 because that's very simple for them to

1682
00:39:29,859 --> 00:39:31,609
 

1683
00:39:29,869 --> 00:39:33,380
 use when their own discussion of what

1684
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,380
 

1685
00:39:31,609 --> 00:39:35,599
 would be the additional 10-year benefit

1686
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:35,599
 

1687
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:38,960
 we could do 15 years but 10-year benefit

1688
00:39:35,589 --> 00:39:38,960
 

1689
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:41,780
 from 64% survival goes up to 81% if they

1690
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:41,780
 

1691
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:44,660
 have all the treatments and there's lots

1692
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:44,660
 

1693
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:47,569
 of helps you know lots of help commands

1694
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:47,569
 

1695
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:49,490
 all over the place okay but some people

1696
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:49,490
 

1697
00:39:47,569 --> 00:39:50,990
 like survival curves people we've done

1698
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,990
 

1699
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:52,819
 experiments people can understand

1700
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,819
 

1701
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:54,619
 survival curves it with good with good

1702
00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:54,619
 

1703
00:39:52,819 --> 00:39:56,690
 annotation and a bit of help and support

1704
00:39:54,609 --> 00:39:56,690
 

1705
00:39:54,619 --> 00:39:58,040
 it can understand survival because the

1706
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,040
 

1707
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:59,660
 interesting thing about this one and

1708
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,660
 

1709
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:02,510
 what is quite this is the end of one of

1710
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:02,510
 

1711
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:07,130
 the innovations is to put in the dashed

1712
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:07,130
 

1713
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:08,110
 line look yep you're not seeing any of

1714
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,110
 

1715
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:10,850
 this

1716
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,850
 

1717
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:14,570
 I'm bashing away and you're not seeing

1718
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:14,570
 

1719
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:17,270
 any of it oh and what a wasted sir

1720
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,270
 

1721
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:19,130
 didn't anyone tell me okay sorry right

1722
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,130
 

1723
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:21,770
 I'm gonna have to I can't do it I

1724
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,770
 

1725
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:24,200
 realized that the thing is just working

1726
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,200
 

1727
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:26,660
 off PowerPoint okay if you just excuse

1728
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:26,660
 

1729
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:28,430

00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:28,430
 

1731
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:30,500
 sorry someone should have them let me

1732
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:30,500
 

1733
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:40,970
 know about that I have got some side

1734
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:40,970
 

1735
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:43,040
 have some slides and I hope babe I beg

1736
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,040
 

1737
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:43,430
 your pardon right okay bugger bugger

1738
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:43,430
 

1739
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,550
 bugger

1740
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:46,550
 

1741
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:48,650
 I'm sorry pardon my language okay just a

1742
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:48,650
 

1743
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:50,330
 moment just a moment

1744
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,330
 

1745
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:56,240
 yes that's what I wanted to be showing

1746
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:56,240
 

1747
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:58,130
 you yes right thank you thank you come

1748
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:58,130
 

1749
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,990
 on you got to tell me tell me oh I'm

1750
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,990
 

1751
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:02,390
 slugging my guts I doubt it up here

1752
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:02,390
 

1753
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:05,150
 nothing so that's the table the people

1754
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:05,150
 

1755
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:06,650
 see survival curves you can see the nice

1756
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:06,650
 

1757
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:08,690
 thing about that the dashed line shows

1758
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,690
 

1759
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:10,670
 what would be the survival and for

1760
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,670
 

1761
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:12,260
 someone who is cured in others what's

1762
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,260
 

1763
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:14,780
 that's the best you can do best you can

1764
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:14,780
 

1765
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:16,130
 hope for and so what you can see is that

1766
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:16,130
 

1767
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:18,590
 all those treatments take up a lot of

1768
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,590
 

1769
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:21,980
 the slack before that to bar charts

1770
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:21,980
 

1771
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:24,140
 nicely annotated text of what does it

1772
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:24,140
 

1773
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:26,660
 mean for 100 people known to be a very

1774
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:26,660
 

1775
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:28,700
 good way to communicate risk and finally

1776
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,700
 

1777
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:30,980
 and this is one we thought patients

1778
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:30,980
 

1779
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:33,170
 wouldn't like the icon array what does

1780
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:33,170
 

1781
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:36,020
 it mean for a hundred people like you in

1782
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,020
 

1783
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:37,430
 10 years time and what the patients

1784
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:37,430
 

1785
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:40,400
 didn't like is when these were little

1786
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:40,400
 

1787
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:43,010
 people particularly particularly when

1788
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:43,010
 

1789
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:46,040
 the deaths were big black were black

1790
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,040
 

1791
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:48,320
 little people so we've dehumanized it

1792
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:48,320
 

1793
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:49,880
 and D colored the deaths this is the

1794
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:49,880
 

1795
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:52,610
 only place in the whole program that

1796
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:52,610
 

1797
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:54,380
 word death is mentioned everything else

1798
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,380
 

1799
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:55,010
 is positively framed in terms of

1800
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:55,010
 

1801
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:59,870
 survival

1802
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,870
 

1803
00:41:55,010 --> 00:42:01,310
 so a okay so that's one of the the

1804
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,310
 

1805
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:03,650
 things that's in there and we can put

1806
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,650
 

1807
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:08,750
 uncertainty on the benefits if you want

1808
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:08,750
 

1809
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:11,180
 to you can get some explanation from

1810
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:11,180
 

1811
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:14,000
 tables the explanation isn't isn't great

1812
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:14,000
 

1813
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:15,950
 but and we could do some more work on

1814
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,950
 

1815
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,830
 that but you can do some explanation on

1816
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:18,830
 

1817
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:20,700
 that okay so let's go back to where I

1818
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,700
 

1819
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:23,280
 was fortunately I did have some or

1820
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:23,280
 

1821
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:27,650
 prepared always be always be cautious in

1822
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:27,650
 

1823
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:34,020
 that way um yum-yum-yum where are we um

1824
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:34,020
 

1825
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:35,550
 yeah okay so yeah so that's it and this

1826
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:35,550
 

1827
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:37,560
 got about thirty thousand users a month

1828
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,560
 

1829
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:38,820
 it's incredibly popular around the

1830
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:38,820
 

1831
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,470
 worlds about half of those and in North

1832
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:40,470
 

1833
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:42,240
 America half in Britain Australia

1834
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:42,240
 

1835
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:44,160
 whatever and we're about to start a

1836
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:44,160
 

1837
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:47,040
 phase three trial of supplying

1838
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:47,040
 

1839
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:49,050
 side-effect information it's already in

1840
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:49,050
 

1841
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,550
 use the things so it's quite difficult

1842
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,550
 

1843
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:52,560
 to do Studies on it and we're launching

1844
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,560
 

1845
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:56,510
 versions for prostate cancer kidney

1846
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:56,510
 

1847
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:58,829
 heart and lung transplants explanation

1848
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,829
 

1849
00:42:56,510 --> 00:43:00,660
 there's lots of explanation the main

1850
00:42:58,819 --> 00:43:00,660
 

1851
00:42:58,829 --> 00:43:02,820
 explanation is the counterfactuals the

1852
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:02,820
 

1853
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:03,900
 fact how easy it is to change the inputs

1854
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:03,900
 

1855
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:06,780
 and see how the outputs change

1856
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:06,780
 

1857
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:09,150
 immediately so that is just the ease of

1858
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:09,150
 

1859
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:10,710
 use and the attractiveness of use is is

1860
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:10,710
 

1861
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:12,510
 very important but then we've got text

1862
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,510
 

1863
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:14,369
 and tables you could download the maths

1864
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,369
 

1865
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:16,260
 of PDF nobody ever does that

1866
00:43:14,359 --> 00:43:16,260
 

1867
00:43:14,369 --> 00:43:18,089
 I think you know the and we can get the

1868
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:18,089
 

1869
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,650
 code it's all open source as well and

1870
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:19,650
 

1871
00:43:18,089 --> 00:43:21,119
 these are for very different audiences

1872
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,119
 

1873
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:23,040
 if you want to see the all of competing

1874
00:43:21,109 --> 00:43:23,040
 

1875
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:25,530
 risk model you can there's as part of it

1876
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:25,530
 

1877
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:27,510
 and nobody ever looks at that okay and

1878
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,510
 

1879
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:30,839
 so what I actually one thing I should

1880
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:30,839
 

1881
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:33,630
 mention referencing the talk before is

1882
00:43:30,829 --> 00:43:33,630
 

1883
00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:36,180
 that this has got so attractive I think

1884
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:36,180
 

1885
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:37,530
 we're suffering from over trust is that

1886
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:37,530
 

1887
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,849
 people who actually believe this is the

1888
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,849
 

1889
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:41,460
 truth what's going to happen to them and

1890
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:41,460
 

1891
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:43,349
 of course it's not it's not this is very

1892
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:43,349
 

1893
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:44,400
 it's really quite crude I'm sure you

1894
00:43:43,339 --> 00:43:44,400
 

1895
00:43:43,349 --> 00:43:46,020
 could build algorithms that would

1896
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:46,020
 

1897
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,579
 improve on it a little bit particularly

1898
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:47,579
 

1899
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:49,470
 the access to more data more data

1900
00:43:47,569 --> 00:43:49,470
 

1901
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:51,630
 there's lots of features that are not in

1902
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,630
 

1903
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:52,800
 there so it's very dangerous to make it

1904
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:52,800
 

1905
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:54,390
 almost we've got to be really careful

1906
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:54,390
 

1907
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:58,020
 not to pick people believe it too much

1908
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:58,020
 

1909
00:43:54,390 --> 00:44:01,020
 ok interpretability lots of just general

1910
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:01,020
 

1911
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:03,390
 comments variety of audiences of course

1912
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:03,390
 

1913
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:05,400
 there's no single way to do it there's

1914
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:05,400
 

1915
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:08,190
 some maybe some increasing legal demands

1916
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:08,190
 

1917
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:10,650
 or that's not quite clear and you need

1918
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:10,650
 

1919
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:13,560
 to properly evaluate explanations they

1920
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,560
 

1921
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:14,910
 may confuse or mislead and there's all

1922
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:14,910
 

1923
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:16,410
 sorts of really clever stuff you know

1924
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,410
 

1925
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:18,210
 about being done about surrogate so

1926
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,210
 

1927
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:19,619
 explaining black boxes well the other

1928
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,619
 

1929
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:21,150
 thing is the other option of course is

1930
00:44:19,609 --> 00:44:21,150
 

1931
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:23,430
 do you build an interpreter model in the

1932
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:23,430
 

1933
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:26,010
 first place and not bother with a

1934
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:26,010
 

1935
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:27,900
 complex model and of course and in

1936
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,900
 

1937
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:29,069
 regression models under are you know

1938
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:29,069
 

1939
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,599
 apparently are supposed to be

1940
00:44:29,059 --> 00:44:30,599
 

1941
00:44:29,069 --> 00:44:32,640
 interpreted ball because scoring is

1942
00:44:30,589 --> 00:44:32,640
 

1943
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:33,950
 interpretive all sort of nice risk

1944
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:33,950
 

1945
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,440
 scoring work

1946
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:36,440
 

1947
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:39,349
 and being done on generalize article out

1948
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:39,349
 

1949
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:41,900
 of an additive models optimizing

1950
00:44:39,339 --> 00:44:41,900
 

1951
00:44:39,349 --> 00:44:43,760
 integers to produce indices such as that

1952
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:43,760
 

1953
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:47,150
 just based on integer scoring very

1954
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:47,150
 

1955
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:51,579
 simple explainable outputs and what's

1956
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:51,579
 

1957
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:54,680
 interesting because it's how you know

1958
00:44:51,569 --> 00:44:54,680
 

1959
00:44:51,579 --> 00:44:57,230
 what class of problems will this work in

1960
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:57,230
 

1961
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:58,430
 what class of problems is it possible to

1962
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:58,430
 

1963
00:44:57,230 --> 00:45:00,589
 construct an algorithm that's

1964
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:00,589
 

1965
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:02,359
 essentially not significantly different

1966
00:45:00,579 --> 00:45:02,359
 

1967
00:45:00,589 --> 00:45:03,890
 in terms of its accuracy and its

1968
00:45:02,349 --> 00:45:03,890
 

1969
00:45:02,359 --> 00:45:06,680
 performance and yet has a much more

1970
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,680
 

1971
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:08,390
 interpretable format I think that's an

1972
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:08,390
 

1973
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:10,010
 important issue just to point it Alan

1974
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:10,010
 

1975
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:12,650
 Turing across the approach to listen

1976
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,650
 

1977
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:14,450
 explanation and he he when he was

1978
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,450
 

1979
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:14,809
 breaking the Enigma codes in the Second

1980
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:14,809
 

1981
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:17,119
 World War

1982
00:45:14,799 --> 00:45:17,119
 

1983
00:45:14,809 --> 00:45:18,380
 used weights of evidence as his main way

1984
00:45:17,109 --> 00:45:18,380
 

1985
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:20,780
 of communication which the log

1986
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:20,780
 

1987
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:22,579
 likelihood ratios using a naive Bayes

1988
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:22,579
 

1989
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:25,190
 model and Jack good promoted these in

1990
00:45:22,569 --> 00:45:25,190
 

1991
00:45:22,579 --> 00:45:30,109
 the 1950s so these are essentially um

1992
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:30,109
 

1993
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:31,670
 you know additive forms of scores the

1994
00:45:30,099 --> 00:45:31,670
 

1995
00:45:30,109 --> 00:45:34,190
 attractive thing about that and you saw

1996
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:34,190
 

1997
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:35,329
 that in Cynthia Rudin's model before is

1998
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:35,329
 

1999
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:38,329
 that you can have positive and negative

2000
00:45:35,319 --> 00:45:38,329
 

2001
00:45:35,329 --> 00:45:39,319
 scores and positive and negative scores

2002
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:39,319
 

2003
00:45:38,329 --> 00:45:40,609
 are very nice because you've got this

2004
00:45:39,309 --> 00:45:40,609
 

2005
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:42,710
 sort of account you can see what's

2006
00:45:40,599 --> 00:45:42,710
 

2007
00:45:40,609 --> 00:45:44,960
 evidence for hypothesis and evidence

2008
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:44,960
 

2009
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:46,760
 against and so you know we did some work

2010
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,760
 

2011
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,319
 ages ago where and a system for

2012
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:48,319
 

2013
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:50,630
 diagnosing dispense yeah you know

2014
00:45:48,309 --> 00:45:50,630
 

2015
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:52,400
 stomach problems where you could see the

2016
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:52,400
 

2017
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:54,349
 evidence for peptic ulcer and evidence

2018
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:54,349
 

2019
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,000
 against the peptic ulcer and these just

2020
00:45:54,339 --> 00:45:56,000
 

2021
00:45:54,349 --> 00:45:58,549
 add up there's a logistic regression

2022
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:58,549
 

2023
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,619
 normalized and you end up with a total

2024
00:45:58,539 --> 00:46:00,619
 

2025
00:45:58,549 --> 00:46:02,480
 probability of 68 percent chance they

2026
00:46:00,609 --> 00:46:02,480
 

2027
00:46:00,619 --> 00:46:04,790
 got a peptic ulcer and that's well

2028
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:04,790
 

2029
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,170
 calibrated and mean six tips and but

2030
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:06,170
 

2031
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:07,549
 it's a very simple thing to explain

2032
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,549
 

2033
00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:11,270
 because you can see a positive negative

2034
00:46:07,539 --> 00:46:11,270
 

2035
00:46:07,549 --> 00:46:13,630
 account of what's going on now just

2036
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:13,630
 

2037
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:15,920
 briefly I've got two final little themes

2038
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:15,920
 

2039
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:17,510
 communicating uncertainty I know

2040
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:17,510
 

2041
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,130
 statisticians are obsessed about

2042
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,130
 

2043
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:22,849
 uncertainty the second order properties

2044
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:22,849
 

2045
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:25,190
 and getting it right and and and very

2046
00:46:22,839 --> 00:46:25,190
 

2047
00:46:22,849 --> 00:46:26,420
 nice to see in the fat ml guidelines to

2048
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:26,420
 

2049
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:27,980
 determine how to communicate the

2050
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:27,980
 

2051
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:29,660
 uncertainty margin of error of each

2052
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:29,660
 

2053
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:31,490
 decision I'm getting a slit again

2054
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:31,490
 

2055
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:34,220
 slightly off track but not apologizing

2056
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:34,220
 

2057
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:35,720
 into general communicating uncertainty

2058
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:35,720
 

2059
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:37,819
 because there's a part of

2060
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:37,819
 

2061
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:40,190
 trustworthiness to acknowledge that we

2062
00:46:37,809 --> 00:46:40,190
 

2063
00:46:37,819 --> 00:46:42,170
 don't know but there's an anxiety that

2064
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:42,170
 

2065
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:44,450
 if we admit we don't know will people

2066
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,450
 

2067
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:46,309
 believe us will they say oh no our gun

2068
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,309
 

2069
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:47,690
 talk to someone who does know you know

2070
00:46:46,299 --> 00:46:47,690
 

2071
00:46:46,309 --> 00:46:50,030
 in politics or something

2072
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,030
 

2073
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:52,940
 that's and and we're faced with that you

2074
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:52,940
 

2075
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:56,180
 know routinely even from very good

2076
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:56,180
 

2077
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:58,250
 sources and here's the BBC in January

2078
00:46:56,170 --> 00:46:58,250
 

2079
00:46:56,180 --> 00:47:00,530
 this year saying that unemployment in

2080
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,530
 

2081
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:02,869
 the UK had gone down by three thousand

2082
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:02,869
 

2083
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:05,720
 is that a trustworthy number

2084
00:47:02,859 --> 00:47:05,720
 

2085
00:47:02,869 --> 00:47:07,670
 it's from the BBC it's from its from the

2086
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:07,670
 

2087
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:09,680
 Office of National Statistics surely we

2088
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:09,680
 

2089
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:11,720
 can believe that number well if we go

2090
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:11,720
 

2091
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:14,780
 down and dig hard and you have to dig

2092
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:14,780
 

2093
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:17,359
 very hard into the website into a into a

2094
00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:17,359
 

2095
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:19,670
 small set into a big slab of text we

2096
00:47:17,349 --> 00:47:19,670
 

2097
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:25,609
 find out that the margin of error on

2098
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:25,609
 

2099
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:28,160
 that number is plus or minus 77,000 well

2100
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:28,160
 

2101
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:29,480
 actually no we can't believe that number

2102
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:29,480
 

2103
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:32,960
 it's might have gone up if I'd have gone

2104
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:32,960
 

2105
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:35,690
 down we haven't got a clue so that is

2106
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:35,690
 

2107
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:37,430
 not a trustworthy communication the

2108
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,430
 

2109
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:39,589
 uncertainty is not being acknowledged

2110
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:39,589
 

2111
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:41,270
 compared with the Bank of England when

2112
00:47:39,579 --> 00:47:41,270
 

2113
00:47:39,589 --> 00:47:43,220
 it does its communication it's full of

2114
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:43,220
 

2115
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:46,040
 uncertainty these fan charts indicate

2116
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:46,040
 

2117
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:47,720
 thirty and sixty nine percent chances or

2118
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,720
 

2119
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:49,760
 what might happen in the future and what

2120
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:49,760
 

2121
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:50,869
 GDP might or growth might have been in

2122
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:50,869
 

2123
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,980
 the past they don't know what's going to

2124
00:47:50,859 --> 00:47:51,980
 

2125
00:47:50,869 --> 00:47:53,060
 happen in the future they don't know

2126
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:53,060
 

2127
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:54,170
 what's happening at the moment and they

2128
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:54,170
 

2129
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:55,819
 haven't got much of a clue what happened

2130
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,819
 

2131
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:56,390
 in the past and they're really honest

2132
00:47:55,809 --> 00:47:56,390
 

2133
00:47:55,819 --> 00:47:58,700
 about it

2134
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:58,700
 

2135
00:47:56,390 --> 00:48:02,150
 no really upfront and that's the Bank of

2136
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:02,150
 

2137
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:04,640
 England we're now working on migration

2138
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:04,640
 

2139
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:09,589
 statistics we thought we'd pick an area

2140
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:09,589
 

2141
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:11,630
 where that wasn't very contested so yeah

2142
00:48:09,579 --> 00:48:11,630
 

2143
00:48:09,589 --> 00:48:13,010
 so we're working with the Office of

2144
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:13,010
 

2145
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:14,599
 National Statistics on Niagara and if

2146
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,599
 

2147
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:16,430
 you looked at the last report that came

2148
00:48:14,589 --> 00:48:16,430
 

2149
00:48:14,599 --> 00:48:20,020
 out a couple of weeks ago that is the

2150
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:20,020
 

2151
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:22,130
 display it's what we call a fuzzy fan

2152
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:22,130
 

2153
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:23,599
 not a straight line it they used to be

2154
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,599
 

2155
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:25,640
 just straight lines to display the

2156
00:48:23,589 --> 00:48:25,640
 

2157
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:27,200
 uncertainty on the migration statistics

2158
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:27,200
 

2159
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:28,640
 going down very well we're doing

2160
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:28,640
 

2161
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:30,109
 randomized trials to see whether people

2162
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:30,109
 

2163
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:32,150
 can understand it whether they like it

2164
00:48:30,099 --> 00:48:32,150
 

2165
00:48:30,109 --> 00:48:33,680
 or whatever and it's still inadequate

2166
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:33,680
 

2167
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:35,150
 because that's only the quantified

2168
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:35,150
 

2169
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,950
 uncertainty there's all the other

2170
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:36,950
 

2171
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:39,440
 sources of error that are not taken into

2172
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:39,440
 

2173
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:40,190
 account yet so I think communicating of

2174
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:40,190
 

2175
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,920
 uncertainty

2176
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:42,920
 

2177
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:45,490
 you know our empirical research suggests

2178
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:45,490
 

2179
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:48,680
 that confident uncertainty what I call

2180
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:48,680
 

2181
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:51,200
 muscular uncertainty I'm uncertain what

2182
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:51,200
 

2183
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:52,670
 are you gonna do about it no we got to

2184
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:52,670
 

2185
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,619
 be confident with our uncertainty and

2186
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:54,619
 

2187
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:56,300
 that that does not reduce trust and

2188
00:48:54,609 --> 00:48:56,300
 

2189
00:48:54,619 --> 00:48:57,880
 credibility people expect it people are

2190
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:57,880
 

2191
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:59,839
 not stupid

2192
00:48:57,870 --> 00:48:59,839
 

2193
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:01,019
 now what's the relevance to this

2194
00:48:59,829 --> 00:49:01,019
 

2195
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:02,579
 audience the point

2196
00:49:01,009 --> 00:49:02,579
 

2197
00:49:01,019 --> 00:49:04,109
 in the past official statistics were

2198
00:49:02,569 --> 00:49:04,109
 

2199
00:49:02,579 --> 00:49:06,479
 based on big surveys that is all

2200
00:49:04,099 --> 00:49:06,479
 

2201
00:49:04,109 --> 00:49:07,679
 changing in the future official

2202
00:49:06,469 --> 00:49:07,679
 

2203
00:49:06,479 --> 00:49:10,709
 statistics going to be increasingly

2204
00:49:07,669 --> 00:49:10,709
 

2205
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:11,849
 based on scraping routine data from all

2206
00:49:10,699 --> 00:49:11,849
 

2207
00:49:10,709 --> 00:49:13,919
 over the place and there's going to be

2208
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:13,919
 

2209
00:49:11,849 --> 00:49:16,409
 lots more uncertainty coming into that

2210
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:16,409
 

2211
00:49:13,919 --> 00:49:18,359
 and so I think this is an area where

2212
00:49:16,399 --> 00:49:18,359
 

2213
00:49:16,409 --> 00:49:20,999
 this community really needs to take some

2214
00:49:18,349 --> 00:49:20,999
 

2215
00:49:18,359 --> 00:49:23,819
 notice of okay very finely oh yeah great

2216
00:49:20,989 --> 00:49:23,819
 

2217
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:25,019
 Oh finally I got time fairness fairness

2218
00:49:23,809 --> 00:49:25,019
 

2219
00:49:23,819 --> 00:49:28,709
 I wasn't going to talk about fairness

2220
00:49:25,009 --> 00:49:28,709
 

2221
00:49:25,019 --> 00:49:30,469
 but I recently had a real example of of

2222
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:30,469
 

2223
00:49:28,709 --> 00:49:32,729
 a situation where a group of people

2224
00:49:30,459 --> 00:49:32,729
 

2225
00:49:30,469 --> 00:49:36,989
 really complained about an algorithm

2226
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:36,989
 

2227
00:49:32,729 --> 00:49:38,669
 said this is not fair okay this crude

2228
00:49:36,979 --> 00:49:38,669
 

2229
00:49:36,989 --> 00:49:41,069
 this was to do with an algorithm about

2230
00:49:38,659 --> 00:49:41,069
 

2231
00:49:38,669 --> 00:49:42,989
 heart age if you google anyone's got a

2232
00:49:41,059 --> 00:49:42,989
 

2233
00:49:41,069 --> 00:49:45,149
 laptop over but if you have google heart

2234
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:45,149
 

2235
00:49:42,989 --> 00:49:47,849
 age UK and you'll come across this

2236
00:49:45,139 --> 00:49:47,849
 

2237
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:50,130
 algorithm that was recently relaunched

2238
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:50,130
 

2239
00:49:47,849 --> 00:49:52,469
 and was incredibly popular got a huge

2240
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,469
 

2241
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:54,390
 amount of publicity so there it is and

2242
00:49:52,459 --> 00:49:54,390
 

2243
00:49:52,469 --> 00:49:56,130
 you put a usual stuff you put in your

2244
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:56,130
 

2245
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:59,279
 your ages and things like that I'm

2246
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:59,279
 

2247
00:49:56,130 --> 00:50:03,929
 actually 65 and it told me my heart was

2248
00:49:59,269 --> 00:50:03,929
 

2249
00:49:59,279 --> 00:50:06,029
 69 so and that's what and nearly

2250
00:50:03,919 --> 00:50:06,029
 

2251
00:50:03,929 --> 00:50:08,669
 everybody it tells them their half is

2252
00:50:06,019 --> 00:50:08,669
 

2253
00:50:06,029 --> 00:50:12,329
 older than they and they people this

2254
00:50:08,659 --> 00:50:12,329
 

2255
00:50:08,669 --> 00:50:14,009
 really annoyed people and now what is

2256
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:14,009
 

2257
00:50:12,329 --> 00:50:16,499
 the idea behind this idea of it what

2258
00:50:13,999 --> 00:50:16,499
 

2259
00:50:14,009 --> 00:50:17,909
 what called effective age of your organs

2260
00:50:16,489 --> 00:50:17,909
 

2261
00:50:16,499 --> 00:50:19,769
 there's lots of things if you go online

2262
00:50:17,899 --> 00:50:19,769
 

2263
00:50:17,909 --> 00:50:22,139
 you can find your lung age your brain

2264
00:50:19,759 --> 00:50:22,139
 

2265
00:50:19,769 --> 00:50:23,969
 age everything your real age everybody

2266
00:50:22,129 --> 00:50:23,969
 

2267
00:50:22,139 --> 00:50:26,339
 tries to tell you that it's actually a

2268
00:50:23,959 --> 00:50:26,339
 

2269
00:50:23,969 --> 00:50:29,279
 very rigorous way to communicate risk

2270
00:50:26,329 --> 00:50:29,279
 

2271
00:50:26,339 --> 00:50:30,989
 actually quite like it it tells you what

2272
00:50:29,269 --> 00:50:30,989
 

2273
00:50:29,279 --> 00:50:32,549
 is the age of a healthy person and

2274
00:50:30,979 --> 00:50:32,549
 

2275
00:50:30,989 --> 00:50:34,349
 somebody else defines what the healthy

2276
00:50:32,539 --> 00:50:34,349
 

2277
00:50:32,549 --> 00:50:37,319
 person is who is the same risk function

2278
00:50:34,339 --> 00:50:37,319
 

2279
00:50:34,349 --> 00:50:40,169
 as you so basically if you've got your

2280
00:50:37,309 --> 00:50:40,169
 

2281
00:50:37,319 --> 00:50:42,509
 age and your risk and then there's a

2282
00:50:40,159 --> 00:50:42,509
 

2283
00:50:40,169 --> 00:50:45,269
 trajectory of a healthy person and their

2284
00:50:42,499 --> 00:50:45,269
 

2285
00:50:42,509 --> 00:50:47,579
 risk profile you map along and find out

2286
00:50:45,259 --> 00:50:47,579
 

2287
00:50:45,269 --> 00:50:49,439
 what how old a healthy person would be

2288
00:50:47,569 --> 00:50:49,439
 

2289
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:51,259
 who had the same risk as you and in this

2290
00:50:49,429 --> 00:50:51,259
 

2291
00:50:49,439 --> 00:50:54,269
 case is older than you are

2292
00:50:51,249 --> 00:50:54,269
 

2293
00:50:51,259 --> 00:50:57,719
 this heart idea of heart age has been

2294
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:57,719
 

2295
00:50:54,269 --> 00:51:01,079
 subject to phase three evaluation not

2296
00:50:57,709 --> 00:51:01,079
 

2297
00:50:57,719 --> 00:51:03,419
 just phase 1 phase 2 phase 3 evaluation

2298
00:51:01,069 --> 00:51:03,419
 

2299
00:51:01,079 --> 00:51:06,239
 in a randomized trial in Spain in which

2300
00:51:03,409 --> 00:51:06,239
 

2301
00:51:03,419 --> 00:51:08,849
 3,000 subjects were Randol simple

2302
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,849
 

2303
00:51:06,239 --> 00:51:10,409
 randomization and to either get the

2304
00:51:08,839 --> 00:51:10,409
 

2305
00:51:08,849 --> 00:51:12,389
 heart age calculator Framingham risk

2306
00:51:10,399 --> 00:51:12,389
 

2307
00:51:10,409 --> 00:51:14,189
 score control and they found out that

2308
00:51:12,379 --> 00:51:14,189
 

2309
00:51:12,389 --> 00:51:14,580
 after a year the people had got the

2310
00:51:14,179 --> 00:51:14,580
 

2311
00:51:14,189 --> 00:51:16,530
 heart

2312
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:16,530
 

2313
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:18,030
 Paige had done more had improved their

2314
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,030
 

2315
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:18,810
 behavior most their risk scores had gone

2316
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:18,810
 

2317
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:22,200
 down the most

2318
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,200
 

2319
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:24,600
 so quite Rou nice nice evaluation now

2320
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:24,600
 

2321
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:26,670
 when this came out I started receiving

2322
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:26,670
 

2323
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:28,140
 emails because I'm interested people

2324
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:28,140
 

2325
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:30,000
 knew I was interested in this sort of

2326
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:30,000
 

2327
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:34,050
 stuff so my esteemed colleagues one said

2328
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:34,050
 

2329
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,640
 what a load of from a maths professor it

2330
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,640
 

2331
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:37,800
 just annoys me that since I've raised

2332
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:37,800
 

2333
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:39,480
 risk factors when I've done BBC producer

2334
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:39,480
 

2335
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:41,130
 what other actually I think I've got to

2336
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:41,130
 

2337
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:43,140
 say this what other bollocks this whole

2338
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,140
 

2339
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:44,820
 thing is in my lose in the translation

2340
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:44,820
 

2341
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:45,210
 but I think you get the gist what that's

2342
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:45,210
 

2343
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:48,060
 about

2344
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,060
 

2345
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:49,680
 that was from a doctor I could have a I

2346
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:49,680
 

2347
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:51,270
 could have program this in my sleep just

2348
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:51,270
 

2349
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:54,240
 a load of random numbers designed to

2350
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:54,240
 

2351
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:56,310
 people off okay so this is what mica

2352
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:56,310
 

2353
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:59,790
 this was a random sample of my

2354
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:59,790
 

2355
00:51:56,310 --> 00:52:01,800
 colleagues thought they had something in

2356
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:01,800
 

2357
00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:04,320
 common they were all fit and healthy

2358
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:04,320
 

2359
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:06,990
 middle-aged white men now this is not a

2360
00:52:04,310 --> 00:52:06,990
 

2361
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:09,090
 group we normally feel very sorry for to

2362
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:09,090
 

2363
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:11,510
 be honest you know this is not I would

2364
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:11,510
 

2365
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:17,280
 not consider this a persecuted minority

2366
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:17,280
 

2367
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:19,290
 so why were they so annoyed they were

2368
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:19,290
 

2369
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,580
 all given older hearts they thought

2370
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,580
 

2371
00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:22,050
 they'd put their things and it'll tell

2372
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,050
 

2373
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:24,810
 them how healthy they were and then it

2374
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,810
 

2375
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:26,610
 told them their hearts were old the

2376
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,610
 

2377
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:28,950
 point is what was seen is not fair is

2378
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:28,950
 

2379
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:31,590
 that there's no question about how thick

2380
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:31,590
 

2381
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:33,720
 you are how much exercise you take and

2382
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:33,720
 

2383
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:36,200
 they know that is an important factor

2384
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:36,200
 

2385
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:38,490
 these are all men who went jogging and

2386
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:38,490
 

2387
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:40,550
 and it still told them they were old and

2388
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,550
 

2389
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:44,370
 crummy don't so they got so angry

2390
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:44,370
 

2391
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:47,160
 viscerally angry about this if C is not

2392
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:47,160
 

2393
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:49,440
 fair and actually it wasn't very fair

2394
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:49,440
 

2395
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:54,050
 what I didn't tell them is who is

2396
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:54,050
 

2397
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:54,050
 responsible for this algorithm it was us

2398
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:55,359
 

2399
00:52:55,369 --> 00:53:01,230
 if they'd clicked down to the credits

2400
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,230
 

2401
00:52:58,890 --> 00:53:02,790
 they could have found that weird written

2402
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:02,790
 

2403
00:53:01,230 --> 00:53:05,810
 the thing and put it on guitars all

2404
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:05,810
 

2405
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:09,810
 open-source explanation etc etc and and

2406
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:09,810
 

2407
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:11,580
 we were responsible for it and it was

2408
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,580
 

2409
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:13,530
 used by nearly three million people in

2410
00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:13,530
 

2411
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:15,690
 the first few days this algorithm is

2412
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,690
 

2413
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:18,090
 staggering we've got all that data now

2414
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,090
 

2415
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:19,920
 unbelief amount of data and and the

2416
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,920
 

2417
00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:21,720
 point is that we've taken an algorithm

2418
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:21,720
 

2419
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:23,790
 has already been developed on 2.3

2420
00:53:21,710 --> 00:53:23,790
 

2421
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:25,740
 million people again a rather simple so

2422
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:25,740
 

2423
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:29,040
 competing risk Cox regression analysis

2424
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:29,040
 

2425
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:30,720
 and then turned it into a heart age

2426
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:30,720
 

2427
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:33,619
 calculator rather than a survival

2428
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:33,619
 

2429
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:36,660
 analysis we are now going to incorporate

2430
00:53:33,609 --> 00:53:36,660
 

2431
00:53:33,619 --> 00:53:39,180
 exercise into the algorithm just to give

2432
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:39,180
 

2433
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:41,940
 it a bit more face validity so I don't

2434
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:41,940
 

2435
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:44,820
 keep on receiving abusive emails from my

2436
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:44,820
 

2437
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:48,290
 colleagues I've had enough of that okay

2438
00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:48,290
 

2439
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:50,220
 so conclusion so I just finished off and

2440
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,220
 

2441
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:51,990
 we need to demonstrate the

2442
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:51,990
 

2443
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:54,450
 trustworthiness of claims by an

2444
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:54,450
 

2445
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:55,980
 algorithm and about an algorithm and we

2446
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:55,980
 

2447
00:53:54,450 --> 00:53:58,920
 need to think about that all the time

2448
00:53:55,970 --> 00:53:58,920
 

2449
00:53:55,980 --> 00:54:00,780
 and there is a phased evaluation of both

2450
00:53:58,910 --> 00:54:00,780
 

2451
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:03,810
 quality and impact that addresses both

2452
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:03,810
 

2453
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:05,910
 of those characteristics the evaluation

2454
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,910
 

2455
00:54:03,810 --> 00:54:07,890
 actually talks about the trustworthiness

2456
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:07,890
 

2457
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:10,170
 of the algorithm and the way in which

2458
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:10,170
 

2459
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:12,090
 the evaluations are communicated then

2460
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,090
 

2461
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:15,030
 asks about the trustworthy of the claims

2462
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:15,030
 

2463
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:17,250
 about the algorithm Ivy I did a little

2464
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:17,250
 

2465
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:18,990
 statistical bit but we can formally rank

2466
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,990
 

2467
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:21,540
 algorithms but a statistical stuff of

2468
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:21,540
 

2469
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:23,190
 that explanation there's no correct way

2470
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:23,190
 

2471
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:25,560
 to do explanation it depends on the

2472
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:25,560
 

2473
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:29,130
 audience multiple forms multiple layers

2474
00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:29,130
 

2475
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:30,930
 but it's got to be evaluated and I

2476
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:30,930
 

2477
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:33,390
 believe in confident communication of

2478
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,390
 

2479
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:34,920
 uncertainty and just to conclude there

2480
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:34,920
 

2481
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:37,560
 are many reasons why people might feel

2482
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:37,560
 

2483
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:40,410
 an algorithm was unfair and I suppose my

2484
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:40,410
 

2485
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:44,130
 plea is that very really quite basic

2486
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:44,130
 

2487
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:47,369
 ideas and statistics might help in many

2488
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:47,369
 

2489
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:48,750
 areas and with that I'll give thanks to

2490
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:48,750
 

2491
00:54:47,369 --> 00:54:51,119
 all the people I who have helped me so

2492
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:51,119
 

2493
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:52,070
 kindly on this thank you very much

2494
00:54:51,109 --> 00:54:52,070
 

2495
00:54:51,119 --> 00:55:03,470
 indeed

2496
00:54:52,060 --> 00:55:03,470
 

2497
00:54:52,070 --> 00:55:06,810
[Applause]

2498
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:06,810
 

2499
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:10,020
 thanks for a fascinating talk I want to

2500
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:10,020
 

2501
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:12,840
 follow up on the NHS predict system so

2502
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:12,840
 

2503
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:15,510
 you talked a lot about uncertainty I did

2504
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:15,510
 

2505
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:17,040
 how to explain that to to users in the

2506
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,040
 

2507
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:18,450
 systems but I want to know a little bit

2508
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:18,450
 

2509
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:20,550
 about the statistical development behind

2510
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,550
 

2511
00:55:18,450 --> 00:55:21,420
 it subscribe I want it I want to know a

2512
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:21,420
 

2513
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:24,690
 little bit about the statistical

2514
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:24,690
 

2515
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:26,700
 development behind it yeah specifically

2516
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:26,700
 

2517
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:29,160
 what I'm interested in knowing is since

2518
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:29,160
 

2519
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:30,510
 this is a what-if type calculator yeah

2520
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:30,510
 

2521
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:32,670
 where you could talk about

2522
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:32,670
 

2523
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:34,790
 counterfactuals how did you assess

2524
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:34,790
 

2525
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:37,500
 whether you have support in the data for

2526
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:37,500
 

2527
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:40,050
 assessing any given counterfactual yeah

2528
00:55:37,490 --> 00:55:40,050
 

2529
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:42,810
 the crucial thing is that the assessment

2530
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:42,810
 

2531
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:44,580
 of the risks based on the tumor size and

2532
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,580
 

2533
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:46,590
 things like is purely observational data

2534
00:55:44,570 --> 00:55:46,590
 

2535
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:48,540
 is a regression analysis and we know

2536
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:48,540
 

2537
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:49,830
 those are associations but the counter

2538
00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:49,830
 

2539
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:51,210
 factor about what if you did this

2540
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:51,210
 

2541
00:55:49,830 --> 00:55:53,880
 treatment rather than that treatment

2542
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,880
 

2543
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:55,200
 that is causal that's not based on the

2544
00:55:53,870 --> 00:55:55,200
 

2545
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:56,700
 observed that is actually taken out of

2546
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:56,700
 

2547
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:59,070
 clinical trial randomized clinical

2548
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:59,070
 

2549
00:55:56,700 --> 00:56:01,320
 trials and so those two sources of

2550
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:01,320
 

2551
00:55:59,070 --> 00:56:04,110
 evidence are combined to construct the

2552
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:04,110
 

2553
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:05,490
 risk index so we can feel confident that

2554
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:05,490
 

2555
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:07,410
 when they click on an alternative

2556
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:07,410
 

2557
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:09,630
 treatment they are getting a causal

2558
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,630
 

2559
00:56:07,410 --> 00:56:12,510
 effect on that one the rest are just

2560
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:12,510
 

2561
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:14,190
 associations and basically and some of

2562
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:14,190
 

2563
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:16,830
 those perhaps a causal to do a tumor

2564
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:16,830
 

2565
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:18,600
 size or the number of positive nodes and

2566
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:18,600
 

2567
00:56:16,830 --> 00:56:20,520
 some are just associations whether it's

2568
00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:20,520
 

2569
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:21,990
 screened detected or symptom or detected

2570
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:21,990
 

2571
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:24,630
 symptomatically it's just an association

2572
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:24,630
 

2573
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:28,370
 you know you can't that's not a causal

2574
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:28,370
 

2575
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:31,290
 root at all and now whether we could and

2576
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:31,290
 

2577
00:56:28,370 --> 00:56:32,850
 we have not done enough evaluation on

2578
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,850
 

2579
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:34,200
 the explanation I thought we'd have done

2580
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:34,200
 

2581
00:56:32,850 --> 00:56:35,790
 more because when I wrote the abstract

2582
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:35,790
 

2583
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:38,400
 for this which is a shame but it that

2584
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:38,400
 

2585
00:56:35,790 --> 00:56:40,680
 seems to be okay and I said we've got

2586
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:40,680
 

2587
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,070
 the text on on describing algorithm and

2588
00:56:40,670 --> 00:56:41,070
 

2589
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:43,050
 things like that

2590
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:43,050
 

2591
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:44,790
 yeah actually 100 people looked at that

2592
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,790
 

2593
00:56:43,050 --> 00:56:47,280
 over the last three months I was amazed

2594
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:47,280
 

2595
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:49,110
 you know we've monitor this on analytics

2596
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:49,110
 

2597
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:51,210
 so people have been looking at some of

2598
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:51,210
 

2599
00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:53,130
 the explanation but really we expect

2600
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,130
 

2601
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:55,350
 those levels of explanation prefer

2602
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:55,350
 

2603
00:56:53,130 --> 00:56:58,760
 beefer really dedicated different

2604
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:58,760
 

2605
00:56:55,350 --> 00:57:01,590
 audience or different audience yeah

2606
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:01,590
 

2607
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:04,940
 great talk thank you I would like to

2608
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:04,940
 

2609
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:08,430
 follow up on the test set bootstrapping

2610
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:08,430
 

2611
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:10,290
 estimates for so if the test site goes

2612
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:10,290
 

2613
00:57:08,430 --> 00:57:10,599
 to infinity the size of the test set

2614
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:10,599
 

2615
00:57:10,290 --> 00:57:12,789
 goes

2616
00:57:10,589 --> 00:57:12,789
 

2617
00:57:10,599 --> 00:57:14,890
 you underestimate your your variability

2618
00:57:12,779 --> 00:57:14,890
 

2619
00:57:12,789 --> 00:57:16,359
 but most of the variability then will

2620
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,359
 

2621
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:17,589
 come from training and maybe the

2622
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:17,589
 

2623
00:57:16,359 --> 00:57:20,130
 training set size and the training

2624
00:57:17,579 --> 00:57:20,130
 

2625
00:57:17,589 --> 00:57:22,479
 procedure so how do you deal with that

2626
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:22,479
 

2627
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:24,489
 I'm sorry if most of the variability

2628
00:57:22,469 --> 00:57:24,489
 

2629
00:57:22,479 --> 00:57:26,049
 then comes from the training set or from

2630
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:26,049
 

2631
00:57:24,489 --> 00:57:27,489
 the training procedure like a neural

2632
00:57:26,039 --> 00:57:27,489
 

2633
00:57:26,049 --> 00:57:30,009
 network will not converge to the same

2634
00:57:27,479 --> 00:57:30,009
 

2635
00:57:27,489 --> 00:57:32,440
 minimum so how do you capture that oh oh

2636
00:57:29,999 --> 00:57:32,440
 

2637
00:57:30,009 --> 00:57:34,329
 yes as I said that only works when you

2638
00:57:32,430 --> 00:57:34,329
 

2639
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:35,769
 actually have got it like in a kaggle

2640
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:35,769
 

2641
00:57:34,329 --> 00:57:38,170
 thing where you have a absolutely fixed

2642
00:57:35,759 --> 00:57:38,170
 

2643
00:57:35,769 --> 00:57:39,670
 algorithm and you know that's unchanged

2644
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,670
 

2645
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:42,549
 you're not a value you're evaluating a

2646
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:42,549
 

2647
00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:44,440
 very specific actual algorithm not the

2648
00:57:42,539 --> 00:57:44,440
 

2649
00:57:42,549 --> 00:57:45,819
 general method that's being used no it's

2650
00:57:44,430 --> 00:57:45,819
 

2651
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:47,589
 much more complicated if you want to

2652
00:57:45,809 --> 00:57:47,589
 

2653
00:57:45,819 --> 00:57:49,089
 evaluate if you're doing it internally

2654
00:57:47,579 --> 00:57:49,089
 

2655
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:50,769
 to the side and want some appropriate

2656
00:57:49,079 --> 00:57:50,769
 

2657
00:57:49,089 --> 00:57:52,450
 method to put into a company because

2658
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:52,450
 

2659
00:57:50,769 --> 00:57:53,799
 then really you you I mean that's like

2660
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,799
 

2661
00:57:52,450 --> 00:57:56,529
 naturally thing would just be to

2662
00:57:53,789 --> 00:57:56,529
 

2663
00:57:53,799 --> 00:57:58,329
 bootstrap the entire procedure again and

2664
00:57:56,519 --> 00:57:58,329
 

2665
00:57:56,529 --> 00:58:00,190
 again now you but that could be very

2666
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:00,190
 

2667
00:57:58,329 --> 00:58:02,739
 exhausting so there could be some more

2668
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:02,739
 

2669
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:04,479
 efficient ways of bootstrapping in in

2670
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:04,479
 

2671
00:58:02,739 --> 00:58:05,950
 subsets or whatever rather than trying

2672
00:58:04,469 --> 00:58:05,950
 

2673
00:58:04,479 --> 00:58:07,180
 to do the whole thing but no no then you

2674
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:07,180
 

2675
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:11,470
 would have to bootstrap the entire

2676
00:58:07,170 --> 00:58:11,470
 

2677
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:14,079
 business there okay thank you very much

2678
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:14,079
 

2679
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:16,660
 for your great talk so my question is I

2680
00:58:14,069 --> 00:58:16,660
 

2681
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:18,910
 think how much trustworthy the algorithm

2682
00:58:16,650 --> 00:58:18,910
 

2683
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:21,039
 is it depends on which person is using

2684
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:21,039
 

2685
00:58:18,910 --> 00:58:22,900
 that algorithm so do you think it's

2686
00:58:21,029 --> 00:58:22,900
 

2687
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:24,400
 important to adjust the algorithm to

2688
00:58:22,890 --> 00:58:24,400
 

2689
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:27,219
 each individual or do you think it's

2690
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:27,219
 

2691
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:28,450
 it's necessary to use the same algorithm

2692
00:58:27,209 --> 00:58:28,450
 

2693
00:58:27,219 --> 00:58:30,819
 for everybody to maintain

2694
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,819
 

2695
00:58:28,450 --> 00:58:32,019
 trustworthiness I I think the predict

2696
00:58:30,809 --> 00:58:32,019
 

2697
00:58:30,819 --> 00:58:33,279
 thing show so I think you need the same

2698
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:33,279
 

2699
00:58:32,019 --> 00:58:34,569
 algorithm for everybody cuz I should be

2700
00:58:33,269 --> 00:58:34,569
 

2701
00:58:33,279 --> 00:58:37,660
 using the same level of skill and

2702
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:37,660
 

2703
00:58:34,569 --> 00:58:40,509
 everybody but people want very different

2704
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:40,509
 

2705
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:42,249
 levels of explanation and so I think the

2706
00:58:40,499 --> 00:58:42,249
 

2707
00:58:40,509 --> 00:58:43,989
 crucial thing is to get led

2708
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:43,989
 

2709
00:58:42,249 --> 00:58:45,640
 so for some people just don't want

2710
00:58:43,979 --> 00:58:45,640
 

2711
00:58:43,989 --> 00:58:47,799
 anything at all you know essentially

2712
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:47,799
 

2713
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:49,239
 they just want to be told what to do and

2714
00:58:47,789 --> 00:58:49,239
 

2715
00:58:47,799 --> 00:58:51,160
 others would like to see more

2716
00:58:49,229 --> 00:58:51,160
 

2717
00:58:49,239 --> 00:58:53,349
 explanation and and they should be able

2718
00:58:51,150 --> 00:58:53,349
 

2719
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:54,819
 to get at it so you need pop ups and you

2720
00:58:53,339 --> 00:58:54,819
 

2721
00:58:53,349 --> 00:58:56,469
 need just you know good design at the

2722
00:58:54,809 --> 00:58:56,469
 

2723
00:58:54,819 --> 00:58:58,539
 top level but then you need layers where

2724
00:58:56,459 --> 00:58:58,539
 

2725
00:58:56,469 --> 00:59:01,450
 people can go down and find it so it can

2726
00:58:58,529 --> 00:59:01,450
 

2727
00:58:58,539 --> 00:59:03,219
 adapt to the order to the user and and

2728
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,219
 

2729
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:05,079
 what we do rather than at the beginning

2730
00:59:03,209 --> 00:59:05,079
 

2731
00:59:03,219 --> 00:59:07,150
 of the site asking people whether they

2732
00:59:05,069 --> 00:59:07,150
 

2733
00:59:05,079 --> 00:59:09,369
 were doctors or patients or experts or

2734
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:09,369
 

2735
00:59:07,150 --> 00:59:11,259
 anything no we just got one site and

2736
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:11,259
 

2737
00:59:09,369 --> 00:59:12,789
 people then explore it themselves every

2738
00:59:11,249 --> 00:59:12,789
 

2739
00:59:11,259 --> 00:59:14,469
 one people are used to doing this now so

2740
00:59:12,779 --> 00:59:14,469
 

2741
00:59:12,789 --> 00:59:16,660
 it's basically do you want to know more

2742
00:59:14,459 --> 00:59:16,660
 

2743
00:59:14,469 --> 00:59:17,359
 do you want to know more and and using

2744
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:17,359
 

2745
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:19,819
 that format

2746
00:59:17,349 --> 00:59:19,819
 

2747
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:22,099
 yeah and give you much thank you for the

2748
00:59:19,809 --> 00:59:22,099
 

2749
00:59:19,819 --> 00:59:24,680
 talk so I guess my question is about the

2750
00:59:22,089 --> 00:59:24,680
 

2751
00:59:22,099 --> 00:59:27,200
 relative versus absolute risk oh yeah so

2752
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:27,200
 

2753
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:29,359
 you said it's heart age and brain age

2754
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:29,359
 

2755
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:31,009
 are very popular but does that mean that

2756
00:59:29,349 --> 00:59:31,009
 

2757
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:33,279
 that's the most important thing to

2758
00:59:30,999 --> 00:59:33,279
 

2759
00:59:31,009 --> 00:59:36,229
 assess because what if I have some

2760
00:59:33,269 --> 00:59:36,229
 

2761
00:59:33,279 --> 00:59:38,900
 hundred times more higher chance of some

2762
00:59:36,219 --> 00:59:38,900
 

2763
00:59:36,229 --> 00:59:41,119
 very unlikely condition yeah absolutely

2764
00:59:38,890 --> 00:59:41,119
 

2765
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:42,589
 now I it's bit naughty cuz normally I

2766
00:59:41,109 --> 00:59:42,589
 

2767
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:44,450
 spend my I usually give talks on

2768
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:44,450
 

2769
00:59:42,589 --> 00:59:46,670
 relative and absolute risk against

2770
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:46,670
 

2771
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:48,229
 relative risk and saying that you cannot

2772
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:48,229
 

2773
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:50,749
 make a rational decision without knowing

2774
00:59:48,219 --> 00:59:50,749
 

2775
00:59:48,229 --> 00:59:53,119
 absolute risks and I still absolutely

2776
00:59:50,739 --> 00:59:53,119
 

2777
00:59:50,749 --> 00:59:55,099
 believe that heart age is a relative is

2778
00:59:53,109 --> 00:59:55,099
 

2779
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:57,200
 the transformation of relative risk it's

2780
00:59:55,089 --> 00:59:57,200
 

2781
00:59:55,099 --> 00:59:59,809
 dead because you know you could say you

2782
00:59:57,190 --> 00:59:59,809
 

2783
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:02,390
 know someone who's 13 could use this and

2784
00:59:59,799 --> 01:00:02,390
 

2785
00:59:59,809 --> 01:00:04,160
 be told their heart ages 39 well their

2786
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:04,160
 

2787
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:05,390
 absolute risk is absolutely tiny of

2788
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:05,390
 

2789
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:07,249
 something happening in the next 10 years

2790
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:07,249
 

2791
01:00:05,390 --> 01:00:10,039
 but the relative risk okay so I'm

2792
01:00:07,239 --> 01:00:10,039
 

2793
01:00:07,249 --> 01:00:12,229
 slightly ambivalent about this because

2794
01:00:10,029 --> 01:00:12,229
 

2795
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:14,719
 it Bailey it's got a big emotional draw

2796
01:00:12,219 --> 01:00:14,719
 

2797
01:00:12,229 --> 01:00:17,059
 it's got a big emotional impact this

2798
01:00:14,709 --> 01:00:17,059
 

2799
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:19,789
 home I'm my body's old missile thing and

2800
01:00:17,049 --> 01:00:19,789
 

2801
01:00:17,059 --> 01:00:21,829
 it's deliberately being used to infer

2802
01:00:19,779 --> 01:00:21,829
 

2803
01:00:19,789 --> 01:00:24,349
 behavior change and again I'm not I'm

2804
01:00:21,819 --> 01:00:24,349
 

2805
01:00:21,829 --> 01:00:25,759
 not I'm not sure about this food we're

2806
01:00:24,339 --> 01:00:25,759
 

2807
01:00:24,349 --> 01:00:27,829
 not responsible for the way the

2808
01:00:25,749 --> 01:00:27,829
 

2809
01:00:25,759 --> 01:00:29,390
 algorithms use we just we just built

2810
01:00:27,819 --> 01:00:29,390
 

2811
01:00:27,829 --> 01:00:31,160
 it's like their nav on Brown we just

2812
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:31,160
 

2813
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:35,539
 send them up and somebody else's job

2814
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:35,539
 

2815
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:37,849
 where they come down so they so I am

2816
01:00:35,529 --> 01:00:37,849
 

2817
01:00:35,539 --> 01:00:39,259
 slightly ambivalent about about this

2818
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:39,259
 

2819
01:00:37,849 --> 01:00:40,609
 because it does have such a big

2820
01:00:39,249 --> 01:00:40,609
 

2821
01:00:39,259 --> 01:00:43,190
 emotional impact and people have

2822
01:00:40,599 --> 01:00:43,190
 

2823
01:00:40,609 --> 01:00:45,619
 criticized it because it could make 30

2824
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:45,619
 

2825
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:47,660
 year olds anxious when in fact their

2826
01:00:45,609 --> 01:00:47,660
 

2827
01:00:45,619 --> 01:00:49,729
 risk is incredibly low the doctors on

2828
01:00:47,650 --> 01:00:49,729
 

2829
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:51,640
 the other hand say yes but we want those

2830
01:00:49,719 --> 01:00:51,640
 

2831
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:54,410
 30 years to change their behaviors now

2832
01:00:51,630 --> 01:00:54,410
 

2833
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:56,959
 rather than waiting until their absolute

2834
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,959
 

2835
01:00:54,410 --> 01:01:01,130
 risk get in this when the 50s and 60s

2836
01:00:56,949 --> 01:01:01,130
 

2837
01:00:56,959 --> 01:01:03,049
 gets high so that's their ideas that it

2838
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:03,049
 

2839
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:04,940
 is appropriate is relative risk when

2840
01:01:03,039 --> 01:01:04,940
 

2841
01:01:03,049 --> 01:01:07,789
 you're trying to do long-term lifestyle

2842
01:01:04,930 --> 01:01:07,789
 

2843
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:11,449
 changes so it's a delicate business then

2844
01:01:07,779 --> 01:01:11,449
 

2845
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:13,549
 again yeah so there's a lot of concern

2846
01:01:11,439 --> 01:01:13,549
 

2847
01:01:11,449 --> 01:01:15,529
 about whether neural nets are safe and

2848
01:01:13,539 --> 01:01:15,529
 

2849
01:01:13,549 --> 01:01:17,769
 effective and there is a recent

2850
01:01:15,519 --> 01:01:17,769
 

2851
01:01:15,529 --> 01:01:20,749
 bestseller weapons of mass destruction

2852
01:01:17,759 --> 01:01:20,749
 

2853
01:01:17,769 --> 01:01:22,880
 right where they ask lots of questions

2854
01:01:20,739 --> 01:01:22,880
 

2855
01:01:20,749 --> 01:01:25,039
 but don't offer many constructive

2856
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:25,039
 

2857
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:27,499
 suggestions there's a lot of work on

2858
01:01:25,029 --> 01:01:27,499
 

2859
01:01:25,039 --> 01:01:28,789
 explainable AI but I'm not very hopeful

2860
01:01:27,489 --> 01:01:28,789
 

2861
01:01:27,499 --> 01:01:30,080
 that it's really going to answer the

2862
01:01:28,779 --> 01:01:30,080
 

2863
01:01:28,789 --> 01:01:32,000
 question

2864
01:01:30,070 --> 01:01:32,000
 

2865
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:34,610
 and I kind of like the idea of reducing

2866
01:01:31,990 --> 01:01:34,610
 

2867
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:37,190
 this to the drug test approach that you

2868
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:37,190
 

2869
01:01:34,610 --> 01:01:39,260
 sort of described but my question is are

2870
01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:39,260
 

2871
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:41,090
 the methods of deciding whether drugs

2872
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:41,090
 

2873
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:42,920
 are safe and effective they don't get

2874
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,920
 

2875
01:01:41,090 --> 01:01:45,290
 into mechanisms that's what explainable

2876
01:01:42,910 --> 01:01:45,290
 

2877
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:47,660
 AI tries to do but are those mechanisms

2878
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:47,660
 

2879
01:01:45,290 --> 01:01:49,820
 are the methods that we use for deciding

2880
01:01:47,650 --> 01:01:49,820
 

2881
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:52,340
 the drug is safe and effective are those

2882
01:01:49,810 --> 01:01:52,340
 

2883
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:53,900
 methods safe and effective well people

2884
01:01:52,330 --> 01:01:53,900
 

2885
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:55,370
 would argue about that quite a lot they

2886
01:01:53,890 --> 01:01:55,370
 

2887
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:57,590
 were brought in occurs after thalidomide

2888
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:57,590
 

2889
01:01:55,370 --> 01:01:59,810
 was the big you know thing that provoked

2890
01:01:57,580 --> 01:01:59,810
 

2891
01:01:57,590 --> 01:02:01,400
 the introduction of the of the controls

2892
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,400
 

2893
01:01:59,810 --> 01:02:03,350
 this is you know it depends what you

2894
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:03,350
 

2895
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:06,710
 think about the way the FDA works they

2896
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:06,710
 

2897
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:08,330
 because have had to withdraw drugs after

2898
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:08,330
 

2899
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:10,130
 they've been on the market because of

2900
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:10,130
 

2901
01:02:08,330 --> 01:02:11,540
 side effects being found long-term now

2902
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:11,540
 

2903
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:12,920
 whether that's effective whether that's

2904
01:02:11,530 --> 01:02:12,920
 

2905
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:14,630
 appropriate is another matter because

2906
01:02:12,910 --> 01:02:14,630
 

2907
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:16,010
 often they are effective drugs I mean

2908
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:16,010
 

2909
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:19,250
 the point is that drugs can be both

2910
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,250
 

2911
01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:22,070
 effective and unsafe yes but would you

2912
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:22,070
 

2913
01:02:19,250 --> 01:02:25,520
 recommend that for neural nets sorry

2914
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:25,520
 

2915
01:02:22,070 --> 01:02:27,890
 would you recommend the drug methods of

2916
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:27,890
 

2917
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:30,470
 FDA testing for neural nets

2918
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:30,470
 

2919
01:02:27,890 --> 01:02:32,630
 I think elements of it and as I said

2920
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:32,630
 

2921
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:35,240
 it's a very pragmatic idea does it work

2922
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:35,240
 

2923
01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:36,620
 you don't actually have to say exactly

2924
01:02:35,230 --> 01:02:36,620
 

2925
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:38,270
 why you're worried I think it becomes

2926
01:02:36,610 --> 01:02:38,270
 

2927
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:42,590
 more convincing the argument if you can

2928
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:42,590
 

2929
01:02:38,270 --> 01:02:44,810
 say why it works and explanations only

2930
01:02:42,580 --> 01:02:44,810
 

2931
01:02:42,590 --> 01:02:46,160
 based on Association you must think is

2932
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,160
 

2933
01:02:44,810 --> 01:02:49,670
 going to be more fragile because

2934
01:02:46,150 --> 01:02:49,670
 

2935
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:51,230
 situations might change and actually it

2936
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:51,230
 

2937
01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:52,940
 means that you don't feel so confident

2938
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:52,940
 

2939
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:55,070
 about it so I would believe in it a

2940
01:02:52,930 --> 01:02:55,070
 

2941
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:57,980
 causal explanation was much more

2942
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:57,980
 

2943
01:02:55,070 --> 01:03:00,860
 trustworthy the one based purely on past

2944
01:02:57,970 --> 01:03:00,860
 

2945
01:02:57,980 --> 01:03:02,150
 performance and one based on the sorting

2946
01:03:00,850 --> 01:03:02,150
 

2947
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:03,740
 the sort of thing that in that book the

2948
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:03,740
 

2949
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:05,900
 mass destruction weapons of mass

2950
01:03:03,730 --> 01:03:05,900
 

2951
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:07,640
 destruction book based on like compass

2952
01:03:05,890 --> 01:03:07,640
 

2953
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:09,410
 is a proprietary algorithm for

2954
01:03:07,630 --> 01:03:09,410
 

2955
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:11,210
 recidivism I thought is the most

2956
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:11,210
 

2957
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:13,880
 untrustworthy thing you could ever think

2958
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,880
 

2959
01:03:11,210 --> 01:03:15,830
 of because it's both opaque you can't

2960
01:03:13,870 --> 01:03:15,830
 

2961
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:17,600
 get at it it doesn't abate any of those

2962
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:17,600
 

2963
01:03:15,830 --> 01:03:20,360
 criteria that I've been listening today

2964
01:03:17,590 --> 01:03:20,360
 

2965
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:22,970
 so actually I do feel that the actual

2966
01:03:20,350 --> 01:03:22,970
 

2967
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:25,250
 form of the algorithm the mathematics

2968
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,250
 

2969
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:27,320
 behind it I'm increasingly feeling is

2970
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:27,320
 

2971
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:29,270
 not the issue of great importance for

2972
01:03:27,310 --> 01:03:29,270
 

2973
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:30,890
 things like predict if somebody had a

2974
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:30,890
 

2975
01:03:29,270 --> 01:03:32,630
 good neural network then I wouldn't care

2976
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:32,630
 

2977
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:35,780
 less actually that would just be fine I

2978
01:03:32,620 --> 01:03:35,780
 

2979
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:37,550
 wouldn't mind too much because and what

2980
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:37,550
 

2981
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:38,930
 I want to do is use it test it so

2982
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:38,930
 

2983
01:03:37,550 --> 01:03:41,740
 extensively but they still felt

2984
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:41,740
 

2985
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:41,740
 confident about

2986
01:03:43,910 --> 01:03:43,910
 

2987
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:49,540
 one last question yeah I was wondering

2988
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:49,540
 

2989
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:52,120
 so explain ability of AI is one thing

2990
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:52,120
 

2991
01:03:49,540 --> 01:03:52,960
 but like there's the idea of too much

2992
01:03:52,110 --> 01:03:52,960
 

2993
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:55,420
 information

2994
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:55,420
 

2995
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:57,580
 so do thoughts about yeah that yeah oh

2996
01:03:55,410 --> 01:03:57,580
 

2997
01:03:55,420 --> 01:03:59,320
 absolutely no you mustn't bombard a lot

2998
01:03:57,570 --> 01:03:59,320
 

2999
01:03:57,580 --> 01:04:00,250
 of people just don't want to know they

3000
01:03:59,310 --> 01:04:00,250
 

3001
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:02,170
 don't want to know they don't want to

3002
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:02,170
 

3003
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:04,150
 know and so no no you've got to really

3004
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:04,150
 

3005
01:04:02,170 --> 01:04:06,280
 you know you've got to want to see if I

3006
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:06,280
 

3007
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:08,290
 think and and that's why again the lead

3008
01:04:06,270 --> 01:04:08,290
 

3009
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:10,120
 communication that but it's got to be

3010
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:10,120
 

3011
01:04:08,290 --> 01:04:11,530
 there if people do want to get at it you

3012
01:04:10,110 --> 01:04:11,530
 

3013
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:13,030
 can put a lot of work into something and

3014
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,030
 

3015
01:04:11,530 --> 01:04:15,070
 nobody looks at it but you've still done

3016
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:15,070
 

3017
01:04:13,030 --> 01:04:16,900
 it and that's part of being trustworthy

3018
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:16,900
 

3019
01:04:15,070 --> 01:04:18,700
 is to make sure that if people do want

3020
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:18,700
 

3021
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:20,560
 to see it they look and of course though

3022
01:04:18,690 --> 01:04:20,560
 

3023
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:22,330
 once they start trusting the algorithm

3024
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:22,330
 

3025
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:23,770
 and then they don't bother with that

3026
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:23,770
 

3027
01:04:22,330 --> 01:04:25,150
 they just go straight to the answer and

3028
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,150
 

3029
01:04:23,770 --> 01:04:26,890
 then you've got the dangers of over

3030
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:26,890
 

3031
01:04:25,150 --> 01:04:28,990
 trust I think that can definitely happen

3032
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,990
 

3033
01:04:26,890 --> 01:04:31,210
 and that's a massive thing to monitor to

3034
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:31,210
 

3035
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:32,920
 make sure that people don't become so

3036
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,920
 

3037
01:04:31,210 --> 01:04:38,950
 reliant on it they don't think about it

3038
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:38,950
 

3039
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:48,930
 at all yeah thank you for the great talk

3040
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:48,930
