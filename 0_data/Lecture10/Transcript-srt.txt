GARY GENSLER:
Welcome to FinTech--

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,400
Shaping the World of Finance.

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,160
We're going to talk about
challenger banks today.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,360
And we've chatted in our last
session about credit, payment

8
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,470
before that.

9
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,590
But challenger banks
is an interesting topic

10
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,790
that I thought we
should take a moment

11
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,670
and just talk about
challenger banks.

12
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:37,290
This is this concept built
upon building a bank that's

13
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:44,070
internet-only, building a bank
that has no bricks and mortar

14
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,630
office.

15
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,763
Now, it's not actually
a new concept.

16
00:00:47,763 --> 00:00:50,430
And in this lecture, we're going
to talk a little bit about what

17
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,600
was happening even then
in the 1990s and the 2000s

18
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,050
when online banking started.

19
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,260
But this term, challenger
bank, and another related term,

20
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:07,140
neobanks, relates to
something a little bit later.

21
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:14,220
Ally Bank, which used to
be the old auto lending

22
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,350
part of General
Motors, the largest--

23
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,350
at one point, at one point
the largest auto manufacturer

24
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,110
in the US--

25
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:25,400
Ally Bank in 2009 decided
it was not just going

26
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,275
to be an auto lender.

27
00:01:26,275 --> 00:01:27,567
They're going to become a bank.

28
00:01:27,567 --> 00:01:29,210
And in 2009, they
said they were going

29
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,640
to be an internet-only bank.

30
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,030
Over in Europe, and
particularly the United Kingdom,

31
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,890
many people say challenger
banks started in Europe,

32
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,070
in the United
Kingdom, particularly

33
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,710
when the official
sector got involved

34
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,960
and through something
called the Payment Systems

35
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,540
Directive and the Payment
System Directive 2

36
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,750
and then later in the United
Kingdom around open banking--

37
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:54,600
we've talked about
this, about open APIs--

38
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,600
that it opened up the
system a little bit.

39
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:04,290
And by 2013 to 2015, you saw a
slew of these challenger banks

40
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,610
and neobanks getting
into this space,

41
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,720
first particularly in
Europe, then a lot in the US,

42
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,920
now around the globe.

43
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,030
You can find challenger
banks and neobanks in Brazil,

44
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,690
in India, and Southeast
Asia, in China.

45
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:25,020
Some of them have been
started by big tech companies.

46
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,000
And in the last
few years, you have

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,110
big finance reacting as well,
like Goldman Sachs starting

48
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,040
Marcus.

49
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,240
And so now the term
gets a little loose.

50
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,280
Is a challenger bank and
neobank if Goldman Sachs

51
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,210
is starting Marcus?

52
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:42,010
That doesn't feel like
a challenger bank.

53
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:47,020
Goldman Sachs is established
140, 150-year-old investment

54
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,290
bank.

55
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,230
So it gets a little blurry.

56
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,720
And I admit that in this
space, there's sometimes

57
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,850
terms don't fit well together.

58
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,550
I'm going to upload
the slides here

59
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,930
for a second and share slides.

60
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,268
But Romain is there any
questions as we're starting?

61
00:03:02,268 --> 00:03:03,310
TA: Nothing so far, Gary.

62
00:03:13,415 --> 00:03:15,578
GARY GENSLER: So we're
going to go back to a topic

63
00:03:15,578 --> 00:03:17,120
that we didn't have
quite enough time

64
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,990
to finish in class seven, credit
scoring and alternative data.

65
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,270
And it's an important
topic that underlies

66
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,820
some of what's going on
with challenger backs, not

67
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,420
everything.

68
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,290
And then we're going to talk
about some traditional banking,

69
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,740
online banking as it sort
of began in the late '90S

70
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,760
and in the noughts.

71
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:39,380
And what is this new wave,
neo or challenging banks,

72
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:44,420
some of how they're funded and
their own valuations, and then

73
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:48,410
the big finance reaction.

74
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,740
So back to data--

75
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,410
there is a company.

76
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,150
Many of us know it as FICO.

77
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:59,370
It's actually called the Fair
Isaac Company, started 60

78
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:04,050
some years ago, started
by two Stanford graduates,

79
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:08,460
not MIT, but a very
good institution.

80
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:11,070
And they were more
into data analytics.

81
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:14,430
And remember, credit cards
had started in the 1950s.

82
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,550
And here it was, the
late '50s, early 60s,

83
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:24,882
a fintech company of its time
trying to do analysis on data.

84
00:04:24,882 --> 00:04:28,370
A gentleman named Fair and
a gentleman named Isaac--

85
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,840
I don't recall
their first names,

86
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,460
I think one was Bill Isaac--

87
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,570
start this company.

88
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,850
It's a data analytics company.

89
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:39,290
And by the late 1970s,
it had taken hold.

90
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:42,530
By the 1980s, it was
the dominant player

91
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:47,400
for consumer credit ratings.

92
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,120
And their system is now
used in 32 countries.

93
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,660
And many other companies are
using the FICO score system.

94
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,513
But it's only one system.

95
00:04:58,513 --> 00:05:00,430
And this gives you a
little bit of background.

96
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:04,300
It's about what your amounts
that you owe, the payment

97
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:10,720
history on those credit cards
and other bank relations.

98
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,460
Are you taking out new credit?

99
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:16,000
We could do a whole class
just on FICO scores.

100
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,840
They have updated it
at least eight times.

101
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,800
And in the summer
of 2020, I think

102
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,990
they're rolling out FICO 9.0.

103
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,880
It's possibly FICO 10.0.

104
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,590
So it's not static, but
it's built in another era.

105
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:33,790
It's built in an era
about your payment history

106
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:36,850
around your bank credit.

107
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,470
It doesn't include
many of the things

108
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:41,280
that we would normally
think to include.

109
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,050
And so what is it that
we're going through now?

110
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,550
We're going through
a period of time

111
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,383
where folks are saying,
well, wait a minute,

112
00:05:47,383 --> 00:05:50,740
maybe there are other
ways, alternative ways

113
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:54,730
to figure out and
assess your credit.

114
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,440
And it's called
alternative data.

115
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,130
Alternative Data in a sense is
just alternative to whatever

116
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,320
FICO might be using.

117
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,080
This could be your bank,
checking, employment, income,

118
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,150
insurance, tenant, utilities.

119
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,610
All of this currently
is not in FICO scoring.

120
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:13,450
Now, in some countries,
employment data and income data

121
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:18,130
is already and has been for
decades used for consumer

122
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,870
credit underwriting.

123
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:22,750
But in the US and up
to 30 other countries

124
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,870
using the FICO
scores, a lot of this,

125
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:28,720
even this classic
information like did you

126
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,040
pay your rent on time, did you
pay your utilities on time,

127
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,160
is not necessarily
included in FICO.

128
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,300
It's partly because they didn't
have the data in the 1970s

129
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,210
when Fair and Isaac
were doing this.

130
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,280
And eight versions
later, they still

131
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,340
haven't included a lot
of utility and tenancy.

132
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:53,170
OK, secondly, there's something
called cash flow underwriting.

133
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:56,920
And if we go to China and
we go to payment wallets

134
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:01,470
around the globe, but let's stay
with China, Alipay and WeChat

135
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:05,390
Pay now can really see
a lot of your cash flow,

136
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:08,530
not just your expenditures,
but your revenues, if you're

137
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:15,100
moving your income in on some
regular basis into a wallet.

138
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,280
And cash flow underwriting is
even more relevant-- again,

139
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,580
let's stay with
Alipay for a moment--

140
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:25,150
about small and
medium-sized enterprises.

141
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:28,510
So whether it's Alipay
in China or Toast,

142
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:31,390
a payment start up in the
restaurant business here

143
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:35,860
in the US, Toast can start
to see all the revenues

144
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:39,790
and expenditures of a restaurant
and sort of make a credit

145
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,940
decision based upon that.

146
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,440
So cash flow underwriting
is a very important thing.

147
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,380
You don't necessarily
need machine learning

148
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:51,700
or AI to incorporate
this alternative data.

149
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:56,270
But the alternative data is
something that FICO doesn't do.

150
00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:01,090
And classic banking, doing
small and medium-sized lending,

151
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:07,070
doesn't necessarily do good
cash flow underwriting.

152
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:10,235
Romain any questions?

153
00:08:10,235 --> 00:08:11,540
TA: None so far on this topic.

154
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,457
We got one question from
Luke that perhaps you

155
00:08:13,457 --> 00:08:16,070
can touch upon later on
why online banking started

156
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:19,440
in Europe versus other regions.

157
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,440
GARY GENSLER: OK, OK.

158
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:26,070
Let me hold the Luke question
when we get into that as well.

159
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,880
Your consumption,
your purchase data--

160
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,250
Visa and Mastercard
already are looking at this

161
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,260
to cross-sell to us.

162
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,169
And others are looking
at it to cross-sell.

163
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:39,460
If you're buying sports
equipment or hiking equipment,

164
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,100
we, all of a sudden,
get advertising for it.

165
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,910
But can alternative
data, like what you buy,

166
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,110
relate to your credit?

167
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,000
Well, let's talk about
something that's been

168
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,990
known for some time.

169
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,960
I don't know how
many of you would

170
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:57,820
have ever, when you went to
replace an automobile tire,

171
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,740
decide to get it retreaded.

172
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:05,130
Literally, a retread is
putting rubber, new rubber

173
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,980
on the old tire.

174
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,830
Now, retreads or
something that we

175
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:13,050
don't usually talk about
in a finance course.

176
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,420
But it has been
shown that those who

177
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:20,370
buy retreads are a little bit
more susceptible to credit

178
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:25,320
risk, meaning default, meaning
they're a higher risk credit.

179
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,260
What if you could track
people's purchases,

180
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:33,480
whether it's automobile
retreads versus new tires--

181
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,000
you see the difference--
or anything else

182
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,580
that in the purchase
history gives you a sense,

183
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,490
is this a higher risk credit
or a lower risk credit?

184
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:44,550
You can take purchase
and consumption data

185
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:48,870
and tie it to are they
higher insurance risk?

186
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:52,046
Are they a higher
risk in their credit?

187
00:09:52,046 --> 00:09:53,830
Now, you have to be careful.

188
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:59,370
You have to be careful to comply
with local law and societal

189
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:04,500
norms about not using
alternative data that might be

190
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,360
suggestive of something else.

191
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,320
It might be suggestive
of cultural differences,

192
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,630
of race or gender
or ethnic background

193
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,590
or sexual orientation.

194
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,740
And if your consumption
of purchase data

195
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,520
has to do with that and you end
up with something in the US,

196
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,440
you could easily be
on the wrong side

197
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,720
of what's called the
Equal Credit Opportunity

198
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,950
Act, that you have to
basically be fair and unbiased

199
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,720
in your extension of credit.

200
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,980
And this is sort of
at the cutting ground

201
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:37,280
of alternative data, is
how does alternative data

202
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:43,850
get used, but not inadvertently,
or worse, purposely,

203
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:46,200
trip up fairness
and bias issues.

204
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,030
And we saw that recently
with Apple Credit Card.

205
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:55,490
Apple Credit Card rolled
out in the spring of 2019--

206
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:59,030
a partnership between
Apple, Goldman Sachs' Marcus

207
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:02,780
and Mastercard, a
new, innovative thing

208
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,880
that big tech was
rolling out with big

209
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,160
find in the spring of 2019.

210
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,550
And all of a sudden,
a venture capitalist

211
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:13,490
runs into the Apple
Credit Card and finds

212
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:17,240
that he and his spouse
were going to get

213
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,690
10 times different credit.

214
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:21,550
They file tax returns together.

215
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:25,700
They were together, apparently
worth many millions of dollars,

216
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,370
maybe centimillionaire.

217
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:31,180
And he starts to
advertise on Twitter

218
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:34,120
and promote that the Apple
Credit Card had a problem.

219
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,820
And then Steve Wozniak,
the co-founder of Apple,

220
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:40,120
publicly announces that he
ran into the same problem

221
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,070
with his wife and himself.

222
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:44,110
Again, they filed
their taxes together.

223
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,750
They're both
extraordinarily wealthy.

224
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,180
Why would one have 10
times or 20 times more

225
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,800
the credit than the other?

226
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,300
There seemed to be,
for whatever reason,

227
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,970
some gender bias in the Apple
Credit allocation alternative

228
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,650
data system.

229
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:02,870
Now, we don't know yet
to this day what it was.

230
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:06,130
But what we do know is that
Apple Credit Cards stubbed

231
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:08,710
their toe on their rollout.

232
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,390
Sometimes it's about the law.

233
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:13,180
Sometimes, though,
it's about business.

234
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:16,270
Sometimes it's about
breaking societal norms.

235
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,600
But in that case, Apple
had a tough rollout.

236
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,340
They roll out Apple Credit Card.

237
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,230
And yet they have
the co-founder,

238
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,380
former founder of Apple
saying not so fast,

239
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,240
you've got a problem here.

240
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,070
The other sets of data
is our social footprint,

241
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:35,710
our social and media
footprint-- app usage,

242
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,950
browsing history, the like,
geolocation, et cetera.

243
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:42,070
And in this world of
coronavirus and the crisis,

244
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:44,770
we know that geolocation
is going to be used

245
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:48,790
and is already likely being
used for a lot of contact

246
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,880
tracing in many
countries, certainly

247
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,040
in Korea from the news reports.

248
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,070
And I'm guessing Luke could
tell us more about that.

249
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:02,990
But we know that
contact tracing and all

250
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:07,630
of the attributes of figuring
out who we are as an individual

251
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,610
are being traced more and more.

252
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:13,510
In China, there's a social
credit scoring system

253
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:18,490
that is an official
part of the government's

254
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,650
approach to extending credit.

255
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:23,030
It might be whether you
can buy an airline ticket.

256
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:26,080
It may be whether you can
even get on the commuter rail

257
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,320
system, depending
upon your app usage.

258
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,920
And that app usage in
China even includes, as I

259
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,260
understand it, not just your--

260
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,180
what you're doing
on Alipay or WeChat

261
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:40,780
Pay, but also what you're
doing on dating websites.

262
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,510
Literally, I repeat
on dating websites,

263
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:48,520
and whether and how you're
on any website or any app

264
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:53,420
could be a little bit
like the tire retreading,

265
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,510
that you might be--

266
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,810
you might find, through
the alternative data,

267
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:59,100
that it's a little different.

268
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,300
Here in the US, many
fintech companies

269
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,190
are approaching the
regulators and saying

270
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:08,100
we don't want to trip up and be
on the wrong side of the Equal

271
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,540
Credit Opportunity Act.

272
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,820
We don't want to be on the
wrong side of other laws,

273
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,730
like Fair Credit Reporting,
Truth in Lending Act,

274
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,160
and a series of other laws.

275
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,590
Please help us,
regulators, interpret

276
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:23,220
how we can use alternative
data, how we can actually

277
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:28,870
be more inclusive, provide
more and better finance

278
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:32,440
to more people at a
lower cost, but not

279
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,250
be on the wrong side of
these important societal

280
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,060
and legal norms.

281
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,780
So it's a very
interesting place.

282
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:46,240
I'll use one example from a
conversation with Lending Club.

283
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,440
I had the honor
to be on a stage--

284
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,960
before the crisis, one
of the last conferences

285
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,000
was an MIT fintech conference.

286
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,510
And I was on the stage with
the CEO of Lending Club

287
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:02,710
and having a good
interview, a fireside chat.

288
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:06,340
And I asked about alternative
data and how they use it.

289
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,760
They use it.

290
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,650
But what they find is in
using alternative data

291
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:13,570
in that marketplace
lending company,

292
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:18,100
they then use machine learning
on the alternative data.

293
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:22,030
They find some what they
believe to be correlations.

294
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:26,530
And then they just use straight
up regression analysis.

295
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:30,850
Once they identify
an attribute, they

296
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,920
put the machine
learning to the side.

297
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,970
They've used it.

298
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:38,320
But then they sort of then go
to the down-scaled old way,

299
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,760
just straight up.

300
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,560
That's an attribute
we've identified.

301
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,780
Tire retreads matter.

302
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:49,060
Let's just use it that way.

303
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:52,360
So they do it by trying
to find some attributes

304
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,420
and then move on, as I
understood the conversation.

305
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,830
So there's a tremendous
ecosystem in alternative data,

306
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:00,370
too.

307
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,110
This is just a
slide that pulled.

308
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:04,680
You can readily get these types
of slides on the internet.

309
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:09,440
But this is from CB Insights
as to alternative data sources.

310
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,720
This is a bunch of companies--

311
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,390
I wouldn't necessarily
call them fintech startups,

312
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,640
but they're companies
trying to service,

313
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,550
here's how we can help
you either with machine

314
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:21,160
learning, AI, or
actually sources

315
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,160
of data in this whole space.

316
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,270
So I'm going to move on to the
challenger bank discussion,

317
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:30,512
but pause for a moment to
see if there are questions.

318
00:16:30,512 --> 00:16:32,470
I know Luke had a question,
but that was really

319
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,620
about challenger banks.

320
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,025
So [Romain?

321
00:16:35,025 --> 00:16:38,350
TA: Hassan.

322
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:40,480
AUDIENCE: Hi, yeah.

323
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,250
I mean, if you
could just elaborate

324
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,825
on cash flow underwriting.

325
00:16:44,825 --> 00:16:47,040
I do not quite get it.

326
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,270
GARY GENSLER: So let's do
it in a small business.

327
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:55,330
And let's use either the
example of toast in the US

328
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:57,670
with restaurants or
almost any business

329
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:00,580
that Alipay has the wallet.

330
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:04,599
What Alipay or Toast and
see on that small business

331
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:07,420
or restaurant is they
can see their revenues

332
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,304
and they can see their
expenditures to the extent

333
00:17:10,304 --> 00:17:14,260
that it's kept inside
that payment architecture.

334
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:18,760
So in Alipay, they've
incentivized the millions

335
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:23,290
of merchants using Alipay
not only to receive revenues

336
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:27,280
into their Alipay Wallet, but
also to pay their suppliers

337
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,470
with the Alipay Wallet.

338
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:32,620
So what Alipay
can do and does do

339
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:37,335
is they can start to see the
entire picture or 80% or 90%

340
00:17:37,335 --> 00:17:37,960
of the picture.

341
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,960
They might not see
the entire picture,

342
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:47,560
but they can literally build a
whole 360 degrees around them.

343
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,500
Or take something like
Intuit here in the US,

344
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,390
which is the company
that was founded

345
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:57,070
20 plus years ago that has
the most dominant sort of tax

346
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,800
software, TurboTax.

347
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,290
Intuit is also in
the fintech space.

348
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,500
They recently announced
buying Credit Karma

349
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,330
for billions of dollars.

350
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:10,900
And they also have
other fintech offerings,

351
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:14,920
where they can maybe
build a greater picture.

352
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,050
I call it cash
flow underwriting.

353
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:19,660
It means underwriting,
assessing the risk,

354
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:23,830
because you can see the revenues
and expenditures and build,

355
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:28,750
in essence, an income
statement on the merchant.

356
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:33,670
Amazon can do some of that, not
completely as well as Alipay.

357
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:36,790
But Amazon can do some of
that through Amazon Prime

358
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:39,700
and what they can
see on the merchant.

359
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,190
Did that help?

360
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:44,270
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

361
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,620
GARY GENSLER: And it gives
them a competitive advantage.

362
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:50,220
And it's part of why getting
into the payment space

363
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,800
before getting into
the credit space

364
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,250
is a business model,
particularly in big tech.

365
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,290
Now, I'm not saying
that's what was

366
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:01,770
the initial reason that Alipay
got into the payment space.

367
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:05,100
Alipay was trying to promote
their online platform.

368
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,470
Amazon got into
the payment space

369
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:09,580
to promote their
online platform.

370
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,720
And even Toast, the
restaurant software business,

371
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,760
got into the restaurant
business to sell tablets.

372
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,210
They were thinking we'll
sell the better hardware

373
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:25,590
to the restaurateurs,
because this tablet was

374
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,870
important for the
servers, what we

375
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,520
might call waiters
and waitresses,

376
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,530
walking around a restaurant.

377
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:35,130
But what they quickly
found is that the Toast--

378
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:36,420
this is the example--

379
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,180
they pivoted from being a
hardware tablet business

380
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,560
to being a payment business.

381
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,800
And then they start to be
a credit business as well,

382
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,910
because the data they're
receiving in a partial cash

383
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:51,630
flow underwriting-- they
don't have a full 360--

384
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:54,450
allows them to start to
underwrite in that business.

385
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:57,570
And frankly, they're likely
to be able to do it better

386
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:59,310
than a traditional bank.

387
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,410
A traditional bank
that might get

388
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:04,770
annual or quarterly
financials will not

389
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:08,880
have quite the up-to-date
sensitivity as to how

390
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,880
that restaurant's doing.

391
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:17,450
TA: And we have a question from
Danielle about data aggregators

392
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:17,992
on the slide.

393
00:20:17,992 --> 00:20:19,200
GARY GENSLER: Please, please.

394
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,080
TA: Are the different
data aggregator players

395
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,860
for the purposes of selling
to fintech customers

396
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,120
or for selling to
companies who want

397
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,250
to use the data for
personalized advertising?

398
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,530
And if yes, why?

399
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,983
Do you anticipate
any consolidation?

400
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:34,400
GARY GENSLER: No,
I think Danielle

401
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,810
raised a good question.

402
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:37,220
They're data aggregators.

403
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:40,970
And the terms, again, are
not terribly well-defined.

404
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:44,450
They're data aggregators
that could be there,

405
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:48,560
as Danielle points out,
to cross-market, to sell.

406
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,040
And even-- let's use
Credit Karma for a minute.

407
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:57,020
Credit Karma initially was
about providing free access

408
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,970
to your credit report.

409
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:01,790
That was their initial insight.

410
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:06,290
What they found over time
is they could cross-sell

411
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:09,660
and become a friendly
website for free

412
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,480
to give you access to credit.

413
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,040
They were cross-selling.

414
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,720
But then they were
also collecting a fee.

415
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,340
And they were
collecting more data.

416
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:23,140
And inevitably, they had
100 plus million files,

417
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:26,590
even though they had
much fewer customers.

418
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:30,100
But data aggregation could
also come from another space.

419
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:34,240
Plaid, Galileo, and
others, we call them also

420
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,350
data aggregators.

421
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:38,920
And they started as
software providers

422
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,190
to provide an open
API, as we discussed.

423
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:45,430
But then they create
a data warehouse.

424
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,080
And they become
data aggregators.

425
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:51,170
So the term data aggregator
can be used in many ways.

426
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:54,490
One small way it can be used
is the second way Danielle

427
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:57,080
mentioned, and it's kind
of mentioned on this slide

428
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,480
of alternative data.

429
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,440
There's some companies that
just said we will collect data.

430
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,050
FICO score doesn't
have utility data.

431
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:09,530
We'll collect the utility
data and rental payment data.

432
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:14,120
We believe it will become an
alternative data aggregator.

433
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,040
So yes, they're are
data aggregator.

434
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:20,000
But they're collecting
data with the clear mind

435
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,630
that they're going to
enhance credit scoring.

436
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:25,670
And as we turn now
to challenger banks,

437
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:27,420
challenger banks
might say, look,

438
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:31,010
we don't have the
ability in our first year

439
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:33,530
or even maybe 10
years of business

440
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:36,680
to be the one collecting all
that utility and rent payment

441
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,750
or social media data.

442
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,760
We want to turn
to somebody else.

443
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,770
You might create
a business simply

444
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:45,680
to say we are going to
be a data aggregator

445
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:50,120
to enhance the underwriting
of these banks.

446
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,190
There's hundreds of
challenger banks.

447
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:55,340
I want to be a service provider
to those challenger banks.

448
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,690
So Danielle, good question.

449
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:58,195
It could be on marketing.

450
00:22:58,195 --> 00:22:59,570
It could be that
you've got there

451
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:03,020
because you were in the business
of something else, payments

452
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,780
or credit scoring,
like Credit Karma.

453
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,000
Or you could
specifically say I just

454
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,630
want to have a
business model simply

455
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:15,690
about an alternative
data field that I think

456
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:17,600
and my machine
learning might tell me

457
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,490
that alternative
data field is going

458
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:21,050
to give us better underwriting.

459
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:23,570
And then I will sell to
all the other fintechs.

460
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,760
I will service fintechs
by collecting data.

461
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,105
Romain anything else, or--

462
00:23:31,105 --> 00:23:33,366
TA: We have Nikhil and
Brian with their hands up.

463
00:23:33,366 --> 00:23:34,116
Go ahead, you two.

464
00:23:34,116 --> 00:23:36,491
GARY GENSLER: OK, Nikhil or
Brian and then we'll move on.

465
00:23:36,491 --> 00:23:38,740
AUDIENCE: I had a question
around underwriting

466
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,220
based on cash flows.

467
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,490
So I wrote my paper
on alternative data.

468
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:44,470
And something that
came out was most

469
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:47,230
of the alternative
data lending firms are

470
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,620
focused on small businesses.

471
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:53,710
So the Amazon example that you
gave is for their suppliers.

472
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,510
Is there regulation
in the US that's

473
00:23:55,510 --> 00:24:00,160
preventing a cash-flow-based
underwriting for customers?

474
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:04,470
Because countries like
Kenya have it with M-Shwari.

475
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:07,480
Baidu piloted
something with Zest AI.

476
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,690
So just curious, what's limiting
cash-flow-based underwriting

477
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:12,700
in the US specifically?

478
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,750
GARY GENSLER: I think
it's a great question.

479
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:18,220
I think it's not
just regulatory.

480
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:25,600
It's also that as
of now, as of now,

481
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,020
the folks they could probably
do the best cash flow

482
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:34,060
underwriting on us are
the banks themselves,

483
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:39,790
that Bank of America and Citi
sees your rent payment going

484
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:42,130
out, sees your Visa
payments going out,

485
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:45,070
and sees your wages coming in.

486
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:49,370
I mean, literally
the banks themselves.

487
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:52,870
And yet, they have not,
as I understand it,

488
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:58,360
yet done a full 360
cash-flow underwriting.

489
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,570
A number of them are enhancing
their credit card products

490
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:04,810
and enhancing those products by
taking the FICO scores and then

491
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:07,390
sort of like FICO plus a little.

492
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:10,300
But interestingly, the big
banks have collected together

493
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,700
and formed something
called Vantage,

494
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,620
which is a competitor to FICO.

495
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:19,000
And it's a sort of consortium
amongst some big banks.

496
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,690
But it doesn't fully
include the income side.

497
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:26,410
And I think it does relate to
some of the regulatory issues

498
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:28,120
here in the US.

499
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:32,080
In the earlier wave, in the
earlier wave of data analytics

500
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,580
in the 1960s--

501
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:36,910
remember, credit cards came
along in the '50s and '60s--

502
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,610
we passed two really
important laws--

503
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:43,120
one about bias, called Equal
Credit Opportunity Act,

504
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,080
and one about credit
reporting agencies.

505
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,260
These companies like
TransUnion and Equifax,

506
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:53,680
they're regulated under the
Fair Credit Reporting Act.

507
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:57,340
And a lot of banks,
they're just sort of

508
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,890
trying to work
through those issues.

509
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:02,620
And again, this sets up the
challenger bank discussion.

510
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:06,020
It's part of why challenger
banks around the globe--

511
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,960
they started more in Europe--

512
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,920
but the challenger banks around
the globe had an alternative.

513
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,900
This is one of the
reasons I think that they

514
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,240
have a bit of an alternative.

515
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,920
I think this is
where we're headed.

516
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:24,980
We will, as individuals,
be more looked at this way.

517
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,320
One little story-- there
was one other question,

518
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,165
Romain I'm sorry, who was it?

519
00:26:29,165 --> 00:26:30,205
TA: Brian.

520
00:26:30,205 --> 00:26:32,170
GARY GENSLER: Brian and
then one little story

521
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:34,722
close out alternative data.

522
00:26:34,722 --> 00:26:36,430
AUDIENCE: Could you
please talk about how

523
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:40,450
legislation, such as GDPR and
other similar legislation,

524
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:42,397
has affected this space?

525
00:26:42,397 --> 00:26:43,730
GARY GENSLER: So great question.

526
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:48,670
There's also privacy concerns
about sharing my data.

527
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:50,050
Now, we all share our data.

528
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:53,230
That sort of horse
is out of that barn.

529
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:55,660
But then society
sort of says wait,

530
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,540
what's your protection here?

531
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:05,170
You're at the forefront of this,
passes the GDPR, the General

532
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:08,320
Directive, and the
P is not privacy.

533
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,940
I'm sorry, I can't
remember the--

534
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,335
AUDIENCE: Protection something.

535
00:27:11,335 --> 00:27:13,840
GARY GENSLER: Protection
Regulation, data-- data

536
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,990
protection, that's right,
General Data Protection

537
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:18,280
Regulation.

538
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:22,730
And they passed GDPR, basically
the right to be forgotten,

539
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:24,820
the rights about your
information, the right

540
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:28,210
to basically review
it and so forth.

541
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:31,750
It has some similarities
to those laws that

542
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:37,000
were way back in the 1970s
called Fair Credit Reporting

543
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,090
Act, even, but a lot further.

544
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:43,420
And what these privacy laws,
and more recently in the US,

545
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:48,010
the California Consumer
Protection Act or CCPA--

546
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:52,030
we all got notices in 2019
and regarding from Google

547
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:54,550
and others about the CCPA.

548
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:58,510
What they've done is they've
leaned into an ability for you

549
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,960
to review your data and
potentially edit your data

550
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,780
and delete some of
what's being tracked.

551
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:10,330
It does raise some of
the R data protection--

552
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:14,770
General Data
Protection Regulation.

553
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:20,080
But it doesn't go to the heart
of whether using the data

554
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,980
is going to lead to
biased outcomes, which

555
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:27,550
is about fairness
and equal credit,

556
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:31,570
or whether you're going to be
regulated like a credit agency.

557
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:37,670
So I think the GDPR and CCPA
better protect the public.

558
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:41,380
They also raise some of
the costs and barriers

559
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,920
to entry in this field.

560
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,370
So there's some economics to it.

561
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:49,630
I think they might also tend
a little bit towards then

562
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:53,470
homogeneic outcomes, meaning
that all the banks will

563
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:56,380
be doing similar things
to protect themselves

564
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:59,450
in the regulatory environment.

565
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:01,190
So I think it's a consideration.

566
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:03,490
It doesn't necessarily
slow this down.

567
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:06,190
It's also an opportunity
for a fintech startup.

568
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:10,780
If you think you can
be GDPR-CCPA compliant

569
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:15,160
and still be a really talented
alternative data aggregator,

570
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,290
that's an opportunity for you.

571
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:20,650
If you're ahead of the
regulatory curve and lower

572
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:24,680
regulatory risk for
the other startups,

573
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,840
so that's an opportunity.

574
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,820
One little comment
on alternative data

575
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,420
that I like to mention--

576
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:33,890
and I don't remember where
I read this, so I apologize.

577
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:37,850
I can't quote this--
the study accurately.

578
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:42,740
But there has been
a study about credit

579
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:46,190
as it relates to
charging your phones.

580
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:48,460
And so I just pass
this along to you,

581
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:53,510
that if some alternative data
provider and alternative data

582
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:58,310
underwriter wants to
assess whether you or I are

583
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:04,170
good credit, apparently, if one
charges your phone every night,

584
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:08,952
we're more likely to repay our
credit card and personal loans.

585
00:30:08,952 --> 00:30:10,910
And if you don't charge
your phone every night,

586
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:13,100
that's fine with me.

587
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,120
That's totally fine.

588
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,990
But apparently, you're a little
bit higher risk for credit.

589
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:23,110
That's what one
survey has shown.

590
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,013
And I apologize.

591
00:30:24,013 --> 00:30:25,930
I just don't even remember
all the things I've

592
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:27,790
read, where I've breaded this.

593
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:34,290
And so what if some
challenger bank just tracks

594
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,300
whether you charge your phone?

595
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,550
By the way, that's
not hard to do.

596
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,210
It's easy.

597
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:43,820
These phones are really
quite sophisticated--

598
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:47,620
geolocation, tracking,
contact tracing, everything.

599
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,220
So let's talk about the
readings and everything.

600
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,570
I'm not going to dive into it.

601
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:53,835
But there were three readings
about challenger banks,

602
00:30:53,835 --> 00:30:59,130
neobanks, and some of the
challenges going forward

603
00:30:59,130 --> 00:30:59,910
in this field.

604
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:05,860
What is a challenger
bank or neobank?

605
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,807
And since we're--

606
00:31:06,807 --> 00:31:08,140
I don't want to run out of time.

607
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:12,630
Let me just sort of say
challenger and neobank are

608
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:17,320
often used interchangeably,
but they're actually--

609
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:21,106
to the more sort of specific,
they're a little bit different.

610
00:31:21,106 --> 00:31:24,650
A neobank is something
that is acting like a bank

611
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:28,490
but is not yet
registered or licensed

612
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:30,620
as a bank in its jurisdiction.

613
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:33,890
And a challenger
bank more technically

614
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:35,990
would be something
that has a license.

615
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:39,860
Now, most people use these
terms interchangeably.

616
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:42,380
But there's slight differences.

617
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,910
Do they have yet registered?

618
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:45,890
And challenger
banks and neobanks

619
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:48,560
are used to talk
about this thing that

620
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:52,550
happened in these last
seven to ten years.

621
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:55,130
I'm going in a little
bit talk about how

622
00:31:55,130 --> 00:32:00,050
this relates to the online
banking that came before it.

623
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:02,130
The pain points in
traditional banking--

624
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:04,950
we're going to dive into this
in a minute in a few slides.

625
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:06,360
So I'll hold off.

626
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:10,850
But those pain points about the
costs that the big banks have,

627
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:13,760
the bricks and mortar legacy
business that they have,

628
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,030
the legacy technology
are real and they've

629
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:20,630
provided some opportunity
to challenger banks.

630
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:23,930
And the question is how will
challenger banks and neobanks

631
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:25,470
affect the landscape?

632
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:28,740
So one is what is
this phenomena?

633
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,850
Two, why have they been
able to tap into this?

634
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:34,190
What's the traditional
bank's problems?

635
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:36,020
And three, what's it
mean for the future?

636
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:39,750
That's what we're going to
try to cover going forward.

637
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,390
So the challenges--

638
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:45,080
I mentioned a couple of them,
but look, we all know it.

639
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:49,790
In the US, there's about 78,000
branches still in the US.

640
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:52,520
That's down from about
82,000 or 83,000.

641
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,520
What will that number
be in 10 years?

642
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,620
It's not declining
leaps and bounds.

643
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:00,380
But particularly after
the coronavirus crisis,

644
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,120
whenever we get to the
other side of this,

645
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:09,530
whether it optimistically is in
months or more, realistically,

646
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:13,100
in a couple of years and we--
all this social distancing

647
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,860
starts to move
around and we start

648
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:21,440
to get out there, this 78,000
branches, do we need them all?

649
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,380
And yet surveys of the
public, still people

650
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:28,250
like to have a physical branch
for that occasional time you

651
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:29,920
go into a physical branch.

652
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,400
They have legacy technology.

653
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,480
The products themselves
are somewhat commoditized.

654
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,750
A mortgages a mortgage, by
and large, an auto loan,

655
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,250
and even a small business loan.

656
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:42,260
There's a certain
commoditization

657
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:45,200
of payments and credit.

658
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,880
And how, when you still have
4,000 to 5,000 banks in the US

659
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,070
and in many countries
still hundreds of banks,

660
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:54,770
how do they literally
compete with each other

661
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:58,970
on a product that is
somewhat commoditized?

662
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,220
Now, you might say that's
hard for the new competitor.

663
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,137
But the new competitor
then comes in and says,

664
00:34:03,137 --> 00:34:06,410
well, maybe I can only provide
something to the restaurant

665
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:09,170
business, or I can provide
something that is really

666
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:11,360
a great user interface.

667
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:15,290
And the cost and
fees are real, too.

668
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:17,600
The traditional
banking, not just

669
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,929
because of their branch network
of nearly 80,000 branches

670
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:24,800
in the US, but also because
of their employment,

671
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,080
also because of their fees--

672
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,120
a lot of the challenger banks
broke in by saying, listen,

673
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,780
we're not going to charge
you the same overdraft fees

674
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,250
or late fees.

675
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:38,989
And if you do a deep dive and
a deep study on one consumer

676
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:42,830
banking, a lot of the
revenue is on fees,

677
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:46,770
whether it's overdraft,
late fees and the like.

678
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:50,659
And so challenger banks
also said we can go in there

679
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:54,540
and try to challenge online in
a different way and, of course,

680
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,909
provide greater user interface.

681
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:58,910
I think, to Luke's
earlier question,

682
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:02,540
partly why challenger
banks started in Europe

683
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:05,470
was partly because of the
Payment System directive.

684
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:09,530
There was first PDS,
Payment System Directive,

685
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:12,890
what's now called 1 and PSD 2.

686
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:14,900
I think it's partly
because of the Payment

687
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:19,370
System directives, but
partly the 2008 crisis.

688
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:23,600
Now, Ally Bank here
in the US technically

689
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,030
was the first one in 2009 here.

690
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:29,300
But a lot of people don't
say that was the first one.

691
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,290
But that came after the crisis.

692
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:33,080
And then you saw
this spur of them

693
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,770
in the early teens
that came along.

694
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:39,290
And I think a lot of it
had to do with trust.

695
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:41,480
And the European situation
it was going through,

696
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:46,670
the European debt crisis, all
the way through 2012, 2013.

697
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:49,850
And you saw an enormous
number of these starting

698
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:53,720
between 2011 and 2015.

699
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:57,730
And so this is a little bit
the history of online banking.

700
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:01,640
And I take this from
FT Partners, which

701
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,500
is Financial Technology
Partners, which

702
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:09,140
is a small investment bank
started by a former Wall Street

703
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:11,240
banker, I think a
handful from Goldman

704
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,610
and maybe Morgan
Stanley and the others.

705
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:15,920
But we're not going to
go through each of these.

706
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,930
But the Bank of
Scotland actually

707
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:21,710
started to do online
banking back in 1983.

708
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:27,350
In essence, anything you think
is new has something way back.

709
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:30,630
Bank of America was
already online by 2001.

710
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:34,010
Yodlee, which is-- we talked
about Yodlee when we talked

711
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:35,750
about APIs--

712
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:38,540
had already been
in this business.

713
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:41,570
And ING, which was part of
a big insurance company,

714
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:43,700
started retail banking
in the late '90s.

715
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,110
The internet came along.

716
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:47,450
An earlier wave of
fintech developed

717
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:50,060
and online banking came along.

718
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:54,620
Most of it, most of it
related to traditional banks.

719
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:59,840
And the distinction that I
draw between online banking

720
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,390
and challenger banking--

721
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:05,660
it's a light distinction, but an
important one-- online banking

722
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:08,720
generally was
related to companies

723
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,570
that had bricks and mortars,
traditional business models,

724
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:15,200
generally-- not
always, not always.

725
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:20,540
And Mint was launched in 2006,
later acquired by Intuit.

726
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:23,510
That tax software
company acquired Mint.

727
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:27,320
ING, an insurance company,
has something that Capital One

728
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,320
buys for $9 billion in 2011.

729
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:36,490
So the earlier wave of
non-banking online banking,

730
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:40,310
non-traditional banking,
like ING Direct and Mint,

731
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:42,290
were acquired.

732
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:44,570
They were eaten up, taken up.

733
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:48,170
And Ally-- Ally was an
auto lending company

734
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:50,930
formed 100 years ago
by General Motors.

735
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:55,370
It was the first captive
auto lending company.

736
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:58,430
But this set this
stage to what if I just

737
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:01,640
started something that
never had a banking license,

738
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,770
never had a bricks and mortar?

739
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:05,750
It's just a start up.

740
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:09,200
I'm just going to go into
some of these cracks,

741
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,810
some of these opportunities
the traditional banks

742
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:14,900
are giving me-- costs, fees,
trust, user interface--

743
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,770
and I'm going to
start something.

744
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,800
And so what are the reasons?

745
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,870
And from a survey,
from a different group,

746
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:23,670
The Financial Brand,
these are just

747
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,740
some of the reasons
people are saying.

748
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:28,080
It's easy to set up an account.

749
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,600
I like the fees and the rates.

750
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,960
Better experience,
quality service, in one

751
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,270
survey a couple of months ago.

752
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:40,000
That's an opportunity as well.

753
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,520
Here's a list.

754
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,270
You can make the
list so much longer.

755
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:45,720
There's hundreds
of other companies.

756
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,370
But what I tried
to do in this is

757
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:51,360
sort of stick to around
the world different banks.

758
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,540
Ally Bank from 11
years ago, but look

759
00:38:54,540 --> 00:39:00,420
at the spate of startups
in 2013 to 2016 or '16.

760
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:04,990
Now, some of these are
new, like BigPay in India.

761
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:09,300
Some of them are multi-billion
valuation companies already,

762
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:13,440
like Nubank in Brazil,
started about seven years ago.

763
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,460
There's a bulk of them
from the UK, like OakNorth.

764
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:21,000
Now, Revolut is in
30 countries now,

765
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,820
one of the earliest and
largest out of Europe.

766
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:29,380
Some are coming from
other fintech space.

767
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:32,800
Like SoFi didn't start as what
people would traditionally

768
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,140
call a challenger bank.

769
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:38,110
SoFi kind of started as an
online lending platform,

770
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:40,120
not quite peer to peer.

771
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,400
But then SoFi is moving over.

772
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,130
You can put on this
list Betterment

773
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:47,350
that we will talk about
in the next lecture that

774
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:49,480
does wealth management.

775
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,870
Betterment is starting
to move into this space.

776
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:57,400
Plaid has started to say they
will move into this space.

777
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,440
And then WeBank is
an interesting one

778
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,080
that's really formed by a
bunch of commercial banks

779
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:06,580
in China that's saying
we're going to just have

780
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,890
an online platform.

781
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:11,440
Is it really part of those
commercial banks or is it

782
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,680
separately a challenger bank.

783
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,740
So I've got a lot going
on, and KakaoBank,

784
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:21,320
which is started by one
of the big tech firms.

785
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,080
I chose not to put
Ant Financial on here.

786
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:27,720
But you could arguably say
Ant Financial, part of Alipay.

787
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,740
I was trying to stick to things
that are really classically

788
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:32,960
called challenger neobanks.

789
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,280
So the vocabulary
is a little loose.

790
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,950
Most people, when they think
of challenger neobanks,

791
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,930
they think of Revolut in Europe.

792
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:43,090
If you want to study
a case closely,

793
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:47,390
look at Revolut,
now in 30 countries.

794
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:51,200
But a lot of other players
who try to get in--

795
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,320
TransferWise from
the payment space.

796
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,360
So some from the payment
space some, from the big tech,

797
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:00,290
like KakaoBank, some
from commercial banks,

798
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:03,200
some from investment banks, like
Goldman Sachs starts Marcus.

799
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,240
A lot going on.

800
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,620
Nearly every country--

801
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:13,490
Australia is represented
here, China, Southeast Asia

802
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:16,160
and the like.

803
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,320
But this sort of
gives you a map of it,

804
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,870
back to that FT Partners thing.

805
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:24,830
This blows it up even more,
just with their logos.

806
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:28,610
But you can see it's really
around the globe right now.

807
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:32,943
Kind of was emanated out of
Europe, populated out of the US

808
00:41:32,943 --> 00:41:34,610
then, and then all
of a sudden, you just

809
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:37,370
saw it kind of all
around the globe.

810
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:41,120
Brazil, enormous contributions
out of Brazil in the business

811
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:45,560
models as well and the like.

812
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:53,440
Paytm out of India as well, in a
sense, I should have mentioned.

813
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,240
Quite a sort of
interesting-- and this

814
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,130
will be up in Canvas, of course.

815
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:58,935
So what are their
product offerings?

816
00:41:58,935 --> 00:42:00,310
What are their
product offerings?

817
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:03,670
Well, any bank has the same sort
of list of product offerings,

818
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:04,570
of course.

819
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:08,200
And this is just one example,
again, from this FT Partners.

820
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,660
Checking and savings--
to be a challenger bank,

821
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:13,210
it's usually right
there, somewhere in debit

822
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:16,070
cards, credit cards,
checking, savings.

823
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:19,990
And basically, they would say
it was easy to an account.

824
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:21,970
And we will actually
pay you something.

825
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:25,270
Revolut, interestingly, started
in the cross-border payment

826
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:28,725
area and basically said
you could have an account--

827
00:42:28,725 --> 00:42:30,100
you can be in one
country and you

828
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:33,660
could have an account
in multiple currencies.

829
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:38,250
Traditional banking is a
single-currency product, partly

830
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:41,080
regulation, partly history.

831
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,630
But Revolut says we're online.

832
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:44,670
You can have
multiple currencies.

833
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:49,270
And we won't charge you all
of that cross-border cost.

834
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:51,250
One might say it started
as a payment company.

835
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:55,790
But it was really an offering
you accounts as well.

836
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:57,580
And this idea of
offering an account--

837
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:00,160
remember, the term neobank
and challenger bank,

838
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,770
often used interchangeably,
but neobank is something

839
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:05,050
that's not yet licensed.

840
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:08,290
You've seen a spate of companies
in the United Kingdom getting

841
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:10,660
licensed from 2016 to 2019.

842
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:13,900
Many that were not licensed
as traditional banks

843
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:16,330
then filed for their
banking licenses.

844
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:19,870
And you've seen that
happening along the way.

845
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:23,350
When will SoFi, for instance,
get their banking license

846
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:24,880
in the US, so to speak.

847
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,100
You'll see that sort of
going along the way as well.

848
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:35,230
Romain I'm just going to pause
for questions just to see--

849
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:37,160
get a little engaged here.

850
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:40,250
And then I'm going to go
to their account base.

851
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,920
And we're going to talk
about their account base.

852
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:46,220
And then we'll turn to funding,
valuations, and a little bit

853
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:48,945
how traditional
banks are reacting.

854
00:43:48,945 --> 00:43:49,810
TA: Excellent.

855
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:51,227
Alessandro, do you want to go?

856
00:43:51,227 --> 00:43:52,310
AUDIENCE: Yeah, thank you.

857
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:53,360
Hi, Gary.

858
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:56,000
So my question is many
of these companies

859
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,410
that offer credit cards, they
often partner up with banks.

860
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:03,740
Is this because of regulatory
issues or a balance

861
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:05,110
sheet issues?

862
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:06,610
GARY GENSLER: It's
a great question.

863
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:07,670
It's really both.

864
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:10,700
And it's not just--

865
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,580
it's not just in the
credit card business.

866
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:16,340
You found that
marketplace lenders also

867
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:19,040
partnered up with banks.

868
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:24,650
The idea of entering
part of finance--

869
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:27,650
you always have a decision
in any business of buy

870
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:31,190
versus build or
rent versus bill.

871
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:32,960
You can do this with
your cloud storage.

872
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,990
Do I want to build my
data warehouse or rent it?

873
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:38,210
Well, by and large, if
you're a fintech startup,

874
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:40,460
you're going to rent your
cloud storage now, right?

875
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:42,650
You're not going to build
your data warehouse.

876
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:47,360
You might similarly rent
somebody else's balance sheet.

877
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:51,200
And so part of what you've
seen is about balance sheet.

878
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,110
You start a business and you
try to find some funding,

879
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:56,900
but you don't have
the funding yourself.

880
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,620
You don't have a balance sheet.

881
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:01,460
And you can get a
warehouse line of credit.

882
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:04,160
And you can use the asset
securitization market

883
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:08,540
as well to offload those credit
card receivables, those auto

884
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:10,490
receivables, student
loan, and, of course,

885
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:12,380
mortgage receivables.

886
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:14,522
And-- excuse me--

887
00:45:14,522 --> 00:45:19,390
[SNEEZES] and so you see
[SNEEZES] in some lines

888
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:21,550
of business,
particularly mortgages,

889
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:24,640
that what one might call
alternative finance--

890
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,250
Quicken Loans,
PennyMac, and others

891
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:29,800
have built very
significant-- well

892
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:34,660
over 50% of mortgages in
the US now, 50% to 60%,

893
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:39,970
originated by the non-banks
because they can readily

894
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:42,490
offload the balance
sheet issues.

895
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:45,760
But to your question, a lot
of it is also regulatory.

896
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:50,080
And in the credit card space
and in the peer-to-peer lending

897
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,350
space, without a
bank license, it's

898
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:56,920
hard to do all the
pieces you need to do.

899
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,340
And without kind of diving into
each of the regulatory reasons

900
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,990
why, you tend to--

901
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:05,223
so Amazon partnered with
Synchrony, for instance.

902
00:46:05,223 --> 00:46:06,640
And subsequent,
it looks like they

903
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:11,890
may have also partnered with
JPMorgan Chase on credit card

904
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:12,670
offerings.

905
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:14,830
And there are banks, like
Synchrony and others,

906
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:18,430
they will say we'll
basically white label.

907
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:20,460
Some of them, like
Synchrony, that's a co-brand,

908
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:21,940
on Amazon-Synchrony.

909
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:24,960
Some will say we'll just
be in the background.

910
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,640
And there are actually
some licensed banks

911
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:31,300
that make a business out of
servicing fintech companies.

912
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:35,200
And there's a whole
group of licensed banks

913
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,860
that in both Europe
and the US feel

914
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:42,800
that's a line of business
in and of itself.

915
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,815
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

916
00:46:43,815 --> 00:46:45,405
TA: Martin.

917
00:46:45,405 --> 00:46:47,580
AUDIENCE: Yes,
with so many banks

918
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:50,600
and with so many similar
credit offerings,

919
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:54,130
how do you see the
differentiation will happen?

920
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:54,680
And there--

921
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:55,888
GARY GENSLER: Great question.

922
00:46:55,888 --> 00:46:58,470
Look, this is a
very exciting space,

923
00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:00,150
but it's going to shake out.

924
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:07,860
I mean, it's hard to imagine
that they'll all be there.

925
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:09,470
There is one website--

926
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:12,890
I didn't choose to put it up
here-- that actually follows

927
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:17,690
the top 10 challenger
banks, by every six months,

928
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:21,880
they post who is getting
the most web traffic?

929
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:26,320
And part of it-- if you're
SoFi, and in one year

930
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:29,680
you get the most web traffic,
but three years later, people

931
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,740
aren't going on your
website, that's a problem.

932
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:34,780
I'm not saying SoFi
yet has that problem.

933
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:40,930
So the way that these
companies-- they've each

934
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:42,230
started a little different.

935
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:44,380
Some start in a
slice of a domain,

936
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:46,570
like Revolt is the cross-border.

937
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:50,290
Some come at it from
the open API side.

938
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:52,810
Some come from
the low-cost side.

939
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:57,970
They find one pain point and
they try to do that well.

940
00:47:57,970 --> 00:48:01,540
All of them that are successful
now pretty much started

941
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:03,402
between 2013 and 2018.

942
00:48:03,402 --> 00:48:05,110
So it's a little harder
to think somebody

943
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:06,490
is going to get in now.

944
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:09,100
But it might be a geography.

945
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:14,120
It might be like BigPay, which
I think is in Southeast Asia.

946
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:17,630
It might be a geography as well.

947
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:19,270
But I do think
there's going to be--

948
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:20,710
there's going to be shakeout.

949
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:24,010
And even amongst
the unicorns, those

950
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:27,610
that are valued over $1
billion, customers matter.

951
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:29,170
And maybe this sets up.

952
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:31,750
I'm going to show
you two competing

953
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:34,280
charts on challenger banks.

954
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,320
This is just Europe.

955
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,910
This is just Europe.

956
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:39,700
But you see the
growth in customers--

957
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:44,170
Revolt, N26, Monese
and so forth,

958
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:47,410
just this remarkable
growth of customers.

959
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:51,010
That's getting noted
by traditional banks.

960
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:56,230
You get 5, 10 million
customer accounts, that's

961
00:48:56,230 --> 00:48:58,640
a remarkable thing to happen.

962
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,760
We'll talk more about
this when we do asset

963
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,980
management in the next lecture.

964
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:08,050
But most of the biggest online
brokers, to give you scaling,

965
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:11,890
were somewhere between 6 and
12 million customer accounts,

966
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:19,330
E-Trade and the like,
TD Ameritrade, so forth.

967
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:22,830
So to give this on a scale
of customer accounts,

968
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:25,290
these started to
really get noticed.

969
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:27,420
And another customer
account chart--

970
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:31,200
different service, it's hard to
know whether these numbers are

971
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,440
accurate, but these are
self-reported by the companies.

972
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:37,980
This is by year of crop,
the 2013 startups--

973
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:42,420
Nubank, Aspiration,
Tandem, Chime.

974
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:45,580
Well, Nubank getting to 15
million customer accounts

975
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:48,960
or KakaoBank in Korea getting
to 10 million customers,

976
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:54,240
Chime, 6 million, 5 million
for MoneyLion, Revolut, 6,

977
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,400
and some other figures
show Revolut might

978
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,990
be closer to 9 million now--

979
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:03,980
these are significant
in and of themselves,

980
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:05,100
that they can get to that.

981
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:07,930
So part of a business model--

982
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:09,980
you can see hundreds
of challenger banks.

983
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:15,720
But many of them still only have
100,000 to 400,000 accounts.

984
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,490
And that's a great
start, but you've

985
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:20,560
got to kind of get further.

986
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,440
And the venture
capitalists behind it

987
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,900
have to decide what's
their exit strategy?

988
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:26,820
Can you sell this to
somebody else who's

989
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:29,890
trying to get a foothold
in this space or not?

990
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:32,640
Stash, by the way,
that's listed here

991
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:36,660
is more in the online
brokerage business than it

992
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:38,050
on an online banking.

993
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:41,170
So I chose not to
list it earlier.

994
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:44,730
Tandem, only half a
million customers,

995
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:47,010
is a really big one in the UK.

996
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:51,540
But Starling Bank and
Revolut and Monzo are bigger.

997
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:53,940
So how does Tandem
break through when

998
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:58,050
you've got four or five that
are bigger, just as an example,

999
00:50:58,050 --> 00:51:00,320
in the UK?

1000
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:03,300
And so then valuations--

1001
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,980
and it's really hard to
get behind valuations.

1002
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:10,237
All of this is before
the corona crisis.

1003
00:51:10,237 --> 00:51:11,820
Some of these are
going to be winners.

1004
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:16,050
Some of them are going to
be losers, this one taken

1005
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:19,620
from a Forbes article
in late 2019 based

1006
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:24,140
on PitchBook Data from
their last funding round.

1007
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:26,600
Now, Nubank-- look,
let's go back.

1008
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:30,680
Nubank, 15 or so
million customers--

1009
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:34,010
Nubank's been the big
success story here.

1010
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:37,460
Revolut, if that's a true number
from their last funding round,

1011
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:43,750
that seems a little out of
what the customer numbers are.

1012
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:46,700
It might be an
out-of-date figure.

1013
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:47,930
Valuations aren't clear.

1014
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:49,860
This is not stock
market valuation.

1015
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:52,760
So I'm going to give you
another take on this as well,

1016
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,980
is this is the actual funding--

1017
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:57,530
back to the FT Partners survey--

1018
00:51:57,530 --> 00:52:01,070
this is actual funding that
these companies have done

1019
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:05,200
and then what they call
pre-money valuations of Nubank

1020
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,350
and Chime and some
of the others.

1021
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:11,690
So these are not insignificant
players in the market.

1022
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:14,480
If you're thinking about going
to work for one of these,

1023
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,090
it would be an
exciting career path.

1024
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:21,200
But even the Nubanks
and Chimes and N26s

1025
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:25,490
have to figure out how they stay
viable, how they stay vibrant

1026
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:32,338
against the traditional players
and the big tech companies.

1027
00:52:32,338 --> 00:52:34,130
And if you're all the
way at the other end,

1028
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:35,780
if you're a company like Dave--

1029
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:39,140
Dave is thought of as
just maybe a unicorn

1030
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:41,750
and it's only raised 76 million.

1031
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:44,600
Now, that number
may or may not--

1032
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:48,920
but if you're Dave and you're
there with a couple employees,

1033
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:51,020
will it be there in
three years or not?

1034
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:52,528
What's their exit strategy?

1035
00:52:52,528 --> 00:52:54,320
So I think you've raised
the right question

1036
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,970
about all of these.

1037
00:52:56,970 --> 00:53:02,690
And the history of banking is we
don't-- we do have 5,000 6,000

1038
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:03,680
or so in the US.

1039
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,510
But they're community banks.

1040
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:09,660
They locally serve and really
work hard in their communities.

1041
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:11,240
They know their
business community.

1042
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:11,900
They know that.

1043
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:13,820
And they have some
bricks and mortars.

1044
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:18,130
In an online space, we know
that network effects matter.

1045
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:21,700
And with network effects online,
how many of these will exist

1046
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:23,920
is a great question.

1047
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,350
Romain one more
slide on funding,

1048
00:53:27,350 --> 00:53:30,980
but questions is I thought
this was kind of interesting.

1049
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:32,760
I don't necessarily
subscribe to it.

1050
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:35,810
But they-- this one site
sort of said let's take

1051
00:53:35,810 --> 00:53:38,240
a look at the funding numbers.

1052
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:43,010
What are their funding
numbers and how many customers

1053
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:44,070
they have?

1054
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:48,600
So if you take what their last
valuation number is divided

1055
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,510
by their customers, and they
come up with this concept,

1056
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:55,510
that customers are
worth about $730 apiece,

1057
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:59,190
if you just average everything,
you divide their valuation

1058
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:02,680
by their customer count.

1059
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,600
It doesn't work perfectly.

1060
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:05,600
It absolutely doesn't.

1061
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:10,890
But you can get a sense of this
is about an account aggregation

1062
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:12,060
model.

1063
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:14,770
Can you build accounts,
get to a million?

1064
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:18,360
Can you get to 5 or 10
million and actually service

1065
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:18,900
and provide?

1066
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:21,210
So what's happening is
a lot of these companies

1067
00:54:21,210 --> 00:54:23,340
are negative funding.

1068
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:25,980
By negative funding,
what they're really doing

1069
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:31,220
is they're offering
products to the public,

1070
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:34,100
but they're not covering
all of their costs.

1071
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:38,420
They might be offering
interest rates on the deposits.

1072
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:45,620
They might be having lower
costs and fees, lower late fees

1073
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:47,660
and account maintenance fees.

1074
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:49,370
They might not have
account maintenance.

1075
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:52,640
A lot of these will allow you to
have in essence micro payments

1076
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,440
and micro accounts.

1077
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:57,140
But how they're funding that
is the venture capitalists

1078
00:54:57,140 --> 00:55:00,020
are funding it, basically,
because what they're trying

1079
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:02,630
to do is build valuation.

1080
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:06,830
Their whole model is about
building value and then

1081
00:55:06,830 --> 00:55:12,470
exiting somehow and judging
when to do that exit.

1082
00:55:12,470 --> 00:55:16,970
Now, some of them will
get to be income positive.

1083
00:55:16,970 --> 00:55:21,560
But those that right now aren't
in the corona environment,

1084
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:25,670
coronavirus crisis we're
in, there's a new term

1085
00:55:25,670 --> 00:55:29,540
that you'll hear amongst
venture capitalists, is runway.

1086
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:32,960
How much runway
does a company have?

1087
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:37,070
Did its last funding round,
did they raise enough money

1088
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:42,710
to sustain them for six
months more or two years more?

1089
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:45,650
And a lot relates to one was
their last funding round?

1090
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:48,080
If their last funding round
was in the last six months

1091
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:51,345
and they have enough
runway, enough cash

1092
00:55:51,345 --> 00:55:56,210
so that their cash burn, they
can last two or three years,

1093
00:55:56,210 --> 00:56:00,412
that's more optimistic than
if their runway is six months

1094
00:56:00,412 --> 00:56:02,120
and they haven't done
their last funding.

1095
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,560
It's been a year ago.

1096
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:07,060
They did their A round, but
they haven't done their B round.

1097
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:10,240
And they've done their C round,
haven't done their D round.

1098
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,370
And, in essence,
they have to-- a lot

1099
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:14,830
of these companies in the
middle of the coronavirus crisis

1100
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:20,710
have to figure out how
to extend their runway,

1101
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:23,260
maybe do a suboptimal
new funding

1102
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:27,520
round that doesn't
boost their valuation,

1103
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,920
merge or consolidate.

1104
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:34,340
So it's also a challenging
time, depending upon what

1105
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:35,990
they hadn't anticipated--

1106
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:37,670
quote, how much
runway they have,

1107
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:40,350
when was their last
funding round and the like,

1108
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:44,340
and have they gone
cash-flow positive?

1109
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:46,220
Most of these have
not necessarily

1110
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:48,635
gone cash-flow positive.

1111
00:56:48,635 --> 00:56:50,510
Romain I'll pause for
questions, and then I'm

1112
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:53,287
going to talk about
traditional banks.

1113
00:56:53,287 --> 00:56:54,620
TA: So you almost just answered.

1114
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:56,450
We had a question
from Alida in the chat

1115
00:56:56,450 --> 00:57:00,238
asking whether this
model is profitable.

1116
00:57:00,238 --> 00:57:03,850
GARY GENSLER: Alida it is
profitable in terms of selling

1117
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:06,670
equity to venture capitalists.

1118
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:09,100
It is profitable for
some of the banks that

1119
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:14,030
have been sold even earlier
times to traditional banks.

1120
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:19,800
And for some on bottom line has
crossed over and is profitable.

1121
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:23,490
But we don't have financials
for the hundreds of challenger

1122
00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:24,660
and neobanks.

1123
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:29,790
But by and large, most,
before the coronavirus crisis,

1124
00:57:29,790 --> 00:57:33,680
would have been in a
negative earnings space.

1125
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:36,180
And what they were trying
to do is basically build

1126
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:39,870
digital footprint,
build customer base

1127
00:57:39,870 --> 00:57:41,610
to get to that
first half million,

1128
00:57:41,610 --> 00:57:43,110
to get to that first
million, to get

1129
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:45,410
to the 5 and 10 million round.

1130
00:57:45,410 --> 00:57:49,290
You get 5 or 10 million
customers, what you've built

1131
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:52,050
is you've built a valuable
thing that somebody else might

1132
00:57:52,050 --> 00:57:53,700
want to buy.

1133
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:56,310
And you've tended-- you've
tended to then to get

1134
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:57,840
to cash-flow positive by then.

1135
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,830
But I don't have the financials.

1136
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:01,770
I wouldn't be able
to tell you which

1137
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:07,140
ones of these small players
are yet cash-flow positive.

1138
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:08,430
I will say this--

1139
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:10,830
three to six months
from now, more of them

1140
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:12,480
will consolidate,
go out of business,

1141
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,430
or get cash-flow positive.

1142
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:20,200
They'll have a need to, as
I say, extend that runway.

1143
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:25,190
And then we have Carlos
with his anecdote.

1144
00:58:25,190 --> 00:58:26,820
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I have--

1145
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:31,230
I have a question as it pertains
to these banks in developed

1146
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:32,470
versus developing markets.

1147
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:33,990
And I guess it's
for two reasons.

1148
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:37,080
One is that on one
end, the extent

1149
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:40,138
of the unbanked or
underbanked population in--

1150
00:58:40,138 --> 00:58:42,680
and especially because when you
showed the valuations, right,

1151
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:45,720
Nubank is by far an outlier
in a country like Brazil.

1152
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:48,120
So one is that probably
a lot of people

1153
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:49,830
that are clients
of Nubank did not

1154
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:53,486
previously have bank accounts or
were significantly underbanked.

1155
00:58:53,486 --> 00:58:55,820
And in a moment like right
now with the corona crisis,

1156
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:58,320
I mean, they're going to need
these accounts more than ever,

1157
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:01,920
whereas people using neobanks
in developed markets,

1158
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,480
like the United
States, arguably,

1159
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:04,980
in a lower-interest-rate
environment

1160
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:07,950
might be less prompted or less
interested in actually holding

1161
00:59:07,950 --> 00:59:09,810
onto these accounts,
versus what they

1162
00:59:09,810 --> 00:59:11,082
can use in traditional banks.

1163
00:59:11,082 --> 00:59:12,540
GARY GENSLER: I
think you're right.

1164
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:17,450
But there's one other
aspect that you imply,

1165
00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:19,380
but you didn't explicitly say.

1166
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:21,780
It's the cost structure and
the competitive structure

1167
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:23,140
in the countries.

1168
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:24,120
So taking Brazil--

1169
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:28,980
Brazil is a very
high-cost banking sector.

1170
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:32,730
It has a lot of historic
reasons about the concentration.

1171
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:35,100
It has to do with the
government involvement.

1172
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:38,760
But of not just Latin
America, but around the globe,

1173
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:42,060
it has, if not the
highest, one of the highest

1174
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:43,440
net-interest margin.

1175
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:46,320
This is the margin that
the traditional banks,

1176
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:50,550
like Itaú and others, are able
to charge between what they

1177
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:52,590
lend money at and what
they borrow money.

1178
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:54,720
That's called the
net interest margin.

1179
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:58,830
And if in the US and even
in Mexico and Canada,

1180
00:59:58,830 --> 01:00:02,040
we're running, give or take,
around 300 basis points,

1181
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:04,590
meaning what you pay a
depositor versus what

1182
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:06,810
you lend on the other side.

1183
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:08,940
In Brazil, it's
multiples of that.

1184
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:13,160
Even for high-grade corporate
borrowers, it's more than that.

1185
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:16,440
But for small, medium-sized
businesses and the public,

1186
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:20,130
it's close to 10 times
that, meaning it's

1187
01:00:20,130 --> 01:00:25,770
20% to 30% net interest
margins for a certain sector

1188
01:00:25,770 --> 01:00:26,950
of the market.

1189
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:30,720
So I think Nubank and the
four or five others in Brazil

1190
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:37,270
had an opportunity because it's
a highly inefficient consumer

1191
01:00:37,270 --> 01:00:40,180
banking and small and
medium-sized banking market.

1192
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:43,780
And recall from
our last class, I

1193
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:46,510
said that fintech companies
have largely focused

1194
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:50,420
on the household sector, whether
it's mortgages, personal loans,

1195
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:53,000
credit cards, and the like.

1196
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:57,170
They've focused on the consumer
sector of savings accounts

1197
01:00:57,170 --> 01:01:00,360
and credit card
provisions and the like.

1198
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:02,760
And they focused on small
and medium-sized business.

1199
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:04,020
They're not trying to compete.

1200
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:07,110
Nubank is not trying to
compete with Itaú about the big

1201
01:01:07,110 --> 01:01:08,460
corporate lending.

1202
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:10,540
And they're not going
to compete in Brazil,

1203
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:13,230
as about half of the-- half
of the lending at the big

1204
01:01:13,230 --> 01:01:17,340
corporate level is from
basically government-banked--

1205
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:20,320
government-backed banks.

1206
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:23,160
So I think when you look
at the developed world--

1207
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:27,060
the Europe, the
US, and so forth--

1208
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:31,710
we have challenges in our
banking system, but they're--

1209
01:01:31,710 --> 01:01:35,190
it's around those
pain points I talked

1210
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:38,490
about earlier about legacy
systems and legacy user

1211
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:42,190
interfaces and sometimes
high fees and so forth.

1212
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:44,250
But in every country,
you have to look

1213
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:48,060
at what's the inefficiency of
the current traditional banking

1214
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:48,960
system?

1215
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:52,620
And is online banking,
is that an opportunity

1216
01:01:52,620 --> 01:02:00,030
to shed a costly branch network,
shed costly legacy systems,

1217
01:02:00,030 --> 01:02:04,200
or, frankly, just do
it better, cheaper?

1218
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,750
Ultimately, that's what it is
about being an entrepreneur.

1219
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:10,710
Can you do a better,
cheaper, faster?

1220
01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:15,430
And so how have the
traditional banks reacted?

1221
01:02:15,430 --> 01:02:17,440
They're not staying still.

1222
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:20,410
All the way back from the
online banking movement,

1223
01:02:20,410 --> 01:02:24,280
they were right foursquare
in the online banking

1224
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:27,490
movement of the 1990s
to the late noughts.

1225
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:29,620
What have they done
in the last decade?

1226
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:32,320
They've started to say maybe
we have to rebrand and do

1227
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:33,400
something different.

1228
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:35,395
Goldman Sachs is not the
only one with Marcus.

1229
01:02:35,395 --> 01:02:37,180
Now, Goldman Sachs is
an investment bank.

1230
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:39,850
They were not
protecting their brand.

1231
01:02:39,850 --> 01:02:45,070
But, as I said, Cap One in 2011
bought this big ING Direct.

1232
01:02:45,070 --> 01:02:49,600
Cap One said oh, for $9 billion,
we can move to this other area.

1233
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:53,950
But then others are starting
to have named branded products.

1234
01:02:53,950 --> 01:02:56,920
JPMorgan and others
are saying we maybe

1235
01:02:56,920 --> 01:03:03,100
should do something that
looks like an online--

1236
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:06,880
we'll even use a different
name and call it something else

1237
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:08,260
and react.

1238
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:14,440
So I wouldn't count out any of
these big traditional banks.

1239
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:16,300
And where we are
in three or five

1240
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:17,680
years is going to
be interesting.

1241
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:21,930
I also would encourage
you to think big tech.

1242
01:03:21,930 --> 01:03:25,060
Apple Credit Card is not
quite a challenger bank.

1243
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:28,450
Amazon Prime is not
quite a challenger bank.

1244
01:03:28,450 --> 01:03:33,550
But when do they, like Alibaba,
file for a banking license,

1245
01:03:33,550 --> 01:03:39,240
like Alibaba did and got
Ant Financial, like in Korea

1246
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:47,430
Kakao has done and already is
just getting huge market share?

1247
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:54,020
So I don't think that's too
much in our distant future.

1248
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:58,070
I think that's near term,
that we'll see that.

1249
01:03:58,070 --> 01:04:00,140
Now, we have different
traditions in the US.

1250
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:02,780
We have a tradition,
both in culture

1251
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:05,330
and embedded in law,
about separation

1252
01:04:05,330 --> 01:04:07,400
of banking and commerce.

1253
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:10,730
And we went through this
in the 1980s and 1990s,

1254
01:04:10,730 --> 01:04:13,040
when the department store
chains, like Walmart,

1255
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:14,360
wanted to get into banking.

1256
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:17,330
And they-- there was all this
sort of back and forth about

1257
01:04:17,330 --> 01:04:20,090
whether they can have banking
licenses, what type of banking

1258
01:04:20,090 --> 01:04:23,480
license, and industrial loan
companies and other things

1259
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:28,340
really in the intricacy of
banking law and licensing.

1260
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:30,980
We will have some of those
debates and challenges

1261
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:37,280
as well as, I believe, Amazon
and Apple and others and Google

1262
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:40,180
get further into this space.
