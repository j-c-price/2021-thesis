NANCY KANWISHER: So I'm going to talk today
00:23
about a couple of things.
00:25
I had a hell of a time constructing
00:27
a nice clean narrative arc to everything I wanted to say.
00:29
And so I finally just decided, the hell with it.
00:31
I'm just going to be honest.
00:33
There's several different pieces.
00:34
They don't make a narrative arc.
00:35
That's life.
00:36
I want to address what I see as a sort of macroscopic view
00:41
of the organization of the human brain
00:43
is giving us a kind of picture of what
00:46
I'm going to call the architecture
00:48
of human intelligence.
00:49
We're trying to understand intelligence in this class.
00:51
And so I think the overall organization of the human
00:54
brain-- in which we've made a lot of progress in the last 20
00:57
years--
00:58
gives us a kind of macro picture of what
01:01
the pieces of the system are.
01:03
So I'll talk about that.
01:04
And then I'll also-- if I talk fast enough--
01:07
do a kind of whirlwind introduction through the basic
01:10
methods of human cognitive neuroscience using face
01:14
recognition as an example to illustrate what each
01:17
of the methods can and cannot do.
01:19
So that's the agenda.
01:20
It's going to be pretty basic.
01:22
So if you've heard me speak before,
01:23
you've probably heard a lot of this.
01:26
Anyway, the key question we're trying
01:27
to address in this course is, how does the brain
01:29
produce intelligent behavior?
01:32
And how may we be able to replicate that
01:34
intelligence in machines?
01:36
So there's, of course, a million different ways
01:39
to go at that question.
01:42
And you can go at it from a kind of computational angle,
01:45
a coding perspective, from a fine-grained neural circuit
01:49
perspective.
01:49
But I'm going to do something that's kind of in between.
01:52
because those are the things we can approach in human brains.
01:55
And it's really human intelligence
01:57
we want to understand.
01:58
It's a sum of human intelligences.
02:01
A lot of it are things that we share with animals,
02:04
but some of it is not.
02:05
And so I think it's important to be able to approach this
02:09
not just from the perspectives of animal research, magnificent
02:14
as those methods are, but to also see what we
02:16
can learn about human brains.
02:18
OK.
02:18
So I'll talk a bit about the overall functional architecture
02:21
of the human brain.
02:22
What are the basic pieces of the system?
02:24
And then I'll get into some different methods
02:27
and what they tell us about face perception.
02:30
OK.
02:31
So at the most general level, we can ask whether human
02:34
intelligence-- as people have been asking for centuries,
02:37
actually--
02:38
whether human intelligence is the product
02:40
of a bunch of very special purpose components,
02:43
each optimized to solve a specific problem,
02:47
kind of like this device here, where
02:50
you have a saw for cutting wood, scissors for cutting paper.
02:54
Saws don't work that well on paper,
02:56
and scissors don't work that well on wood.
02:59
Or whether human intelligence is a product of some more
03:03
generic, all-purpose computational power
03:07
that makes us generically smart without optimizing us
03:10
for any particular task.
03:13
And just to foreshadow the answer,
03:15
as in all questions in psychology, the answer is both.
03:18
But we'll do that in some detail.
03:20
Before we get into that, who cares?
03:23
And I'd say, first of all, this kind of macro level
03:25
question about functional components of the human mind
03:28
and brain matters for a bunch of reasons.
03:31
First of all, I just think it's one of the most basic questions
03:33
we can ask about ourselves-- about who we are--
03:37
is to ask what the basic pieces are of our minds.
03:42
Second, more pragmatically, this kind of divide and conquer
03:47
research strategy has been effective in lots
03:49
of different fields that are trying
03:51
to understand a complex system.
03:52
What do you do with this incredibly complex system,
03:55
where you just can't even figure out how to get started?
03:57
Well, one sensible way to get started
03:59
is first figure out what its pieces are and then
04:02
maybe try to figure out how each of the pieces work.
04:04
And then maybe some day, maybe not in my lifetime,
04:06
figure out how they all work together
04:08
in some coordinated fashion.
04:12
And third, somewhat more subtly, of course, we
04:15
want to know not just what the pieces are,
04:17
but what the computations that are performed in each
04:20
of those pieces and what the representations extracted
04:23
in each piece are.
04:25
And I think even just a functional characterization
04:28
of the scope of a particular brain region
04:31
already gives us some important clues
04:32
about the kinds of computations that go on there.
04:35
So if we find that there's a part of the brain that's
04:37
primarily involved in face recognition,
04:40
not in reading visually presented words,
04:42
recognizing scenes, or recognizing objects,
04:45
that already gives us some clues about the kinds
04:47
of computations that would be appropriate for that scope
04:51
of task.
04:52
So if you tried to write the code to do that,
04:54
you'd be writing very different code if it only
04:56
had to do face recognition versus if it also
04:59
had to be able to recognize words and scenes
05:02
and objects presented visually.
05:04
OK.
05:04
So that's my list of the main reasons.
05:07
And of course, there are heaps of different ways
05:10
to investigate this question, and I'll
05:15
mention some of those in the second half.
05:17
But I want to start with Spearman,
05:20
who published a paper in 1904 in the American
05:23
Journal of Psychology.
05:25
This article was sandwiched between a discussion
05:28
of the soul and an article on the psychology
05:31
of the English sparrow.
05:33
And in this article, Spearman did the following low tech
05:37
but fascinating thing.
05:39
He tested a whole bunch of kids in two different schools
05:43
on a wide variety of different tasks.
05:45
And this included scholastic achievement type things.
05:48
He got exam grades from each student
05:50
in a bunch of different classes.
05:52
And he measured a whole bunch of other kinds
05:54
of psychological abilities, including
05:56
some very psychophysical perceptual discrimination
05:59
abilities.
06:00
How well could people discriminate
06:02
the loudness of two different tones,
06:04
the brightness of two different flashes of light,
06:06
the weight of two different pieces of stuff?
06:12
And what he found-- well, before I tell you what he found,
06:14
what would you expect with this?
06:16
Should we expect a correlation between your ability
06:19
to discriminate two different loudnesses
06:21
and, say, your math score in grade five on a math exam?
06:27
Spearman's main result is that most pairs of tasks
06:31
were correlated with each other.
06:32
That is, if you were good at one,
06:34
you're good at the others--
06:35
even tasks that seemingly had very little
06:37
to do with each other.
06:39
And this is the basis of the whole idea
06:41
of g, which is the general factor, which
06:43
is what led to the whole idea of IQ and IQ testing.
06:48
And in America, we're very uptight about the idea of IQ.
06:51
Brits don't seem to have a problem with this idea.
06:53
They're very enthusiastic about the idea and always have been.
06:57
But aside from all the social uses and misuses of IQ tests,
07:03
the point is there's actually a deep discovery about psychology
07:06
that Spearman made from the fact that all of these tasks
07:09
were correlated with each other.
07:10
He didn't know what it was, kind of like Gregor Mendel inferring
07:13
genes without knowing anything about molecular biology.
07:16
Spearman just inferred there's something general
07:19
about the human intellect such that there
07:21
are these strong correlations across tasks.
07:25
OK, so that's g.
07:27
But less well known about Spearman's work
07:29
is he also talked about the specific factor, s.
07:34
And s was the fact that although the broad result
07:37
of his experiments was that most pairs of tasks were correlated,
07:40
there were some tasks that weren't so strongly correlated
07:43
with others, and that you could factor those out and discover
07:46
some mental abilities that weren't just broadly shared
07:49
across subjects.
07:52
And I think this kind of foreshadows everything
07:54
that we see with functional MRI.
07:56
There's a lot of specific s's, and there's also some g.
08:00
And you can see those in different brain regions,
08:02
as I will detail next.
08:04
Another method was invented by Franz Joseph Gall.
08:08
And he argued that there are distinct mental faculties that
08:11
live in different parts of the brain, which I think
08:13
is more or less right, as I'll argue.
08:16
But Gall lived in the 1700s, and he didn't have an MRI machine.
08:19
So he did the best he could, which wasn't so hot.
08:23
He invented the infamous method of phrenology.
08:25
He felt the bumps on the skull and tried
08:27
to relate those to specific abilities
08:29
of different individuals, and from this,
08:31
inferred 27 mental faculties.
08:35
My favorites are and amativeness, filial piety,
08:39
and veneration.
08:41
And so there's a kernel of the right idea,
08:44
but kind of the wrong method.
08:47
And another method that was a very early one
08:52
was the method of studying the loss
08:55
of specific mental abilities after brain damage.
08:59
And so Flourens, who's often credited
09:01
as being the first experimental neuroscientist,
09:05
went around making lesions in pigeons and rabbits
09:11
and then tested them on various things.
09:12
And he didn't really find much difference
09:15
in what parts of the brain he took out
09:17
for their mental abilities.
09:18
Maybe that's because he wasn't such a hot experimental--
09:21
he didn't have great experimental methods.
09:24
In any case, he argued that all sensory and volitional
09:27
faculties exist in the cerebral hemispheres
09:30
and must be regarded as occupying concurrently
09:34
the same seat in those structures.
09:36
In other words, everything is on top of everything else
09:38
in the brain.
09:39
So that was a sort of dominant view for a while.
09:44
People thought Gall was kind of a crackpot,
09:47
even though he wrote very popular books
09:49
and went around Europe giving popular lectures
09:51
that huge numbers of people attended.
09:54
The respectable intellectual society
09:56
didn't take him seriously.
09:59
In fact, the whole idea of localization of function
10:01
wasn't taken seriously until Paul Broca,
10:05
a member of the French Academy, stood up
10:08
in front of the Society of Anthropology in Paris in 1861
10:14
and announced that the left frontal lobe is
10:16
the seat of speech.
10:17
And this was based on his patient
10:20
Tan, whose brain is shown here.
10:23
Tan was named Tan because that was
10:24
all he could say after damage to his left inferior frontal lobe.
10:29
And Broca pointed out that Tan had
10:31
lots of other mental faculties preserved,
10:33
and it was simply speech that was disrupted.
10:36
And from this was one of the first respectable people
10:40
to argue for localization of function.
10:43
OK.
10:44
So this research program goes on.
10:47
And by the end of the 20th century,
10:48
there's pretty much agreement that basic sensory and motor
10:52
functions do exhibit localization
10:55
of function in the brain.
10:56
There are different regions for basic visual processing,
10:59
auditory processing, and so forth.
11:00
And that was no longer controversial.
11:03
But the whole question of whether higher level
11:05
mental functions were localized and distinct parts of the brain
11:10
was controversial then and remains controversial now.
11:14
And so the method I'll focus on is functional MRI,
11:19
because I think it's played a huge role in addressing
11:22
this question at this macroscopic level.
11:26
And I think you guys know what an MRI machine is.
11:29
In case anybody has been on Mars for a while,
11:33
the important part is its measure
11:34
is a very indirect measure of neural activity by way
11:38
of a long causal chain.
11:40
Neurons fire, you incur metabolic cost, and blood flow
11:46
changes to that region.
11:48
Blood flow increase more than compensates for oxygen use,
11:52
producing a local decrease rather than
11:56
the expected increase in deoxyhemoglobin
11:59
relative to oxyhemoglobin.
12:01
Those two are magnetically different.
12:02
That's what the MRI machine detects.
12:05
It's very indirect, so it's remarkable it
12:06
works as well as it does.
12:08
And it's currently the best noninvasive method
12:11
we have in humans in terms of spatial resolution, not
12:18
temporal resolution.
12:19
OK.
12:20
So many of you are already diving into the details of some
12:26
of the data we collected.
12:27
But in case you're on other projects
12:28
and are coming from other fields,
12:31
the basic format of the data in a typical functional MRI study
12:35
is you have tens of thousands of three dimensional pixels
12:38
or voxels that you scan.
12:41
And typically, you sample the whole set
12:46
once every two seconds or so.
12:48
You can push it and do it every second or less
12:51
under special circumstances.
12:53
You can have more voxels by sampling at higher resolution,
12:56
but that's a ballpark of the format of the kind of movie
12:59
you can get of brain activity.
13:02
OK.
13:02
So a few things about the method and its limitations,
13:06
because they're really important in terms of what you can learn
13:09
from functional MRI and what you can't.
13:11
So first of all, this is a timeline.
13:13
My x-axis, even though it's invisible, is time in seconds.
13:17
And so if you imagine looking at V1 and presenting a brief, say,
13:22
tenth of a second high contrast flash of a checkerboard, what
13:26
we know from neurophysiology is that neurons fire
13:30
within 100 milliseconds of a visual onset.
13:33
The information gets right up there really fast.
13:36
The BOLD, which stands for Blood Oxygenation Level
13:39
Dependent, or functional MRI response,
13:42
is way lagged behind this.
13:44
So the neurons are firing way over here in this graph,
13:48
essentially at time zero--
13:50
a tenth of a second.
13:51
But the MRI response is six seconds later, OK?
13:56
So it's really slow.
13:59
And that has a bunch of implications about what we can
14:01
and cannot learn from it.
14:03
So first of all, because it's so slow,
14:07
we can't resolve the steps in a computation for fast systems
14:14
like vision and hearing and language understanding--
14:17
systems for which we have dedicated machinery that's
14:20
highly efficient where you can recognize the gist of a scene
14:24
within a quarter of a second of one
14:25
it flashes on a screen in front of you.
14:28
And similarly, you understand the meaning of a sentence
14:30
so rapidly that you've already parsed
14:33
much of the sentence well before the sentence is over.
14:37
So these are extremely efficient rapid mental processes.
14:41
That means the component steps in those mental processes
14:44
happen over a few tens of milliseconds.
14:49
And we're way off in temporal resolution with functional MRI.
14:52
All of those things are squashed together on top of each other.
14:55
That's a drag.
14:56
That's just life.
14:57
We can't see those individual components steps
14:59
with functional MRI.
15:00
15:03
The second thing is that the spatial resolution
15:05
is the best that we have in humans noninvasively right now,
15:08
but it's absolutely awful compared
15:10
to what you can do in animals.
15:12
So I missed Jim DiCarlo's talk yesterday,
15:15
but those methods are spectacular.
15:18
You can record from individual neurons,
15:19
record their precise activity with beautiful time
15:22
information.
15:23
In contrast, functional MRI is like the dark ages.
15:29
We have, typically, hundreds of thousands
15:31
of neurons in each voxel.
15:33
So the real miracle of functional MRI
15:36
is that we ever see anything at all rather than just garbage,
15:40
because you're summing over so many neurons at once.
15:43
And it's just a lucky fact of the organization
15:46
of the human brain that you have clusterings
15:47
of neurons with similar responsal activities
15:51
and similar functions at such a macro grain
15:54
that you can see some stuff with functional MRI,
15:56
although you miss a lot as well.
15:58
16:01
The third important limit of functional MRI that comes out
16:04
of just a consideration of what the method measures
16:08
is that you can only really see differences between conditions
16:12
with functional MRI.
16:14
The magnitude of the MRI response in a voxel at a time
16:17
point is meaningless.
16:19
It might be 563, and that's all it means.
16:23
Nothing, right?
16:23
It means nothing.
16:24
It's just the intensity of the MRI signal.
16:27
The only way to make it mean something
16:29
is to compare it to something else--
16:31
usually two different tasks or two different stimuli.
16:34
And so you can go far with that, but it's
16:36
important to realize you can't train translate it
16:38
into any kind of absolute measure of neural activity.
16:41
It's only a relative measure of strength
16:45
of neural activity between two or more different conditions.
16:49
OK.
16:50
And the final deep limitation of functional MRI
16:54
is that we use this convenient phrase "neural activity."
16:57
It's very convenient, because it's extremely vague.
17:01
And fittingly so, because we don't
17:02
know exactly what kind of neural activity
17:04
is driving the BOLD response.
17:06
It could be spikes or action potentials.
17:08
It could be synaptic activity that doesn't lead to spikes.
17:12
It could be tonic inhibition.
17:14
It could be all kinds of different things.
17:16
Anything that's metabolically expensive
17:18
is likely to increase the blood flow response.
17:22
In practice, when people have looked at it,
17:25
it's very nicely correlated with firing rate--
17:28
with some bumps and caveats, so you can never be totally sure.
17:32
But it's a pretty good proxy for firing rate.
17:35
You just need to remember in the back of your mind
17:37
that it could be other stuff too.
17:39
The final, very important caveat is that functional MRI--
17:43
like most other methods where you're just
17:46
recording neural activity in a variety of different ways--
17:49
you're just watching.
17:50
You're not intervening.
17:52
And that means you're not measuring the causal role
17:55
of the things you measure.
17:56
And that's very important, because it
17:57
could be that everything you measure is just
17:59
completely epiphenomenal and has absolutely nothing to do
18:02
with behavior.
18:04
So in practice, that's unlikely that you
18:05
have all this systematic stuff for no reason,
18:08
but you need to keep in mind that functional MRI affords
18:13
no window at all into the causal role of different regions.
18:16
For that, you need to complement it with other methods.
18:20
So despite all these limitations,
18:22
I think functional MRI has had a huge impact on the field.
18:25
And admittedly, I'm biased, but I
18:27
think it's one of these things where
18:28
as it happens, we get so used to a result the minute
18:32
it gets published.
18:33
It was like, oh, yeah, right.
18:34
One of these, one of those, so what?
18:37
But I think it's important to step back,
18:39
so I made a bunch of pictures to show you
18:42
why I think this is important.
18:43
OK.
18:44
Here is Penfield's functional map of the human brain,
18:47
published in 1957, a year before I was born.
18:51
And he has six--
18:52
count them, six-- functional regions labeled in there.
18:54
You probably can't see them.
18:56
But it's the basic sensory and motor regions, visual cortex,
19:00
auditory cortex, motor cortex, speech appear in Broca's area,
19:05
and then my favorite is this word that says interpretive.
19:10
Nice.
19:10
OK.
19:11
Anyway, this was based on electrical recording
19:15
and stimulation in patients with epilepsy who
19:18
were undergoing brain surgery.
19:20
Actually a very powerful method, but that's where it got him.
19:23
He published this near the end of his career.
19:25
And that's nice, but it's pretty rudimentary.
19:28
OK, now, cut to 1990, immediately
19:32
before the advent of functional MRI.
19:34
And this is really crude-- the black outlines
19:37
are the basic sensory and motor regions.
19:40
And I've added a couple of big colored blobs
19:42
for regions that had been identified by studying patients
19:45
with brain damage.
19:46
So even from Broca and Wernicke, it
19:49
was known that approximately these regions were involved
19:51
in language, because people with damage
19:53
there lost their language abilities.
19:55
You get whacked in your parietal lobe,
19:57
you have weird attentional problems,
19:59
like neglecting the left half of space and stuff like that.
20:02
If you have damage somewhere to the back end
20:04
of the right hemisphere, you might
20:05
lose face recognition ability.
20:07
These things were known by around 1990, not much else.
20:10
That's basically the functional map of the brain in 1990.
20:13
That probably seems like ancient history to a lot of you,
20:16
but not to me.
20:18
OK.
20:18
Here we are today.
20:20
There's a lot of stuff we've learned, right?
20:22
There a lot of particular parts of the human brain
20:29
whose function has been characterized quite precisely.
20:32
Not in the sense that we know the precise circuits in there
20:36
or that we can very precisely characterize
20:38
the representations or computations,
20:40
but to the sense that we know that a region may be very
20:43
selectively involved, for example,
20:46
in thinking about what other people are thinking.
20:49
A totally remarkable result that Rebecca Saxe
20:52
who discovered it will tell you about when she's here
20:54
next week.
20:55
So that was completely unknown even 15 years ago,
20:59
let alone back in 1990.
21:02
And likewise, most of these other regions
21:03
were either known in the blurriest sense
21:06
or not with this precision.
21:08
So I think even though this is very limited,
21:10
and it's kind of step zero in trying
21:12
to understand the human brain, I think it's important progress.
21:16
And I think to push a little farther,
21:19
I'd like to see this as an admittedly very
21:21
blurry but still a picture of the architecture
21:24
of human intelligence.
21:25
What are the basic pieces?
21:27
What is it we have in here to work with when we think?
21:30
We have these basic pieces--
21:31
a bunch more that haven't been discovered yet, and a lot more
21:34
that we need to know about each of these
21:36
and how they interact and all of that,
21:37
but a reasonable beginning.
21:42
So that's my story here for fun.
21:46
This is me with a bunch of functional regions identified
21:49
in my brain.
21:50
And so the argument I'm making here
21:52
is that the human mind and brain contains
21:54
a set of highly specialized components,
21:56
each solving a different specific problem,
22:00
and that each of these regions is present in essentially
22:03
every normal person.
22:04
It's just part of the basic architecture of the human mind
22:07
and brain.
22:09
Now, this view is pretty simple.
22:12
But nonetheless, it's often confused
22:15
with a whole bunch of other things
22:17
that people think are the same thing
22:19
and that aren't, so it's starting to drive me insane.
22:22
So I'm going to take five minutes
22:23
and go through the things this does not mean.
22:26
And I hope this doesn't insult your intelligence,
22:30
but it's amazing how in the current literature in the field
22:33
people conflate these things.
22:34
So I'm talking about functional specificity, which
22:37
is the question of whether this particular region right here
22:40
is engaged in pretty selectively in just
22:42
that particular mental process and not
22:45
lots of other mental process.
22:46
That's what I mean by functional specificity.
22:49
That's a different idea than anatomical specificity.
22:52
Anatomical specificity would say it is only
22:55
this region that's involved, and nothing else is involved.
22:58
That's a different question.
23:00
How specific is this region versus are there other regions
23:03
that do something similar?
23:05
Also an interesting question, but a different one.
23:08
I'm going to go through this fast.
23:10
So if any of it doesn't make sense, just raise your hand
23:12
and I'll explain it more.
23:15
Yet another idea is the necessity
23:17
of a brain region for a particular function.
23:20
That's actually what we really want
23:22
to know with the functional specificity question-- is not
23:24
just does it only turn on when you do x,
23:26
but do you absolutely need it for x?
23:29
And so that's actually a central question
23:31
that's closely connected.
23:33
It's really part of functional specificities.
23:36
It's the causal question.
23:39
It's different from the question of sufficiency.
23:42
Is a given brain region sufficient
23:45
for a mental process?
23:46
Well, I think that's just kind of a wrong headed question,
23:48
because nothing's ever sufficient.
23:50
It's just kind of a confused idea.
23:52
What would that mean?
23:52
That would mean we excise my face area, we put it in a dish,
23:56
keep all the neurons alive.
23:58
Let's pretend we can do that.
23:59
I'm sure Ed Boyden could figure out
24:00
how to do that in a weekend.
24:03
And so we have this thing alive in a dish,
24:04
can it do face recognition?
24:06
Well, of course not.
24:07
You got to get the information in there in the right format.
24:10
And if information doesn't get out and inform
24:11
the rest of a brain, it doesn't house a face percept, right?
24:15
So you need things to be connected up,
24:19
and you need lots of other brain regions to be involved.
24:21
So let's distinguish whether this brain region is
24:25
functionally specific for a process from whether it's
24:27
sufficient for the whole process.
24:29
Of course it's not sufficient.
24:31
All right.
24:32
I know you guys would never say anything so dumb.
24:35
OK.
24:36
A question of connectivity--
24:38
so people often say, oh, well, this region
24:43
is part of a network, period.
24:47
And my reaction is, duh.
24:49
Of course it's part of a network.
24:51
Everything's part of a network.
24:52
In no way does that engage with the question
24:54
of whether that region is functionally specific.
24:57
A functionally specific region of course is part of a network.
25:00
It talks to other brain regions.
25:02
Those other brain regions may play an important role
25:04
in its processing, sure.
25:06
At the very least, they're necessary for getting
25:08
the information in and out and using it.
25:10
OK?
25:11
OK.
25:14
All right.
25:15
The final thing that people confuse it
25:17
with functional specificity is innateness.
25:20
This is a very different concept.
25:23
Just because we have some particular part
25:24
of the brain for which we make it really strong evidence
25:27
that it's very specifically involved in mental process x,
25:30
that's cool.
25:31
That's important.
25:32
That's completely orthogonal to how it got wired up
25:35
and whether it's innately specified in the genome
25:39
that whole circuit--
25:40
or whether that circuit is instructed
25:42
by experience over development, or as
25:45
in the usual case, very complicated combinations
25:47
of those two.
25:49
So just to remind you that functional specificity
25:51
is a different question from innateness.
25:54
And one way you can see that very clearly
25:56
is to consider the case of the visual word form
25:59
area, about which I'll show you some data in a moment.
26:02
The visual word form area responds selectively
26:05
to words and letter strings in an orthography you know,
26:10
not an orthography you don't know.
26:12
It's very anatomically stereotyped.
26:14
Mine is approximately right there,
26:17
and so is yours in your brain.
26:20
And it responds to orthographies you know.
26:23
If you can read Arabic and Hebrew,
26:25
yours also responds when you look
26:26
at words in Arabic and Hebrew.
26:28
If you can't, it doesn't, or it responds a whole lot less.
26:31
So that's a function of your individual experience, not
26:34
your ancestor's experience.
26:36
It has strong functional specificity,
26:38
and yet, its functional specificity is not innate.
26:41
So this idea that I'm staking out here
26:43
has become kind of unpopular.
26:45
It's very trendy to say, of course
26:46
we know the brain doesn't have specialized components.
26:49
So for example, here's from a textbook.
26:52
Scott Huettel-- unlike the phrenologists
26:54
who believe this very stupid idea that very complex traits
26:57
are associated with discrete brain regions,
26:59
modern researchers recognize that a single brain
27:02
region may participate in more than one function.
27:05
Well, he built in the hedge word "may," so we can't really
27:07
have a fight.
27:08
But he's trying to stake out this different view .
27:12
Lisa Feldman Barrett-- I haven't met her,
27:14
but she's driving me insane, most recently
27:17
by proclaiming all kinds of things in The New York Times
27:20
just a few weeks ago.
27:21
Quote, "in general, the workings of the brain
27:24
are not one to one, whereby a given
27:26
region has a distinct psychological purpose."
27:30
Well, she's got hedge words "in general."
27:32
We all have hedge words.
27:33
But basically, what she's reasoning from
27:36
is the fact that her data suggests that specific emotions
27:40
don't inhabit specific brain regions from the idea
27:43
that the whole brain has no localization of function.
27:45
Well, that's idiotic.
27:47
It's just idiotic, right?
27:50
So I hope that people will stop these fast and lose arguments.
27:53
But here's my favorite--
27:55
this old coot Uttal.
27:56
I know this is going to be on the web,
27:58
and here I am carrying on as if we are-- anyway, whatever.
28:02
This guy cracks me up.
28:04
He's been publishing.
28:04
Every year, he publishes another book
28:07
going after functional MRI.
28:09
Any studies using brain images that
28:11
report single areas of activation exclusively
28:13
associated with a particular cognitive process
28:15
should be a priori considered to be artifacts of the arbitrary
28:18
threshold set by the investigators
28:20
and seriously questioned.
28:22
You go.
28:24
So anyway, that's fun.
28:27
Anyway, my point is just that we should engage in the data,
28:31
right?
28:31
This isn't like an ideology, where we can just
28:34
proclaim our opinions.
28:36
There are data that speak to it.
28:37
So let me show you some of mine.
28:40
OK.
28:41
So what would be evidence of functional specificity?
28:44
There are lots of ways of doing it.
28:45
The way I like to do it is something called a functional
28:48
region of interest method.
28:51
The problem is that although there
28:54
are very systematic regularities in the functional organization
28:57
of the brain, each of these regions that I'm talking about
29:00
is in approximately the same location
29:02
in each normal subject.
29:03
Their actual location varies a bit from subject to subject.
29:07
So if you do the standard thing of aligning brains
29:09
and averaging across them, you get a lot of mush,
29:12
and yet there isn't much mush in each subject individually.
29:16
And so to deal with that problem--
29:17
and to deal with a bunch of other problems--
29:19
we use something called a functional
29:21
region of interest method.
29:22
And that means if you want to study a given region,
29:25
you find it in that subject individually.
29:27
And then once you've found it with a simple contrast-- you
29:30
want to find a face region, you find a region
29:32
that responds more when people look at faces
29:34
than when they look at objects.
29:35
Now you found it in that subject.
29:37
It's these 85 voxels right there in that subject.
29:40
Now we run a new experiment to test more interesting questions
29:43
about it, and we measure the response in those voxels.
29:46
OK?
29:47
That also has the advantage that the data you plot and look at
29:50
is independent of the way you found those voxels--
29:53
a very important problem in a lot of functional
29:55
neuroimaging, where people have non-independent statistical
29:58
problems with their data analysis.
30:00
If you have a functional region of interest that's localized
30:03
independently of the data you look at in it,
30:05
you get out of that problem.
30:07
It's also a huge benefit, because one
30:09
of the central problems with functional brain imaging,
30:12
which I think has led to the fact
30:13
that a large percent of the published neuroimaging findings
30:17
are probably noise, is that there are just
30:20
too many degrees of freedom.
30:21
You have tens of thousands of voxels.
30:23
You have loads of different places to look and ways
30:26
to analyze your data.
30:27
One of the things I love dearly about the functional
30:30
region of interest method is that you tie your hands
30:33
in a really good way, right?
30:35
So you specify in advance exactly where
30:38
you're going to look, and you specify exactly how you're
30:41
going to quantify the response.
30:43
And so you have no degrees of freedom,
30:45
and that gives you a huge statistical advantage.
30:47
And it means you're less likely to be inadvertently publishing
30:50
papers on noise.
30:52
OK.
30:52
So that's the functional region of interest method.
30:56
We've done loads of these experiments.
30:57
Here's just from a current experiment in my lab
31:00
being conducted by Zeynep Saygin.
31:02
She's actually looking at connectivity of different brain
31:04
regions using a different method I probably
31:06
won't have time to talk about.
31:07
It's very cool.
31:08
But in the process, she's run a whole bunch
31:10
of functional localizers.
31:11
And so we can look in her data at the response of the fusiform
31:15
face area to a whole bunch of different conditions.
31:17
So these are a bunch of auditory language conditions,
31:20
so, OK, not too surprising.
31:21
It doesn't respond very much to those.
31:24
They're presented auditorily, but these are all
31:26
visual stimuli here.
31:27
The two yellow bars are faces.
31:29
This is line drawings of faces.
31:31
This is color video clips of faces--
31:34
strong responses to both.
31:36
And all of these other conditions--
31:38
line drawings of objects, movies of objects, movies of scenes,
31:41
scrambled objects, words, scrambled words, bodies--
31:44
all produce much lower responses.
31:46
OK?
31:47
So I would say this is pretty strong selectivity.
31:52
It's been tested against lots of alternatives,
31:55
only a tiny percent of which are shown here.
31:58
As I mentioned before, it's present in more or less
32:01
the same place and pretty much every normal subject.
32:03
I think it's just a basic piece of mental architecture.
32:06
Now, this is a very simple univariate measure.
32:10
We're just measuring the very crude thing
32:11
of the overall magnitude of MRI response
32:14
in that region to these conditions.
32:17
There are legitimate counter-arguments
32:19
to the simple-minded view I'm putting forth,
32:22
and we should consider them.
32:23
I think the most important one comes
32:25
from pattern analysis methods, which I will talk about
32:28
if I get there.
32:30
And importantly, these data don't tell us
32:33
about the causal role of that region.
32:37
We'll return to those.
32:38
However, the point is, before we blithely
32:42
say it's not fashionable to talk about functional specificity,
32:45
we need counterarguments to data like this.
32:48
They're pretty strong.
32:49
And that's just one example, to show you just a few others
32:53
from Zeynep's paper.
32:57
OK, so this is what I just showed you,
32:58
but I'm in the same experiment.
33:01
We can look at other brain regions.
33:02
OK.
33:03
So this is a bottom surface of the brain
33:06
there, so this is the occipital pole, front of the head, bottom
33:10
of the temporal lobe.
33:11
That face area is the region in yellow in this subject.
33:14
This purple region is that visual word form area
33:17
that I mentioned, and here is its response magnitude
33:19
across a whole bunch of subjects,
33:21
localizing and then independently testing.
33:23
The purple bars are when subjects are looking
33:27
at visually presented words.
33:28
And again, all these other conditions--
33:30
faces, objects, bodies, scenes, listening to words,
33:34
all of those things-- much lower response.
33:35
33:39
In the same experiment, we can also look at a set of regions
33:42
that respond to speech.
33:43
I mentioned those very briefly in my introduction
33:46
a few days ago.
33:47
These are regions a number of people have found.
33:50
In this case, they're immediately below
33:54
or lateral to primary auditory cortex in humans,
33:59
interestingly situated right between primary auditory cortex
34:03
and language sensitive regions.
34:04
Right between is the set of regions that respond
34:07
to the sounds of speech--
34:09
not to the content of language, but the sounds of speech.
34:12
And so this is when people are saying stuff like,
34:17
"ba da ga ba da ga."
34:18
So they're just lying in the scanner,
34:20
saying, "ba da ga ba da ga."
34:21
And here's when they're tapping their fingers
34:24
in a systematic order.
34:27
Here's when they're listening to sentences.
34:29
Importantly, this is when they're
34:31
listening to jabberwocky gobbledygook
34:34
that's meaningless.
34:35
So no meaning, but phonemes--
34:37
same response.
34:38
That's what tells us that this region is involved
34:40
in processing the sounds of speech,
34:42
not the content of language, and load everything else.
34:45
So other things-- moving outside of perceptual regions,
34:50
you might say, OK, fine.
34:51
Perception is an inherently modular process.
34:53
There's different kinds of perceptual problems,
34:55
that make sense.
34:57
But high level cognition-- we wouldn't really
34:59
have functional specificity for that.
35:01
But oh, yes, we do.
35:03
Here are some language regions.
35:06
There's a bunch of them in the temporal and frontal lobe
35:08
that have been known since Wernicke and Broca.
35:10
But now, with functional MRI, we can identify them
35:13
in individual subjects and go back and repeatedly query
35:16
them and say, are they involved in all
35:18
of these other mental processes?
35:20
So this is now the response in a language region--
35:24
so identified, here's the response when
35:26
you're listening to sentences.
35:27
This is when you're listening to jabberwocky nonsense strings.
35:32
Here's when you're saying "ba da ga ba da ga."
35:34
It's not just speech sounds.
35:36
Here's when you're listening to synthetically decomposed speech
35:40
sounds that are acoustically very
35:41
similar to the jabberwocky speech.
35:44
It's just not interested in those things.
35:45
It seems to be interested in something
35:47
more like the meaning of a sentence.
35:49
And just to show you some other data we have on this,
35:52
this is data from Ev Fedorenko, who has tested this region.
35:57
Now, this is sort of roughly Broca's area,
36:00
the main mental functions that people have argued
36:05
overlap in the brain with language.
36:08
Namely-- sorry, this is probably hard to see here,
36:10
but arithmetic, so we have difficult and easy
36:14
mental arithmetic.
36:16
Intact and scrambled music in pink.
36:19
A bunch of working memory tasks--
36:21
spatial working memory and verbal working memory--
36:23
and a bunch of cognitive control tasks--
36:25
just kind of an attention demanding task
36:27
where you have to switch between tasks and stuff like that.
36:31
And here is the response profile in that region.
36:34
Reading sentences, reading non-word strings.
36:37
All of those other tasks, both the difficult
36:39
and the easy version--
36:41
no response at all.
36:43
That's extreme functional specificity, right?
36:46
It's not that we've tested everything,
36:48
there's more to be done.
36:49
But the first pass querying of do those language regions
36:54
engage in all of these other things that people thought
36:56
might overlap with language?
36:58
The answer is no, they don't.
37:01
And I think that's really deep and interesting,
37:03
because it means that this basic question that we all
37:07
start asking ourselves when we're young
37:09
is, what is the relationship between language and thought?
37:13
I know Liz disagrees with me somewhat on this.
37:15
That's because she's very articulate,
37:17
and she doesn't feel the difference between an idea
37:20
and its articulation.
37:21
I'm less articulate.
37:22
It's very obvious to me they're different things.
37:25
No, it's not the only reason.
37:26
She has data, too, and it'd be fun to discuss.
37:29
But I think there's a vast gulf between the two
37:33
in that many different aspects of cognition
37:36
can proceed just fine without language regions.
37:39
And actually, the stronger evidence for that
37:41
comes not from these functional MRI data,
37:43
striking as I think they are, but from patient data.
37:47
So Rosemary Varley in England has been testing patients
37:50
with global aphasia.
37:51
This is this very tragic, horrible thing
37:53
that happens in patients who have massive left hemisphere
37:57
strokes that pretty much take out
37:59
essentially all of their language abilities.
38:02
Those people she has shown are intact in their navigation
38:06
abilities, their arithmetic abilities, their ability
38:10
to solve logic problems, their ability
38:12
to think about what other people are thinking,
38:15
their ability to appreciate music, and so on and so forth.
38:19
So I think there's really a very big difference
38:22
between a major part of the system
38:25
that you need to understand the meaning of a sentence
38:28
and all of those other aspects of thought.
38:30
This is just showing you what I mean
38:32
by functional specificity--
38:34
what the basic first order evidence is.
38:37
And these are just the regions that we
38:38
happen to have in this study so I could make a new slide.
38:41
But for lots of other perceptual and cognitive functions,
38:45
people have found quite specific brain regions
38:47
for perceiving bodies and scenes, of course, motion.
38:50
The area MT has been studied for a long time--
38:54
regions that are quite specifically
38:56
involved in processing shape.
38:58
We've been studying color processing regions recently.
39:00
They're not as selective for color
39:02
as some of these other regions, but they're
39:03
very anatomically consistent.
39:07
And things I mentioned before in my brief introduction-- regions
39:12
that are specifically involved in processing pitch information
39:15
and music information, and as you'll
39:18
hear next week from Rebecca Saxe, theory
39:20
of mind or thinking about other people's thoughts.
39:23
And so there's quite a litany of mental functions
39:28
that have brain regions that are quite specifically engaged
39:31
to that mental function.
39:32
And each of these--
39:34
to varying degrees, but to some appreciable degree--
39:37
have corroborating evidence from patients
39:40
who have that specific deficit.
39:42
So that shows that each of these is
39:44
likely to be not only activated during,
39:47
but causally involved in its mental function.
39:51
And as I mentioned, there are actually good counter-arguments
39:55
to some of the things I've been making
39:56
that are worth discussing.
39:57
I think the pattern analysis data is the strongest.
40:02
Oh, and I do need to take a few more minutes.
40:04
Just like five or something?
40:06
OK.
40:07
So all of that's to say, so here's
40:09
roughly where we are now.
40:10
There are counter-arguments, but loose talk about, oh, there's
40:14
no localization of function in the brain.
40:15
You got to engage with us at first
40:17
and give me a serious counter-argument.
40:20
OK.
40:21
Finally, I want to say that it's not that the whole brain is
40:24
like this, right?
40:26
There are big gray patches where we haven't figured
40:29
out what it's doing, but there are also substantial patches
40:33
that have already been shown to be,
40:35
in some sense, the opposite of this.
40:37
Regions that are engaged in almost any difficult task
40:40
you do at all.
40:41
And I think this is a very interesting part
40:43
of the whole story of the architecture of intelligence,
40:45
so I'm going to take five minutes and tell you about it.
40:48
This work is primarily the work of John Duncan in England.
40:51
And he's been pointing out for about 15 years
40:54
that there are regions in the parietal and frontal lobe shown
40:59
here that are engaged in pretty much any difficult task you do.
41:04
Any time you increase the difficulty of a task--
41:06
whether it's perceptual or high level cognitive--
41:10
those regions turn on differentially.
41:12
And so that's why he calls them multiple demand.
41:14
They respond to multiple different kinds of demand.
41:16
41:21
Duncan argues that these regions are
41:23
related to fluid intelligence.
41:24
So remember Spearman, who I started with,
41:27
who talks about the general factor, g.
41:30
Well, Duncan thinks that basically, this
41:33
is the seat of g--
41:34
these regions here-- to oversimplify his argument.
41:37
There's multiple sources of evidence for that.
41:40
And one is, well, they're strongly
41:43
activated when you do classic g-loading tasks.
41:45
That's not that surprising.
41:46
They're activated in all different kinds of tasks.
41:49
More interestingly, he did a large patient study,
41:52
where they found 80 or so neuropsych patients
41:56
in their patient database.
41:58
And they identified the locus of the brain damage
42:01
in each of those patients.
42:02
And what they did was they measured post-injury IQ.
42:06
They estimated from a variety of sources pre-injury IQ.
42:09
And they asked, how much does your IQ go down
42:13
after brain damage as a function of one,
42:16
the volume of tissue you lost in the brain damage,
42:18
and two, the locus of tissue?
42:22
And basically, what he finds is if you
42:25
lose tissue in these regions, your IQ goes down.
42:28
If you lose tissue elsewhere, you
42:31
may become paralyzed or aphasic or prosopagnosia.
42:36
Your IQ does not go down.
42:38
In fact, he made a kind of ghoulish calculation
42:42
that you lose 6 and 1/2 IQ points for every 10
42:45
cubic centimeters of this region of cortex,
42:50
and almost nothing for the rest of the brain.
42:53
So this is kind of crude.
42:55
It's very imperfect what you can get from patient study,
42:59
but I think it's intriguing.
43:00
And so his suggestion is that in addition to these highly
43:04
specialized cortical regions that we
43:05
use for these particular important tasks,
43:08
we also have this kind of general purpose machinery that
43:12
makes us generically smart.
43:14
And I'm going to skip around.
43:15
We've tested this more seriously.
43:17
He did group analyses, which I don't like.
43:19
We did it in collaboration with him
43:21
with individual subject analyses,
43:23
the most precise measurements we could make, and boy,
43:25
is he right.
43:26
I mean, even to the voxel you can
43:28
find that these regions are engaged
43:30
in seven or eight very, very different kinds
43:33
of cognitive demand--
43:35
all activate the same voxel differentially.
43:38
So the basic story I'm putting forth here--
43:40
without the second half of my talk, I'm sorry about that--
43:45
is that at a macro scale, the architecture
43:48
of human intelligence is that we have these special purpose
43:50
bits for a smallish number of important mental functions,
43:55
not all of them innate-- maybe some of them.
43:57
In addition, we have some general purpose machinery.
44:00
There's loads more that we don't know
44:02
from the precise computations that go on in these things,
44:06
to their connectivity, to the actual precise representations
44:11
that you can see with the neural code if you could measure it,
44:14
which we can't in humans, to the timing
44:17
of these complex interactions, which of them are uniquely
44:20
human, which of them are also present in monkeys.
44:23
And I don't have time to go find the slide,
44:26
but one of the things we've been doing recently
44:28
is looking in the ventral visual pathway
44:31
at the organization of face, place, and color selectivity.
44:36
And what we see is that--
44:38
we is me and Bevil Conway and Rosa Lafer-Sousa.
44:43
Bevil and Rosa had previously shown
44:45
that on the lateral surface in the monkey,
44:47
you have three bands of selectivity.
44:50
So it goes face selectivity, color selectivity,
44:53
place selectivity, and three bands
44:55
on the side of the temporal lobe in monkeys.
44:58
We find this in humans.
44:59
You have exactly the same organization in the same order,
45:02
but it's rolled around on the ventral surface of the brain
45:05
in the same order--
45:06
face, color, place-- on the bottom of the brain.
45:09
So we think that whole broad region is homologous
45:13
between monkeys and humans.
45:15
It just rolled around on the bottom.
45:16
Maybe it got pushed over [AUDIO OUT] something.
45:19
And that's not exactly a novel argument.
45:21
Actually, Winrich wrote a paper suggesting this a while back,
45:24
and I think we're starting to see those homologies.
45:27
And the reason that's important is
45:28
that it means that all these questions we desperately
45:31
want to answer about the causal role, connectivity,
45:35
population codes, [AUDIO OUT] interactions between regions,
45:40
development-- all of that that we
45:42
can't answer very well in humans,
45:44
Winrich can answer in monkeys.
45:46
And after a break, he will tell you about all of that.
