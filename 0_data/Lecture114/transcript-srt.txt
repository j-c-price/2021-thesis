1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,029
 hey welcome everyone thanks for showing

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,029
 

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:09,269
 up on a Monday on the last day of the

4
00:00:06,019 --> 00:00:09,269
 

5
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:12,420
 conference I'm Sean parent I'm a

6
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:12,420
 

7
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:15,480
 principal scientist at Adobe given a

8
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:15,480
 

9
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,100
 number of talks over the years so I know

10
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,100
 

11
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,650
 a number of you I've spoken in a lot of

12
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,650
 

13
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,410
 conferences this talk is a little

14
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,410
 

15
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,930
 outside the talks I usually give it's a

16
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,930
 

17
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,599
 talk on the relationship between better

18
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,599
 

19
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,330
 code and a better human interface so

20
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:29,330
 

21
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,660
 it's a little outside points if we call

22
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,660
 

23
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:35,700
 better code talks I'll when I give a

24
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,700
 

25
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,460
 talk I like to give a talk that's

26
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,460
 

27
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,790
 related at least tangentially to what

28
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,790
 

29
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:44,309
 I'm working on and so yeah they asked me

30
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,309
 

31
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:50,370
 to give this talk a year or so ago at

32
00:00:44,299 --> 00:00:50,370
 

33
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:52,980
 meeting C++ and I gave it there and you

34
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,980
 

35
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,840
 human interfaces user interfaces are

36
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,840
 

37
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:58,969
 something I spend a lot of time with and

38
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:58,969
 

39
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,969
 then I spend a lot of time working on

40
00:00:59,260 --> 00:00:59,260
 

41
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:06,479
 Marshall asked me just before I came on

42
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,479
 

43
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:10,650
 about the art work what this actually is

44
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:10,650
 

45
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,729
 the brushstrokes I'm bringing it up only

46
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,729
 

47
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,350
 because every time I give a talk

48
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:13,350
 

49
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:17,780
 somebody asks where do you get your

50
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,780
 

51
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:20,460
 artwork well working at Adobe we have a

52
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:20,460
 

53
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:22,920
 collection of templates that branding

54
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,920
 

55
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,560
 puts out in updates every six months or

56
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:25,560
 

57
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,420
 so and so whenever I give a talk I go

58
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,420
 

59
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,170
 and I try to just pick one of their

60
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:31,170
 

61
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,970
 templates it's approved that matches the

62
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,970
 

63
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,460
 theme somewhat so since this is about

64
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,460
 

65
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:38,100
 human interface and design I thought

66
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:38,100
 

67
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:42,840
 this was a nice artistic piece to go

68
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:42,840
 

69
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:45,720
 with this talk human interface as we

70
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:45,720
 

71
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,820
 bump into all the time and they waste a

72
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,820
 

73
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,220
 huge amount of our time bad human their

74
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,220
 

75
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:54,119
 faces do I don't think we give enough

76
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:54,119
 

77
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,860
 thought about them just standing up here

78
00:01:54,109 --> 00:01:55,860
 

79
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:58,890
 before the conference the little device

80
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,890
 

81
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:02,100
 over here is a timer that I can see and

82
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,100
 

83
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,780
 as it was leading up to the talk the

84
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,780
 

85
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,210
 background went green to let me know

86
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:06,210
 

87
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,910
 that it was pre talk and the numbers

88
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,910
 

89
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:11,520
 went red to let me know that I was

90
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,520
 

91
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,690
 getting close to the time who knows what

92
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,690
 

93
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,150
 the problem with that is

94
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,150
 

95
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:17,620
 yeah if I were colorblind I don't think

96
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,620
 

97
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,630
 I would have been able to read it at all

98
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,630
 

99
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,550
 right I I mean it literally looked like

100
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,550
 

101
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:30,600
 a test you would take to see if you were

102
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:30,600
 

103
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:32,680
 colorblind so you bump into these things

104
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,680
 

105
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,390
 when I give a talk in the conference i

106
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,390
 

107
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,980
 also like to open things up for a

108
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,980
 

109
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,520
 conversation for the rest of the

110
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:36,520
 

111
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,500
 conference

112
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,500
 

113
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,810
 this is not a keynote I'm not leading

114
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,810
 

115
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,190
 off the conference but maybe this will

116
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,190
 

117
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:45,370
 give you some ideas of things to talk

118
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,370
 

119
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:49,530
 about during the day so these were talks

120
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,530
 

121
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:53,410
 that I'm not giving for various reasons

122
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,410
 

123
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:56,560
 better code design and ethics a question

124
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,560
 

125
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:58,960
 here is there a moral imperative to

126
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,960
 

127
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,470
 create better designs of better software

128
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:02,470
 

129
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:05,290
 better human interfaces I think it's an

130
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,290
 

131
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:07,560
 interesting topic the reason why I'm not

132
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,560
 

133
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:11,080
 giving this talk is because today

134
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:11,080
 

135
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,490
 specifically like at this moment I think

136
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,490
 

137
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,980
 there are much greater moral issues

138
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,980
 

139
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:20,590
 going on in the world so this would be a

140
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:20,590
 

141
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:25,510
 little trite futures are not monads or

142
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:25,510
 

143
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:27,430
 maybe not just mo Nance bresenhem's

144
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,430
 

145
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:30,640
 algorithm who knows what bresenhem's

146
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,640
 

147
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:31,840
 algorithm is yeah so I've been doing

148
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,840
 

149
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,950
 some interesting work with brother name

150
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:35,950
 

151
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,720
 algorithms and and much faster brezin M

152
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,720
 

153
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:40,330
 algorithms with no comparison no

154
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:40,330
 

155
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,800
 branches and I think there's an

156
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,800
 

157
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,540
 interesting talk there interesting

158
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,540
 

159
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:47,470
 history but I haven't finished the work

160
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,470
 

161
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:50,170
 so I'm not gonna give this talk yet old

162
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,170
 

163
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:51,790
 guy reminiscing my badge that I've been

164
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,790
 

165
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:54,430
 walking around with at the conferences

166
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,430
 

167
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:57,220
 how old is generic programming the

168
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,220
 

169
00:03:54,430 --> 00:04:00,760
 answer I will give you all now is 30

170
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,760
 

171
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:04,989
 years 30 years ago today or not today 30

172
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:04,989
 

173
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:07,600
 years ago this year Dave Mercer and Alec

174
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:07,600
 

175
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:10,030
 Stepanov published a paper titled

176
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,030
 

177
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:13,750
 generic programming that's where the the

178
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:13,750
 

179
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:15,160
 term generic programming was coined the

180
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,160
 

181
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,390
 number of people who I've had

182
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,390
 

183
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,310
 conversations with at this conference

184
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,310
 

185
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:20,020
 when I said it's 30 years old they're

186
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,020
 

187
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:23,289
 like oh well that's about two or three

188
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,289
 

189
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:25,180
 years before I was born 30 years ago I

190
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:25,180
 

191
00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:26,919
 worked at Apple and systems software

192
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,919
 

193
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,719
 group so

194
00:04:26,909 --> 00:04:28,719
 

195
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:32,340
 so there's lots that I can reminisce

196
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:32,340
 

197
00:04:28,719 --> 00:04:34,719
 about the old guy but today's tough

198
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,719
 

199
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:39,819
 we're talking about better code human

200
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:39,819
 

201
00:04:34,719 --> 00:04:42,039
 interface along this talk comes out of a

202
00:04:39,809 --> 00:04:42,039
 

203
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:44,409
 comment that Darren Adler I think Darren

204
00:04:42,029 --> 00:04:44,409
 

205
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:47,229
 now runs the safari group at Apple he

206
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,229
 

207
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:49,599
 and I worked at Apple you know 30 years

208
00:04:47,219 --> 00:04:49,599
 

209
00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:53,139
 ago fact he's one of the reasons why I

210
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:53,139
 

211
00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:54,639
 got my job at Apple I he made this

212
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:54,639
 

213
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:56,199
 statement at least this is to the best

214
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:56,199
 

215
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,490
 of my recollection but I actually sent

216
00:04:56,189 --> 00:04:57,490
 

217
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:01,810
 him this quote and he said yeah he

218
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,810
 

219
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:02,949
 remembers the conversation and he

220
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,949
 

221
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:05,620
 remembers saying something to this

222
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:05,620
 

223
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:07,930
 effect that's the purpose of a human

224
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,930
 

225
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:10,330
 interface is not to hide what the code

226
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,330
 

227
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:13,419
 does but to accurately convey what the

228
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,419
 

229
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:15,069
 code does okay what you're trying to do

230
00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:15,069
 

231
00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:18,339
 when you build a human interface is

232
00:05:15,059 --> 00:05:18,339
 

233
00:05:15,069 --> 00:05:21,759
 create a mental model in the users mind

234
00:05:18,329 --> 00:05:21,759
 

235
00:05:18,339 --> 00:05:24,310
 of what's going on under the hood okay

236
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:24,310
 

237
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,960
 all too often I see human interfaces

238
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,960
 

239
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:27,669
 where it's very clear that the designer

240
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,669
 

241
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,069
 of the human interface never really

242
00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:30,069
 

243
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:31,870
 talked to the engineer they never

244
00:05:30,059 --> 00:05:31,870
 

245
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:33,389
 understood what the constraints were or

246
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,389
 

247
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:36,189
 what it was they were trying to convey

248
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:36,189
 

249
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:37,990
 okay they were trying to create an

250
00:05:36,179 --> 00:05:37,990
 

251
00:05:36,189 --> 00:05:42,669
 illusion of how they wished it worked

252
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:42,669
 

253
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:46,419
 not of how it actually works and the

254
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:46,419
 

255
00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:47,649
 problem with that is those lies and

256
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:47,649
 

257
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:49,779
 that's what you're doing when you do

258
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,779
 

259
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:53,229
 that you are lying to the user about how

260
00:05:49,769 --> 00:05:53,229
 

261
00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:55,750
 the system works those lies don't hold

262
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:55,750
 

263
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:59,169
 up and they peek through and users

264
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,169
 

265
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:01,270
 create magical rules right right how

266
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,270
 

267
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:02,919
 many times have you talked with the

268
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,919
 

269
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:05,770
 family members kind of not in the

270
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:05,770
 

271
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:07,689
 industry and they will tell you like oh

272
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,689
 

273
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:10,389
 yes you know whenever I save this

274
00:06:07,679 --> 00:06:10,389
 

275
00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:12,009
 document I do this other thing and they

276
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:12,009
 

277
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:15,520
 might as well said you know I stand on

278
00:06:11,999 --> 00:06:15,520
 

279
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:18,210
 one one foot and Pat the top of my head

280
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,210
 

281
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:22,120
 because otherwise it doesn't work right

282
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,120
 

283
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:23,949
 right they're creating a little magical

284
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,949
 

285
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,659
 thinking trying to explain to themselves

286
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:25,659
 

287
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:28,389
 what it does because when they take the

288
00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:28,389
 

289
00:06:25,659 --> 00:06:32,860
 set of actions once at least it did what

290
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:32,860
 

291
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:37,509
 they wanted so we can't lie to the user

292
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:37,509
 

293
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:40,090
 so my goal is always don't lie I wanted

294
00:06:37,499 --> 00:06:40,090
 

295
00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:43,360
 to set a little context here

296
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,360
 

297
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:45,880
 because I think it's important whenever

298
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,880
 

299
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,820
 somebody gives a talk to understand what

300
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,820
 

301
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:52,720
 kind of world they live in

302
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:52,720
 

303
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:55,210
 this is Photoshop when I joined Adobe

304
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:55,210
 

305
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,220
 twenty-five years ago I started on this

306
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,220
 

307
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:59,560
 team and now I kind of loped back in my

308
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,560
 

309
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:02,230
 career in the last couple years and so

310
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:02,230
 

311
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:05,530
 now I'm working again with the Photoshop

312
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,530
 

313
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:08,140
 team this application how many people

314
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,140
 

315
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:09,910
 here have used it okay

316
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,910
 

317
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:13,770
 almost everybody how many people here

318
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,770
 

319
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:18,640
 think they know it my hand is not up

320
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:18,640
 

321
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:22,060
 okay I one of the greatest compliments

322
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:22,060
 

323
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:26,760
 of my career was I one point mark

324
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:26,760
 

325
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:29,380
 Hamburg who was the lead on on Photoshop

326
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,380
 

327
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:32,080
 somebody asked him how he could possibly

328
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:32,080
 

329
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:34,300
 know so much about Photoshop and does he

330
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,300
 

331
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,030
 know everything about Photoshop and he

332
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:37,030
 

333
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:38,740
 said no I'm only able now to hold half a

334
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,740
 

335
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:43,540
 Photoshop in my head but that's okay

336
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:43,540
 

337
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:45,700
 sean has the other half a very

338
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,700
 

339
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:49,690
 compliment you know a great compliment I

340
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:49,690
 

341
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:53,950
 don't think it was ever quite true but

342
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,950
 

343
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:57,010
 that was 20-something years ago right

344
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,010
 

345
00:07:53,950 --> 00:08:00,550
 this application is a beast if you just

346
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,550
 

347
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:02,440
 look at the windows menu I bet a few

348
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,440
 

349
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:04,780
 pallets up those are all the palettes in

350
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,780
 

351
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:08,050
 Photoshop right how many people know

352
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,050
 

353
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:10,180
 that you can edit full 3d models in

354
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,180
 

355
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:13,330
 Photoshop and composite them into your

356
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:13,330
 

357
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:15,250
 world like one person to three people

358
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,250
 

359
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:16,840
 right there's a complete 3d engine

360
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,840
 

361
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,940
 inside of Photoshop if you didn't know

362
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,940
 

363
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:22,990
 how many people knew that you can edit

364
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:22,990
 

365
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:24,820
 video inside of Photoshop yeah one

366
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,820
 

367
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:26,920
 person so there's a complete timeline

368
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,920
 

369
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:29,470
 editor inside a Photoshop so if you want

370
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:29,470
 

371
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:32,260
 to do something like like correct the

372
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,260
 

373
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:35,620
 lens warp of a bunch of panoramic images

374
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,620
 

375
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:37,510
 and stitch them into a video you can do

376
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,510
 

377
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:40,560
 that inside of Photoshop or you can take

378
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,560
 

379
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:43,420
 your 4k video and dump it in and apply

380
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:43,420
 

381
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:46,300
 Gaussian blur inside a Photoshop across

382
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:46,300
 

383
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:50,370
 the set of frames right so there is a

384
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:50,370
 

385
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:53,620
 complete video editor inside Photoshop

386
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,620
 

387
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:55,750
 just things like

388
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,750
 

389
00:08:53,620 --> 00:09:01,180
 the layer effects panel inside a

390
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:01,180
 

391
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:03,520
 Photoshop if I just brought this up this

392
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,520
 

393
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:07,180
 is probably more human interface in this

394
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:07,180
 

395
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:12,880
 one dialog box in most applications have

396
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:12,880
 

397
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:16,180
 in their entire application okay so this

398
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:16,180
 

399
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:23,140
 is a huge application right at at one

400
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:23,140
 

401
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:25,330
 point years ago we had to to send off

402
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,330
 

403
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:27,820
 the strings for translation they had to

404
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,820
 

405
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:29,440
 be redone and the translators came back

406
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,440
 

407
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:33,330
 and said yeah we allocated a couple

408
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:33,330
 

409
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,350
 weeks to go we do this whole whole thing

410
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,350
 

411
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:39,820
 and we said you understand that there

412
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:39,820
 

413
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:42,250
 are 10,000 strings in Photoshop so

414
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:42,250
 

415
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:44,320
 they're like well no we just have to

416
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,320
 

417
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:46,600
 translate the ones that are user visible

418
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,600
 

419
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:52,150
 yeah there's over 10,000 user visible

420
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:52,150
 

421
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:58,960
 strings inside a Photoshop okay so this

422
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:58,960
 

423
00:09:52,150 --> 00:10:01,080
 thing's a beast so one more thing I want

424
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,080
 

425
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:04,840
 to mention before I leave Photoshop yes

426
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:04,840
 

427
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:06,730
 at a top right panel there that's a

428
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,730
 

429
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,860
 system that I worked on in Photoshop

430
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,860
 

431
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:14,470
 called actions and it's a scripting

432
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:14,470
 

433
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:17,500
 system at one point I might still even

434
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,500
 

435
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:22,420
 be true there were more actions for

436
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:22,420
 

437
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:24,810
 Photoshop than there were in any other

438
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:24,810
 

439
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:30,600
 application domain-specific programming

440
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,600
 

441
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:33,070
 language including Visual Basic for word

442
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:33,070
 

443
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:37,000
 that may or may not be true today I

444
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:37,000
 

445
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:39,970
 don't know but it certainly ranks up up

446
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:39,970
 

447
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,820
 there an interesting thing about

448
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,820
 

449
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:44,800
 Photoshop actions is there's no textual

450
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,800
 

451
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,600
 description of them and there's no good

452
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,600
 

453
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,750
 way to actually go in and kind of

454
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:49,750
 

455
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,760
 textually edit them what makes in my

456
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,760
 

457
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:55,500
 opinion Photoshop actions so successful

458
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:55,500
 

459
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:58,540
 is that you can record what you do and

460
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,540
 

461
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:02,380
 they capture not what was actually done

462
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:02,380
 

463
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:04,240
 but what the users intent was so my

464
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,240
 

465
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:06,430
 canonical example for that is if you're

466
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,430
 

467
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:10,839
 resizing an image you go into a comp

468
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,839
 

469
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:12,370
 dialogue you say that you you know you

470
00:11:10,829 --> 00:11:12,370
 

471
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:14,290
 click around on a bunch of fields and

472
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,290
 

473
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:15,820
 you click on ok and what you said in

474
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,820
 

475
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:17,200
 that dialogue box was that you wanted

476
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,200
 

477
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,600
 your document to be 3 inches wide

478
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:19,600
 

479
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,010
 constraining proportions what the

480
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:21,010
 

481
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,040
 application does is it makes your

482
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,040
 

483
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:26,680
 document 500 pixels by 400 pixels

484
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,680
 

485
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:28,810
 well what gets recorded is make your

486
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,810
 

487
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:31,180
 document 3 inches wide constraining

488
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,180
 

489
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:34,060
 proportions right so it has this notion

490
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:34,060
 

491
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:35,589
 of doing smart recording so that you end

492
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,589
 

493
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:38,950
 up with a script that you can playback

494
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:38,950
 

495
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:47,200
 on other documents and it will do what

496
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:47,200
 

497
00:11:38,950 --> 00:12:04,029
 you wanted capturing intensive so let's

498
00:11:47,190 --> 00:12:04,029
 

499
00:11:47,200 --> 00:12:06,010
 go back here when I think about user

500
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:06,010
 

501
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:08,920
 interfaces I try to put things into what

502
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,920
 

503
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:10,870
 I call the taxonomy of everything ok

504
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,870
 

505
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:13,060
 it's a simple way to break down the

506
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,060
 

507
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:15,490
 world take a look at it you've got

508
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,490
 

509
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:19,150
 objects you've got properties of those

510
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,150
 

511
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:24,010
 objects you've got collections of

512
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:24,010
 

513
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:27,970
 objects you've got operations on those

514
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,970
 

515
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:32,680
 objects and you've got relationships

516
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:32,680
 

517
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:34,180
 between objects ok so that's my taxonomy

518
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,180
 

519
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,760
 of everything you can almost describe

520
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,760
 

521
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:45,070
 the entire world describe everything in

522
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:45,070
 

523
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:47,500
 this room in those terms right the

524
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,500
 

525
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:49,750
 classic way to think about building a

526
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,750
 

527
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:53,380
 human interface is this Model View

528
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,380
 

529
00:12:49,750 --> 00:13:01,020
 controller and this definition is one of

530
00:12:53,370 --> 00:13:01,020
 

531
00:12:53,380 --> 00:13:03,430
 the most horribly abused just MVC or

532
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:03,430
 

533
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:06,779
 Model View controller people just

534
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,779
 

535
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:10,060
 redefine it to mean what they want I

536
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:10,060
 

537
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:12,730
 don't do that so this is the definition

538
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:12,730
 

539
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:15,279
 that comes out of design patterns which

540
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,279
 

541
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:19,120
 also comes directly from the original

542
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:19,120
 

543
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:20,230
 work on small talk MVC consists of three

544
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,230
 

545
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,010
 kinds of objects

546
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,010
 

547
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:27,459
 the model is the application object okay

548
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,459
 

549
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:30,130
 the view is its screen presentation like

550
00:13:27,449 --> 00:13:30,130
 

551
00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:32,649
 the view is what you see and the

552
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,649
 

553
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:36,010
 controller defines the way user the user

554
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,010
 

555
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:37,660
 interface reacts to user input okay so

556
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,660
 

557
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:39,310
 the controller in some sense is the

558
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,310
 

559
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:44,889
 keyboard it's the thing that's feeding

560
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:44,889
 

561
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:47,290
 events into this system so the flow of

562
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:47,290
 

563
00:13:44,889 --> 00:13:48,399
 Model View controller some could argue

564
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,399
 

565
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,980
 maybe it should be called controller

566
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:50,980
 

567
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:55,269
 Model View but this is the flow through

568
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:55,269
 

569
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:56,769
 the system right right now this is not

570
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:56,769
 

571
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:58,480
 the definition that you'll find if you

572
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:58,480
 

573
00:13:56,769 --> 00:14:00,850
 look on Apple's website although after

574
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,850
 

575
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,529
 me complaining about this much but so

576
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,529
 

577
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:04,029
 much Apple has actually changed their

578
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:04,029
 

579
00:14:02,529 --> 00:14:05,860
 website so let us get a little footnote

580
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:05,860
 

581
00:14:04,029 --> 00:14:07,899
 that says this is not classic Model View

582
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,899
 

583
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:11,260
 controller this is the definition of a

584
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:11,260
 

585
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:13,120
 we call Model View controller you know

586
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,120
 

587
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,920
 you'll hear Microsoft say we have model

588
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,920
 

589
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,529
 view viewmodel and there's no controller

590
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,529
 

591
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,029
 in there whatsoever and that's abuse in

592
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,029
 

593
00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:20,199
 my opinion you're taking the same terms

594
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:20,199
 

595
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:22,510
 and you're redefining them these are

596
00:14:20,189 --> 00:14:22,510
 

597
00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:27,220
 well established terms and this is

598
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:27,220
 

599
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:30,120
 actually a very solid pattern so how did

600
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:30,120
 

601
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:30,120
 it get so screwed up

602
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:30,630
 

603
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:39,010
 I had a hypothesis several years ago

604
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:39,010
 

605
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:41,130
 that where a Model View controller got

606
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,130
 

607
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:45,100
 so screwed up was actually with the Lisa

608
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,100
 

609
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:47,320
 right Lisa was created by the folks at

610
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:47,320
 

611
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:50,110
 Xerox PARC who worked on small talk--

612
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:50,110
 

613
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:53,260
 who understood model view controller and

614
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,260
 

615
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:56,079
 they went out and they created Lisa and

616
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,079
 

617
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:58,420
 Lisa does not follow a classic model

618
00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:58,420
 

619
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,640
 view controller pattern and everybody

620
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,640
 

621
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:02,560
 after the Lisa the Mac team the windows

622
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,560
 

623
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:07,990
 team has copied what was done on the

624
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:07,990
 

625
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:09,390
 Lisa team so I went to a member of the

626
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,390
 

627
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:14,890
 original Lisa team

628
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:14,890
 

629
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:17,620
 Rudy sherry and I asked him I said

630
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,620
 

631
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:19,449
 here's my hypothesis you guys understood

632
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:19,449
 

633
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:21,160
 what model view controller was but you

634
00:15:19,439 --> 00:15:21,160
 

635
00:15:19,449 --> 00:15:23,290
 weren't working in small talk anymore

636
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:23,290
 

637
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:27,279
 you were working in Pascal or object

638
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:27,279
 

639
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:30,010
 pascal and so you had huge difficulty

640
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:30,010
 

641
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:33,970
 writing an observer you couldn't observe

642
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,970
 

643
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:36,699
 your model okay so you lifted

644
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,699
 

645
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:37,930
 to the model into the UI and they said

646
00:15:36,689 --> 00:15:37,930
 

647
00:15:36,699 --> 00:15:39,610
 yo oh yeah exactly

648
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,610
 

649
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:43,569
 we cut a whole bunch of corners in

650
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,569
 

651
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:45,009
 building it right right so here's a case

652
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:45,009
 

653
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:47,220
 in history where you had people who

654
00:15:44,999 --> 00:15:47,220
 

655
00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:50,889
 understood the correct way to do things

656
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:50,889
 

657
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:53,290
 okay who cut a bunch of corners and then

658
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:53,290
 

659
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:55,389
 for the next 30 years it'll probably be

660
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,389
 

661
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:58,779
 30 plus years soon the rest of the

662
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:58,779
 

663
00:15:55,389 --> 00:16:01,600
 industry has copied those mistakes and

664
00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:01,600
 

665
00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:03,160
 been confused by those mistakes right so

666
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,160
 

667
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,800
 I kind of encourage you all if you're

668
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,800
 

669
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,540
 interested in user interfaces go back to

670
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,540
 

671
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,670
 some of the original small talk work to

672
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,670
 

673
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:15,009
 go back to the old small talk book and

674
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:15,009
 

675
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:17,199
 read about how it was done then I wrote

676
00:16:14,999 --> 00:16:17,199
 

677
00:16:15,009 --> 00:16:18,879
 a whole little blog post there's the

678
00:16:17,189 --> 00:16:18,879
 

679
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:21,399
 link for it you can find almost

680
00:16:18,869 --> 00:16:21,399
 

681
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:25,629
 everything I there off the esti lab CC

682
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:25,629
 

683
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:27,250
 website or Shawn - parent /st lab these

684
00:16:25,619 --> 00:16:27,250
 

685
00:16:25,629 --> 00:16:29,189
 slides will be available for you later

686
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,189
 

687
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:33,300
 so you don't have to copy that down

688
00:16:29,179 --> 00:16:33,300
 

689
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:33,300
 about kind of a history of MVC

690
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:34,970
 

691
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:40,750
 so in order to build a UI we need to

692
00:16:38,429 --> 00:16:40,750
 

693
00:16:38,439 --> 00:16:42,970
 build an observable model write the

694
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,970
 

695
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:44,649
 model is the application object and a

696
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,649
 

697
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:47,350
 lot of people think the model is just

698
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,350
 

699
00:16:44,649 --> 00:16:47,949
 being the data right but it's not just

700
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:47,949
 

701
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:50,399
 the data

702
00:16:47,939 --> 00:16:50,399
 

703
00:16:47,949 --> 00:16:52,600
 it's the objects it's the operations

704
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:52,600
 

705
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,519
 okay that you can perform on those

706
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,519
 

707
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:57,160
 objects and it's the relationship

708
00:16:54,509 --> 00:16:57,160
 

709
00:16:54,519 --> 00:17:00,100
 between those objects and you have to

710
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:00,100
 

711
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:04,050
 take that whole collection of things and

712
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:04,050
 

713
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:04,050
 make it observable to the user so

714
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:04,279
 

715
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:09,220
 controllers end up binding to our

716
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:09,220
 

717
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:13,500
 operations a trivial controller is

718
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:13,500
 

719
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:15,850
 something that just sets a property okay

720
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,850
 

721
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:20,409
 view is buying two objects and their

722
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:20,409
 

723
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:23,679
 properties in order to display them so a

724
00:17:20,399 --> 00:17:23,679
 

725
00:17:20,409 --> 00:17:27,819
 view controller right unlike what Apple

726
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:27,819
 

727
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:29,500
 will tell you a view controller is is a

728
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:29,500
 

729
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:32,320
 controller widget something like a

730
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:32,320
 

731
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:34,539
 checkbox it's a combination of the

732
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,539
 

733
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,880
 controller it's going to issue a vent to

734
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:36,880
 

735
00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:39,429
 your model and a view and that it's

736
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:39,429
 

737
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,440
 displaying okay it's gonna have a little

738
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:41,440
 

739
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:43,030
 logic in there so that it can interpret

740
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,030
 

741
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,610
 so that the controller side can

742
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,610
 

743
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:48,750
 interpret events based off what it's

744
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,750
 

745
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:48,750
 displaying from the view

746
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:50,700
 

747
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:56,870
 okay so objects objects have a set of

748
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,870
 

749
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:58,550
 operations right and they should look

750
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,550
 

751
00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:00,920
 very familiar these are the operations

752
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,920
 

753
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:04,250
 you would kind of have on a regular type

754
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:04,250
 

755
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:06,050
 right you have some way to construct it

756
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,050
 

757
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:08,260
 you're gonna have a copy constructive

758
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,260
 

759
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:11,540
 some some sort some way to make a copy

760
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,540
 

761
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:13,900
 objects exist within a space they have a

762
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,900
 

763
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:17,530
 location therefore I can move an object

764
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:17,530
 

765
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:22,010
 okay I can delete or destruct an object

766
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:22,010
 

767
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:24,410
 objects have properties all objects have

768
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,410
 

769
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:27,500
 a location they have to exist in a space

770
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,500
 

771
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:32,540
 they have a size they consume some

772
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:32,540
 

773
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:36,880
 amount of space and commonly they have a

774
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:36,880
 

775
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:42,580
 name okay we can call them something

776
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:42,580
 

777
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:45,050
 like you see this surfaced inside of

778
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:45,050
 

779
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:47,810
 applications right in the terminology

780
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,810
 

781
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:49,550
 that we use we're going to construct a

782
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,550
 

783
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:51,830
 new layer how do we do that we do that

784
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,830
 

785
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:55,670
 with new which is a very programming

786
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:55,670
 

787
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:57,860
 term okay I want to create a new layer

788
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,860
 

789
00:18:55,670 --> 00:19:00,670
 or a new background from a layer or a

790
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:00,670
 

791
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:09,770
 new group or a new group from layers

792
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:09,770
 

793
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:11,690
 right we associate Vigil visual

794
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,690
 

795
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:14,960
 constructs like names icons and

796
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,960
 

797
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:17,720
 behaviors with semantics right human

798
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:17,720
 

799
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:21,710
 interface is a language it is a way to

800
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:21,710
 

801
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:24,860
 communicate with the user in program

802
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,860
 

803
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:28,070
 operations like construct have specific

804
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:28,070
 

805
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:29,990
 command semantics in the H I we

806
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,990
 

807
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:36,140
 associate those semantics with

808
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:36,140
 

809
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:41,720
 particular controls this is an old

810
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:41,720
 

811
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:47,120
 screenshot of Gmail so why am I putting

812
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:47,120
 

813
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:49,640
 this up here well in 2009 I left Adobe

814
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:49,640
 

815
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,830
 and I went to work at Google for about a

816
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,830
 

817
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,420
 year and this was the closest to a

818
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,420
 

819
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:55,550
 screenshot that I could find for what

820
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:55,550
 

821
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:59,170
 Gmail looked like at that time this

822
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:59,170
 

823
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:59,170
 actually goes back a little older

824
00:19:59,510 --> 00:19:59,510
 

825
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,090
 but I didn't save a screen shot at that

826
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,090
 

827
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:04,530
 time so I had to hunt down something

828
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,530
 

829
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:09,059
 that looked the same on the web so I

830
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:09,059
 

831
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:11,940
 stole this from the internet so I'm

832
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:11,940
 

833
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:14,520
 relatively new at Google I've got a

834
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:14,520
 

835
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:17,039
 meeting with members of the Google

836
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,039
 

837
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,720
 executive staff and it's an important

838
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:18,720
 

839
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,520
 meeting the kind of meeting where if you

840
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,520
 

841
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,100
 don't show up to the meeting you should

842
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,100
 

843
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,200
 probably just turn in your badge and go

844
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,200
 

845
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:27,299
 home

846
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:27,299
 

847
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:29,669
 and I get a phone call for a family

848
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:29,669
 

849
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:34,049
 emergency and it's the kind of family

850
00:20:29,659 --> 00:20:34,049
 

851
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:36,240
 emergency where your heart stops and I

852
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:36,240
 

853
00:20:34,049 --> 00:20:41,039
 have to go to address this family

854
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:41,039
 

855
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:43,980
 emergency so before I leave I want to

856
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:43,980
 

857
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:47,600
 send off a very quick email to just say

858
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:47,600
 

859
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:51,270
 I will not make this meeting okay

860
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:51,270
 

861
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:55,320
 just one line send it to my boss I will

862
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:55,320
 

863
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:59,970
 not meeting and I pulled Qi mail and I'm

864
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:59,970
 

865
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:06,120
 in a total utter panic and I say how did

866
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:06,120
 

867
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:08,520
 I create a new email okay wasn't the

868
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:08,520
 

869
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:13,460
 first time I used Gmail I had been using

870
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:13,460
 

871
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:18,929
 it for a while okay and I pull this up

872
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:18,929
 

873
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:22,530
 and I look new new where's new I don't

874
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:22,530
 

875
00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:24,270
 see new ok well new as an action an

876
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,270
 

877
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:28,860
 action is a button where is the button

878
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:28,860
 

879
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:31,860
 to create a new email right there isn't

880
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:31,860
 

881
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:34,289
 one and the clock in my head at least is

882
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:34,289
 

883
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:38,210
 ticking you know probably seemed like 20

884
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:38,210
 

885
00:21:34,289 --> 00:21:41,549
 minutes it was probably just 30 seconds

886
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,549
 

887
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:48,980
 but I was in a panic how in the eff do I

888
00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:48,980
 

889
00:21:41,549 --> 00:21:52,110
 create a new email okay I can't find it

890
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:52,110
 

891
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:53,700
 why can't I find it all right everybody

892
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,700
 

893
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:58,320
 sees it here right

894
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:58,320
 

895
00:21:53,700 --> 00:22:01,740
 there's compose mail but it's a link one

896
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:01,740
 

897
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:06,480
 of the semantics of a link takes you

898
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:06,480
 

899
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:10,680
 somewhere else construction is not a

900
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:10,680
 

901
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:17,100
 place okay

902
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:17,100
 

903
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:17,730
 it's not so in a planning I couldn't

904
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:17,730
 

905
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:21,830
 find it

906
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,830
 

907
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:25,350
 I could not decode this UI right

908
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:25,350
 

909
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:27,270
 eventually I was like oh there it is

910
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,270
 

911
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:29,100
 and then I'm cursing at my machine and I

912
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,100
 

913
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:31,140
 send off my email and I go off and I

914
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:31,140
 

915
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,850
 resolve my family emergency and they

916
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:32,850
 

917
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:36,060
 come back in and I'm not fired and I'm

918
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,060
 

919
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:40,530
 thankful for that and I send off a

920
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:40,530
 

921
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:45,330
 flaming email right right how can

922
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:45,330
 

923
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:49,020
 anybody create this UI so this is what

924
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:49,020
 

925
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:52,230
 Gmail looks like now it's a button that

926
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:52,230
 

927
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:56,480
 says compose I don't know if it's a red

928
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:56,480
 

929
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:56,480
 because of me but it's been red ever sad

930
00:22:58,330 --> 00:22:58,330
 

931
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:08,160
 okay that matters right a button is an

932
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:08,160
 

933
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:10,140
 action a button does something I still

934
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,140
 

935
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:12,810
 think it should same like new email they

936
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:12,810
 

937
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:21,440
 are not just compose but at least it's

938
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:21,440
 

939
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:26,460
 not a link anymore okay it is better so

940
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:26,460
 

941
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:28,950
 semantic smash so collections right if

942
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:28,950
 

943
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:30,600
 we have a collection of objects we have

944
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,600
 

945
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:32,760
 a set of operations on that collection

946
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,760
 

947
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,380
 right we can insert items in the

948
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,380
 

949
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:36,450
 collection we can remove things from the

950
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:36,450
 

951
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:39,360
 collection there's a count of items

952
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,360
 

953
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:41,250
 within the collection right and there's

954
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,250
 

955
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,840
 a whole part relationship between the

956
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,840
 

957
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:46,970
 objects that are in the collection and

958
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:46,970
 

959
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,970
 the collection itself okay

960
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:48,610
 

961
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:55,680
 so large collections pose a problem

962
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,680
 

963
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:58,290
 right how do you observe a large

964
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:58,290
 

965
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:00,600
 collection interact to interactively and

966
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,600
 

967
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:04,350
 allow the user to arrange and filter and

968
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:04,350
 

969
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:06,660
 browse a large collection right this is

970
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,660
 

971
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:09,120
 a very common problem in building human

972
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:09,120
 

973
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:12,690
 interfaces right this is largely the

974
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:12,690
 

975
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:14,880
 problem of search right you go to Google

976
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,880
 

977
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:17,520
 and you search for things and there's an

978
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,520
 

979
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:20,010
 infinite number of results and they have

980
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:20,010
 

981
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:22,800
 to figure out how do we display them to

982
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,800
 

983
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:24,240
 you in a meaningful way okay with the

984
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,240
 

985
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,950
 things on top and

986
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,950
 

987
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,540
 let you browse through them so they've

988
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,540
 

989
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:37,190
 kind of done that with a paging

990
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:37,190
 

991
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:40,230
 interface look through pages okay so I

992
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:40,230
 

993
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:42,780
 like to give out some practical advice

994
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,780
 

995
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:44,550
 here right so if you're faced with a

996
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:44,550
 

997
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:46,470
 large collection of things a very common

998
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,470
 

999
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:49,860
 thing that you're going to want to do is

1000
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:49,860
 

1001
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:52,710
 to be able to give the user a window

1002
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:52,710
 

1003
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:55,530
 into that collection okay and let them

1004
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,530
 

1005
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:57,120
 operate just within that window and you

1006
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,120
 

1007
00:24:55,530 --> 00:25:00,500
 can do that more efficiently than you

1008
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:00,500
 

1009
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:04,110
 can within the collection as a whole

1010
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:04,110
 

1011
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:06,240
 okay and oftentimes I see user

1012
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,240
 

1013
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:08,010
 interfaces that don't scale and get very

1014
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,010
 

1015
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,590
 slow when you have a large collection

1016
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,590
 

1017
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:12,929
 who's ever had an application where it's

1018
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,929
 

1019
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:15,120
 like oh well it worked well with with 10

1020
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:15,120
 

1021
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:17,040
 items or 20 items but you put a thousand

1022
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:17,040
 

1023
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:22,650
 items in there and the user interface

1024
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:22,650
 

1025
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:24,150
 just slugs along right okay so a very

1026
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,150
 

1027
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:26,520
 common thing that you might want to do

1028
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,520
 

1029
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:30,210
 is show the user arrange within a

1030
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:30,210
 

1031
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:32,190
 collection that's sorted right so our

1032
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,190
 

1033
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:40,440
 challenge here is we want to sort

1034
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:40,440
 

1035
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:43,140
 everything from SF to SLE okay so how

1036
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:43,140
 

1037
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:46,440
 many people now know they're STL

1038
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:46,440
 

1039
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:53,550
 algorithms okay how am I going to do

1040
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:53,550
 

1041
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:57,330
 that where do I start n element and I

1042
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:57,330
 

1043
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:59,429
 heard a partial sort okay so partial

1044
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,429
 

1045
00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:03,300
 sort is part of the answer but it won't

1046
00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:03,300
 

1047
00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:06,270
 give us this n element is where we're

1048
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:06,270
 

1049
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:07,850
 gonna start okay so what we want to do

1050
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,850
 

1051
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:10,650
 is we want to sort in the middle there

1052
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,650
 

1053
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:12,000
 okay as if the entire range were sorted

1054
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,000
 

1055
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:20,220
 but we don't care about everything above

1056
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:20,220
 

1057
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:22,710
 and below what's that and then sort in

1058
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:22,710
 

1059
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:24,050
 between let's see what we can do here

1060
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,050
 

1061
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:25,960
 okay

1062
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,960
 

1063
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:27,940
 so

1064
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,940
 

1065
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:30,159
 what we want to do is we're gonna start

1066
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:30,159
 

1067
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:33,730
 with in element and we're gonna pin our

1068
00:26:30,149 --> 00:26:33,730
 

1069
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:37,740
 first guy right

1070
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,740
 

1071
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:40,419
 that will get six into the right place

1072
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:40,419
 

1073
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:43,480
 just looking at the data there that's a

1074
00:26:40,409 --> 00:26:43,480
 

1075
00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:47,279
 little grayed out nth element did

1076
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:47,279
 

1077
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:51,880
 something else anybody know what it did

1078
00:26:47,269 --> 00:26:51,880
 

1079
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:54,309
 it partitioned the set its are way

1080
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:54,309
 

1081
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:59,850
 better than you were a few years ago pay

1082
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:59,850
 

1083
00:26:54,309 --> 00:26:59,850
 attention here okay a partition the set

1084
00:27:00,649 --> 00:27:00,649
 

1085
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:07,960
 so that means that everything up there

1086
00:27:03,149 --> 00:27:07,960
 

1087
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:11,970
 is less than or equal to and everything

1088
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:11,970
 

1089
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,970
 down there is greater than or equal to

1090
00:27:12,769 --> 00:27:12,769
 

1091
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:20,970
 right so now we still need to get those

1092
00:27:17,909 --> 00:27:20,970
 

1093
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:26,980
 guys okay

1094
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,980
 

1095
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:28,179
 so partial sort right so partial sort so

1096
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:28,179
 

1097
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:29,950
 we don't care about that guy so we get

1098
00:27:28,169 --> 00:27:29,950
 

1099
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:32,890
 to skip over him now right he's already

1100
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,890
 

1101
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:35,890
 in the right place and now we can call

1102
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,890
 

1103
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:39,130
 partial sort for the remaining elements

1104
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,130
 

1105
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:40,899
 and that will give us that right partial

1106
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,899
 

1107
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:43,029
 sort does what we want but only at the

1108
00:27:40,889 --> 00:27:43,029
 

1109
00:27:40,899 --> 00:27:46,029
 start of a range because nth element

1110
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:46,029
 

1111
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:48,039
 left our range partitioned okay

1112
00:27:46,019 --> 00:27:48,039
 

1113
00:27:46,029 --> 00:27:51,600
 we know that we can just now do a

1114
00:27:48,029 --> 00:27:51,600
 

1115
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:51,600
 partial sort on the remaining pieces

1116
00:27:52,789 --> 00:27:52,789
 

1117
00:27:52,799 --> 00:28:02,860
 okay so now if our two boundaries are

1118
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:02,860
 

1119
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:04,600
 equal then we're just going to return we

1120
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,600
 

1121
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:05,919
 don't have to do an element if we're

1122
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:05,919
 

1123
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:09,250
 right at the start of the range we can

1124
00:28:05,909 --> 00:28:09,250
 

1125
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,809
 just do partial sort and now we got a

1126
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,809
 

1127
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:12,640
 handy little algorithm sorts up range

1128
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,640
 

1129
00:28:10,809 --> 00:28:22,299
 Marshall can go stick this in the

1130
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:22,299
 

1131
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:25,270
 standard now okay very handy okay sub

1132
00:28:22,289 --> 00:28:25,270
 

1133
00:28:22,299 --> 00:28:27,309
 range was exactly what we want right and

1134
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,309
 

1135
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:29,230
 then practice this will usually be an

1136
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:29,230
 

1137
00:28:27,309 --> 00:28:32,529
 order of magnitude or so faster than

1138
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:32,529
 

1139
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:34,059
 sorting the entire sequence right if

1140
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:34,059
 

1141
00:28:32,529 --> 00:28:37,659
 you're doing graphics work and you do

1142
00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:37,659
 

1143
00:28:34,059 --> 00:28:40,040
 need to do things like take a median but

1144
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:40,040
 

1145
00:28:37,659 --> 00:28:42,330
 where you want a windowed media

1146
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:42,330
 

1147
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,950
 around things this is also a good

1148
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,950
 

1149
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:46,230
 technique for calculating things like

1150
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:46,230
 

1151
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:48,150
 that okay faster than sorting your

1152
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,150
 

1153
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:51,810
 entire range and slicing out the data if

1154
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:51,810
 

1155
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:53,640
 you want out of the middle right and if

1156
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,640
 

1157
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:55,860
 you want to grow this window because the

1158
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:55,860
 

1159
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:58,170
 user Scrolls down you can just do

1160
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:58,170
 

1161
00:28:55,860 --> 00:29:01,140
 additional partial sorts right because

1162
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:01,140
 

1163
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:10,800
 our data is still partitioned so we can

1164
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:10,800
 

1165
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:13,230
 still leverage that okay so operations

1166
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,230
 

1167
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:15,420
 act on one or more objects additional

1168
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,420
 

1169
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:19,680
 lock operations to the arguments are

1170
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:19,680
 

1171
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:21,690
 bound as as to the operation as

1172
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:21,690
 

1173
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:24,060
 properties what do I mean by that if you

1174
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,060
 

1175
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:26,250
 go into a user interface typically what

1176
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:26,250
 

1177
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:28,680
 you'll see is you pull up some dialog

1178
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,680
 

1179
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:30,810
 right right Laurie give you a visual

1180
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,810
 

1181
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:33,180
 interface you construct things so what

1182
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,180
 

1183
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:36,000
 you're doing there within the dialog is

1184
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:36,000
 

1185
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:37,830
 you are our setting a set of properties

1186
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:37,830
 

1187
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,170
 but usually those are not properties

1188
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:40,170
 

1189
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:42,420
 directly on the document those are the

1190
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,420
 

1191
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:44,730
 arguments to the command that you're

1192
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:44,730
 

1193
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:45,990
 going to issue right and it doesn't

1194
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,990
 

1195
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:48,510
 matter if you go in and you're dragging

1196
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,510
 

1197
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:50,280
 about handles or things like that what

1198
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,280
 

1199
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:53,430
 you're doing is you're constructing a

1200
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:53,430
 

1201
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:55,920
 command which are then going to issue to

1202
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,920
 

1203
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:58,200
 the application okay

1204
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:58,200
 

1205
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:01,500
 operations are represented by buttons

1206
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:01,500
 

1207
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:05,400
 menu items gestures tools write or

1208
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:05,400
 

1209
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:07,320
 direct manipulation subject or target of

1210
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,320
 

1211
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:09,750
 an operation is identified by a

1212
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:09,750
 

1213
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:12,000
 selection right or by direct

1214
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:12,000
 

1215
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:13,590
 manipulation right I can go and select a

1216
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,590
 

1217
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,620
 bunch of guys or I can just go in and

1218
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,620
 

1219
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:19,070
 pick one guy and do something with it

1220
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:19,070
 

1221
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:24,030
 common metaphors and human interface

1222
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:24,030
 

1223
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:27,210
 okay so selections selecting objects

1224
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:27,210
 

1225
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:32,310
 within a hierarchy specifies one or more

1226
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:32,310
 

1227
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:33,780
 as target paths right so you typically

1228
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,780
 

1229
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:35,250
 build a hierarchy within your

1230
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:35,250
 

1231
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:36,960
 application so you have application

1232
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,960
 

1233
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:39,510
 which contains documents which contains

1234
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:39,510
 

1235
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,990
 objects within those objects they

1236
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,990
 

1237
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:46,110
 contain other other objects and going

1238
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:46,110
 

1239
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:50,220
 back to the original Macintosh and even

1240
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:50,220
 

1241
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:51,980
 before that the Lisa that got surfaced

1242
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:51,980
 

1243
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:54,590
 up into the menu right

1244
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:54,590
 

1245
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:58,549
 so if you look here on the left side we

1246
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:58,549
 

1247
00:30:54,590 --> 00:31:01,460
 have have Apple what does that represent

1248
00:30:58,539 --> 00:31:01,460
 

1249
00:30:58,549 --> 00:31:05,120
 it represents things that you can do to

1250
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:05,120
 

1251
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:07,100
 the machine as a whole okay and then the

1252
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:07,100
 

1253
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:10,039
 Photoshop menu these are things that

1254
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:10,039
 

1255
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:13,309
 apply to the application as a whole and

1256
00:31:10,029 --> 00:31:13,309
 

1257
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:16,549
 the file menu things that apply to the

1258
00:31:13,299 --> 00:31:16,549
 

1259
00:31:13,309 --> 00:31:19,220
 document as a whole okay

1260
00:31:16,539 --> 00:31:19,220
 

1261
00:31:16,549 --> 00:31:22,370
 and the Edit menu things that apply to

1262
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:22,370
 

1263
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:26,419
 the currently selected object within

1264
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:26,419
 

1265
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:28,549
 that document so if you think about it

1266
00:31:26,409 --> 00:31:28,549
 

1267
00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:32,059
 that currently selected object within

1268
00:31:28,539 --> 00:31:32,059
 

1269
00:31:28,549 --> 00:31:34,549
 the document is a leaf node within that

1270
00:31:32,049 --> 00:31:34,549
 

1271
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:36,860
 hierarchy that you can trace back to the

1272
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:36,860
 

1273
00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:39,200
 root what document are we talking about

1274
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:39,200
 

1275
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:42,980
 the document that contains the currently

1276
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:42,980
 

1277
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,789
 selected object right not any documents

1278
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:43,789
 

1279
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:47,480
 we're talking about a particular

1280
00:31:43,779 --> 00:31:47,480
 

1281
00:31:43,789 --> 00:31:51,620
 document right within the currently

1282
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:51,620
 

1283
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:58,159
 selected application on the current

1284
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:58,159
 

1285
00:31:51,620 --> 00:32:00,350
 machine right so that creates a path so

1286
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:00,350
 

1287
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:07,070
 interval sets boost has a library called

1288
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:07,070
 

1289
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:08,720
 interval sets the boost structure is a

1290
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,720
 

1291
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:10,730
 little complicated I prefer just

1292
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:10,730
 

1293
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:16,309
 encoding interval sets directly within a

1294
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:16,309
 

1295
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:19,580
 vector but nevertheless an interval set

1296
00:32:16,299 --> 00:32:19,580
 

1297
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:25,840
 is a good data structure to represent a

1298
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:25,840
 

1299
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:28,610
 selection right it'll let me represent a

1300
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:28,610
 

1301
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:30,380
 disjoint collection of objects quite

1302
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,380
 

1303
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:32,480
 efficiently you can even create

1304
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:32,480
 

1305
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:35,090
 two-dimensional interval sets for

1306
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:35,090
 

1307
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:38,210
 anybody who did early work on a

1308
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:38,210
 

1309
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:42,490
 Macintosh a quick-draw region is an

1310
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:42,490
 

1311
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:52,399
 example of a 2-dimensional interval set

1312
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:52,399
 

1313
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:54,740
 okay so in my c++ seasoning talk in the

1314
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:54,740
 

1315
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:57,679
 Norra loop section I presented this

1316
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:57,679
 

1317
00:32:54,740 --> 00:33:01,690
 algorithm the gather algorithm like

1318
00:32:57,669 --> 00:33:01,690
 

1319
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,690
 marshal cloud gets credit for the name

1320
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:02,540
 

1321
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:05,850
 okay and that's what you're doing you're

1322
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,850
 

1323
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:08,160
 taking this collection of disjoint

1324
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,160
 

1325
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:09,870
 selected things and you're dragging them

1326
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:09,870
 

1327
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,760
 to a particular location within your

1328
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,760
 

1329
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:14,370
 collection how many people have seen

1330
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:14,370
 

1331
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:17,400
 that talk you know everybody it's a

1332
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,400
 

1333
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:19,170
 popular talk so it's done well I'm gonna

1334
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:19,170
 

1335
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:22,350
 cruise through this kind of fast right

1336
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,350
 

1337
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:24,540
 the way that this breaks down is as to

1338
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,540
 

1339
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:26,420
 calls to stable partitions so we can do

1340
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:26,420
 

1341
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:29,250
 a stable partition on the lower half and

1342
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:29,250
 

1343
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:31,130
 we can invert our predicate and we can

1344
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,130
 

1345
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:35,100
 do stable partition on the upper half

1346
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,100
 

1347
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:38,670
 okay and that gives us the gather

1348
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:38,670
 

1349
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:40,710
 function okay so next time you're

1350
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,710
 

1351
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:42,750
 frustrated in an application because you

1352
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,750
 

1353
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:45,030
 can't create a disjoint selection and

1354
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45,030
 

1355
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:47,100
 drag things to one place you can point

1356
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,100
 

1357
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:49,380
 them to my taco Z please go watch on

1358
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:49,380
 

1359
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:57,240
 stock and fix your application so it

1360
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:57,240
 

1361
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:59,400
 drives me nuts so that's that but I

1362
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:59,400
 

1363
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:02,160
 don't want to talk directly about that

1364
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:02,160
 

1365
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:03,570
 right it also returns the two points but

1366
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:03,570
 

1367
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:07,590
 I really want to talk about is stable

1368
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:07,590
 

1369
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:11,850
 partition okay why do I want to talk

1370
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:11,850
 

1371
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:13,320
 about stable partition so that's table

1372
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,320
 

1373
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:18,090
 partition who here knows how to write

1374
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:18,090
 

1375
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:22,250
 stable partition anybody ah you get to

1376
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:22,250
 

1377
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:26,820
 learn how to write stable partition okay

1378
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,820
 

1379
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:29,580
 so so for most algorithms they fall into

1380
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:29,580
 

1381
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:31,380
 one or two categories right for most

1382
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:31,380
 

1383
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:32,820
 algorithms you can either say okay I'm

1384
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:32,820
 

1385
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:35,940
 going to start at the beginning of my

1386
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:35,940
 

1387
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:37,950
 sequence and I'm going to assume that

1388
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:37,950
 

1389
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:39,929
 now I met some point and and that

1390
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,929
 

1391
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:41,070
 everything behind me magically satisfies

1392
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:41,070
 

1393
00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:43,050
 whatever I'm trying to do with the

1394
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,050
 

1395
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:44,940
 algorithm and so now I figured need to

1396
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,940
 

1397
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:47,100
 figure out how do I make the next guy

1398
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:47,100
 

1399
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:50,280
 satisfy that linearly go through my

1400
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:50,280
 

1401
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:52,200
 sequence and do that the other common

1402
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:52,200
 

1403
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:54,690
 thing is to say well what if I could

1404
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,690
 

1405
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:57,930
 just jump to the middle everything to my

1406
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,930
 

1407
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:59,280
 left satisfied my algorithm and

1408
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,280
 

1409
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:01,170
 everything to the right satisfied my

1410
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:01,170
 

1411
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,360
 algorithm and now I just need a way to

1412
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,360
 

1413
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:06,000
 merge those two things so that the whole

1414
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:06,000
 

1415
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:08,130
 thing satisfies the algorithm okay those

1416
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:08,130
 

1417
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,430
 are the two most common approaches to

1418
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:11,430
 

1419
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:12,840
 satisfying an algorithm job so what

1420
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,840
 

1421
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:15,000
 we're gonna do here is we're gonna say

1422
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:15,000
 

1423
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:17,369
 well imagine that we could just cut this

1424
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:17,369
 

1425
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:21,580
 thing in half

1426
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:21,580
 

1427
00:35:17,369 --> 00:35:23,349
 okay and that the top has formed a

1428
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:23,349
 

1429
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:26,710
 stable partition and the bottom half

1430
00:35:23,339 --> 00:35:26,710
 

1431
00:35:23,349 --> 00:35:28,180
 formed is the other partition how would

1432
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,180
 

1433
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:34,270
 we do that well we would call stable

1434
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:34,270
 

1435
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:37,599
 partition on both halves okay then the

1436
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:37,599
 

1437
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:39,970
 problem becomes how do I put those

1438
00:35:37,589 --> 00:35:39,970
 

1439
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:42,099
 pieces in the right order right right

1440
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,099
 

1441
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:44,080
 between the top arrow and the bottom

1442
00:35:42,089 --> 00:35:44,080
 

1443
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:47,130
 arrow in my midpoint those are the

1444
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:47,130
 

1445
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:52,150
 pieces that are in the wrong order right

1446
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:52,150
 

1447
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:56,470
 who sees what do I call here one person

1448
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:56,470
 

1449
00:35:52,150 --> 00:36:02,080
 I have to say it that's obviously a

1450
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:02,080
 

1451
00:35:56,470 --> 00:36:08,440
 rotate so we're gonna call rotate put

1452
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:08,440
 

1453
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:10,859
 those pieces together okay rotate is

1454
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:10,859
 

1455
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:14,320
 going to return our partition point

1456
00:36:10,849 --> 00:36:14,320
 

1457
00:36:10,859 --> 00:36:19,210
 which is our new middle so we can return

1458
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:19,210
 

1459
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:23,380
 that so now all we need is our inductive

1460
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,380
 

1461
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:30,570
 base okay so when we get down to just a

1462
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:30,570
 

1463
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:30,570
 one element window okay if it's selected

1464
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:30,680
 

1465
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:36,900
 what's the answer what do we return for

1466
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,900
 

1467
00:36:33,609 --> 00:36:41,440
 a stable partition of the selected guy

1468
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:41,440
 

1469
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:43,869
 right okay if it's selected we're gonna

1470
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:43,869
 

1471
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,460
 return right after it if it's not

1472
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:45,460
 

1473
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:47,830
 selected we're just gonna return where

1474
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:47,830
 

1475
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:50,109
 it is okay so the are there is our

1476
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,109
 

1477
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:51,460
 result if it's not selected we return

1478
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:51,460
 

1479
00:36:50,109 --> 00:36:55,690
 the element we're looking at if it is

1480
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:55,690
 

1481
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:59,140
 selected we return one after it so

1482
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,140
 

1483
00:36:55,690 --> 00:37:02,859
 that's our inductive base so now we just

1484
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:02,859
 

1485
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:05,800
 need to fill out handling n so that we

1486
00:37:02,849 --> 00:37:05,800
 

1487
00:37:02,859 --> 00:37:07,150
 can calculate our midpoints and we need

1488
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,150
 

1489
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,530
 to make sure that we handle the zero

1490
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,530
 

1491
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:10,359
 case where things are completely empty

1492
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,359
 

1493
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:13,869
 in which case the result is just

1494
00:37:10,349 --> 00:37:13,869
 

1495
00:37:10,359 --> 00:37:16,450
 returning first and that's an

1496
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:16,450
 

1497
00:37:13,869 --> 00:37:18,730
 implementation of stable partition why

1498
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,730
 

1499
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:20,980
 am i showing this to you there's

1500
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,980
 

1501
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:23,520
 something amazing I think in this

1502
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:23,520
 

1503
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:23,520
 algorithm

1504
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:26,010
 

1505
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:34,310
 right there what's amazing about that

1506
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,310
 

1507
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:39,260
 every time I look at this piece of code

1508
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:39,260
 

1509
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:41,120
 I'm just like that is so beautiful the

1510
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,120
 

1511
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:44,150
 predicate is called only once per

1512
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:44,150
 

1513
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:47,900
 element and it's called on that element

1514
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:47,900
 

1515
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:50,180
 before that element has moved okay think

1516
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:50,180
 

1517
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:51,860
 about it we're going to do a stable

1518
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:51,860
 

1519
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:54,650
 partition on a bunch of selected guys

1520
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:54,650
 

1521
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:56,720
 we're gonna recurse all the way down to

1522
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,720
 

1523
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:58,370
 the leaf nodes we're gonna ask the

1524
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:58,370
 

1525
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,770
 element exactly one time are you

1526
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,770
 

1527
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:02,450
 selected or not selected and then we're

1528
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,450
 

1529
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:06,710
 gonna put everything in the right place

1530
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,710
 

1531
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:11,600
 back up the tree okay so there are only

1532
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:11,600
 

1533
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:15,530
 n calls to P and all of those calls

1534
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:15,530
 

1535
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:20,450
 happened before P was before the item at

1536
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:20,450
 

1537
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:22,930
 the location was moved what does that

1538
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,930
 

1539
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:22,930
 mean

1540
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:25,050
 

1541
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:30,850
 there's the magic spot it means that

1542
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:30,850
 

1543
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:33,770
 there's another algorithm hidden in here

1544
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,770
 

1545
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:37,910
 right it means that we can do a stable

1546
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,910
 

1547
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:40,700
 partition without having to look at each

1548
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,700
 

1549
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:43,310
 item to say are you selected but to say

1550
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:43,310
 

1551
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:45,290
 is your position selected which means

1552
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,290
 

1553
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:49,250
 that we can keep our selection out of

1554
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,250
 

1555
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:52,880
 our data okay so we don't have to go

1556
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,880
 

1557
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:54,800
 stick a bunch of boolean's in our big

1558
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:54,800
 

1559
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,840
 huge lists of things so that we can mark

1560
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,840
 

1561
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,750
 them to say are you selected we can keep

1562
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:59,750
 

1563
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:02,210
 an interval set over on the side to say

1564
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:02,210
 

1565
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:03,680
 are you selected and we can still apply

1566
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,680
 

1567
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:08,090
 gather to put everything in the right

1568
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:08,090
 

1569
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:09,800
 place all right I think that's very

1570
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,800
 

1571
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:16,670
 beautiful do you think it's beautiful

1572
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:16,670
 

1573
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:18,050
 you guys follow it yeah okay so we can

1574
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,050
 

1575
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:19,460
 do something like this right we can have

1576
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,460
 

1577
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:22,130
 our interval set that represents our

1578
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:22,130
 

1579
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:24,350
 selection the user modifies at a bunch

1580
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,350
 

1581
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:27,790
 and then we can say gather position and

1582
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:27,790
 

1583
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:27,790
 put everything into the right place

1584
00:39:31,589 --> 00:39:31,589
 

1585
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:38,609
 okay so selections multi-select has only

1586
00:39:36,209 --> 00:39:38,609
 

1587
00:39:36,219 --> 00:39:43,209
 sporadically implemented in applications

1588
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:43,209
 

1589
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:47,680
 it is always and I say this pretty much

1590
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:47,680
 

1591
00:39:43,209 --> 00:39:52,479
 unqualified always inconsistently how do

1592
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:52,479
 

1593
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:56,229
 I know that so a few years ago Yakko

1594
00:39:52,469 --> 00:39:56,229
 

1595
00:39:52,479 --> 00:39:58,059
 Garvey at the time he was professor at

1596
00:39:56,219 --> 00:39:58,059
 

1597
00:39:56,229 --> 00:39:58,749
 Texas A&M I think now he's at University

1598
00:39:58,049 --> 00:39:58,749
 

1599
00:39:58,059 --> 00:40:02,170
 of Oslo

1600
00:39:58,739 --> 00:40:02,170
 

1601
00:39:58,749 --> 00:40:04,779
 you know I've collaborated a lot he's

1602
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,779
 

1603
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:07,150
 largely responsible for lambdas and C++

1604
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:07,150
 

1605
00:40:04,779 --> 00:40:08,920
 so you have him to thank for lambdas he

1606
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,920
 

1607
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:15,009
 also wrote the lamda library that was in

1608
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:15,009
 

1609
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:17,380
 boost he and I sat down to write a

1610
00:40:14,999 --> 00:40:17,380
 

1611
00:40:15,009 --> 00:40:20,469
 different paper about collections and

1612
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:20,469
 

1613
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:24,190
 user interfaces on collections and we

1614
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:24,190
 

1615
00:40:20,469 --> 00:40:26,199
 got hung up on selections what did it

1616
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:26,199
 

1617
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:28,869
 mean to select things within

1618
00:40:26,189 --> 00:40:28,869
 

1619
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:30,759
 applications and we went into the survey

1620
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:30,759
 

1621
00:40:28,869 --> 00:40:32,829
 of a whole bunch of applications which

1622
00:40:30,749 --> 00:40:32,829
 

1623
00:40:30,759 --> 00:40:35,920
 are referenced in this paper find it on

1624
00:40:32,819 --> 00:40:35,920
 

1625
00:40:32,829 --> 00:40:38,650
 my website and we found like every

1626
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:38,650
 

1627
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:40,569
 application implements multiple

1628
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,569
 

1629
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:42,579
 selections differently and you think

1630
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:42,579
 

1631
00:40:40,569 --> 00:40:45,969
 it's kind of easy right cuz you say well

1632
00:40:42,569 --> 00:40:45,969
 

1633
00:40:42,579 --> 00:40:47,469
 I can click on something and then I can

1634
00:40:45,959 --> 00:40:47,469
 

1635
00:40:45,969 --> 00:40:49,989
 shift-click someplace else and that

1636
00:40:47,459 --> 00:40:49,989
 

1637
00:40:47,469 --> 00:40:52,299
 should select a range and then I can

1638
00:40:49,979 --> 00:40:52,299
 

1639
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:55,569
 command click someplace to make it a

1640
00:40:52,289 --> 00:40:55,569
 

1641
00:40:52,299 --> 00:40:57,309
 disjoint range okay but what happens if

1642
00:40:55,559 --> 00:40:57,309
 

1643
00:40:55,569 --> 00:41:00,579
 i shift-click and nothing was selected

1644
00:40:57,299 --> 00:41:00,579
 

1645
00:40:57,309 --> 00:41:02,049
 right or what happens if I command click

1646
00:41:00,569 --> 00:41:02,049
 

1647
00:41:00,579 --> 00:41:04,779
 on something that was already selected

1648
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:04,779
 

1649
00:41:02,049 --> 00:41:06,789
 or the range that I'm shift-clicking the

1650
00:41:04,769 --> 00:41:06,789
 

1651
00:41:04,779 --> 00:41:10,029
 club across had things that were

1652
00:41:06,779 --> 00:41:10,029
 

1653
00:41:06,789 --> 00:41:12,369
 selected within that range every

1654
00:41:10,019 --> 00:41:12,369
 

1655
00:41:10,029 --> 00:41:15,219
 application implements those differently

1656
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:15,219
 

1657
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:18,009
 right call it an artifact of

1658
00:41:15,209 --> 00:41:18,009
 

1659
00:41:15,219 --> 00:41:20,799
 implementation the problem with that is

1660
00:41:17,999 --> 00:41:20,799
 

1661
00:41:18,009 --> 00:41:22,509
 it both means that there's no central

1662
00:41:20,789 --> 00:41:22,509
 

1663
00:41:20,799 --> 00:41:25,059
 design for it there's nothing that a

1664
00:41:22,499 --> 00:41:25,059
 

1665
00:41:22,509 --> 00:41:27,789
 user can rely upon when a user is

1666
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:27,789
 

1667
00:41:25,059 --> 00:41:30,009
 building selections okay

1668
00:41:27,779 --> 00:41:30,009
 

1669
00:41:27,789 --> 00:41:31,619
 so users find it very confusing and

1670
00:41:29,999 --> 00:41:31,619
 

1671
00:41:30,009 --> 00:41:34,420
 users don't trust the system

1672
00:41:31,609 --> 00:41:34,420
 

1673
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:38,109
 okay it also means that nobody's written

1674
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:38,109
 

1675
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:39,910
 a good generic piece of code on there so

1676
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:39,910
 

1677
00:41:38,109 --> 00:41:41,559
 yakko and I ended up not writing the

1678
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,559
 

1679
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:44,100
 people we intended to write we just

1680
00:41:41,549 --> 00:41:44,100
 

1681
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:46,080
 wrote a paper on selections

1682
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:46,080
 

1683
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:48,440
 and kind of a common vocabulary for how

1684
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,440
 

1685
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:51,450
 you would constructible construct

1686
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:51,450
 

1687
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:54,180
 selections okay so it's a bit of a

1688
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,180
 

1689
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:56,000
 mathematical paper but it's also a

1690
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:56,000
 

1691
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:57,810
 universal form for talking about

1692
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:57,810
 

1693
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,150
 selections whether you're selecting

1694
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,150
 

1695
00:41:57,810 --> 00:42:02,970
 things within a sequence or objects

1696
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:02,970
 

1697
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:05,310
 within an arbitrary space it scales to

1698
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,310
 

1699
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:07,290
 end dimensions right so it's a nice

1700
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,290
 

1701
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:09,060
 little piece of work so if you're

1702
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,060
 

1703
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:10,410
 implementing an application where you

1704
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:10,410
 

1705
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:12,300
 have collections of things and you need

1706
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,300
 

1707
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:14,510
 to select them I'd recommend reading the

1708
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:14,510
 

1709
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,510
 paper

1710
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:15,490
 

1711
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:22,770
 that brings us to relationships so a

1712
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,770
 

1713
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:24,960
 relationship is the way the two entities

1714
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,960
 

1715
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:27,060
 are connected relationships within

1716
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:27,060
 

1717
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,830
 software and avoidable relationships

1718
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:28,830
 

1719
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:31,230
 come up a lot in my talks I would say

1720
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:31,230
 

1721
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:37,550
 the problem with computer scientists are

1722
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:37,550
 

1723
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:40,380
 that we're bad at relationships so a

1724
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:40,380
 

1725
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:41,910
 structure is formed by collected by

1726
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:41,910
 

1727
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:44,400
 connected relationships that's what a

1728
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,400
 

1729
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:47,100
 mathematical structure is as a set of

1730
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:47,100
 

1731
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:49,200
 connected relationships and architecture

1732
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:49,200
 

1733
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:50,850
 is the art and design of designing

1734
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:50,850
 

1735
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:54,510
 structures that's the definition of

1736
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:54,510
 

1737
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:57,900
 architecture right the reason why some

1738
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,900
 

1739
00:42:54,510 --> 00:43:00,240
 of us are called software architects is

1740
00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:00,240
 

1741
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:01,740
 because were the people who are worried

1742
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:01,740
 

1743
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:04,380
 about the relationships of how the

1744
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:04,380
 

1745
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:06,180
 software is put together and it's our

1746
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:06,180
 

1747
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:09,600
 responsibility to design those

1748
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:09,600
 

1749
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:11,580
 structures I find a lot of software

1750
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:11,580
 

1751
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:13,440
 architects with that in their title who

1752
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:13,440
 

1753
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:15,720
 can't give me a definition of what

1754
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:15,720
 

1755
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:18,060
 software architecture is but that's what

1756
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:18,060
 

1757
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:19,980
 software architecture is okay it's

1758
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:19,980
 

1759
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:21,900
 designing the structure of relationships

1760
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:21,900
 

1761
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:28,320
 how the components within your software

1762
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:28,320
 

1763
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:30,720
 connect a relationship always implies a

1764
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:30,720
 

1765
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:32,550
 corresponding predicate the tests if the

1766
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:32,550
 

1767
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:35,850
 pair are in the relationship or not

1768
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:35,850
 

1769
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:38,120
 right so you can be in a relationship I

1770
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,120
 

1771
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:41,280
 happen to know that Marshall is married

1772
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:41,280
 

1773
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:42,960
 so so Marshall is married to his wife

1774
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:42,960
 

1775
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,940
 and so there is a corresponding

1776
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:44,940
 

1777
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:49,920
 predicate that I can ask is Marshall

1778
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:49,920
 

1779
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:52,980
 married right very simple

1780
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:52,980
 

1781
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:55,440
 within a tie race relationships can be

1782
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:55,440
 

1783
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:58,340
 very challenging to represent and to

1784
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:58,340
 

1785
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,340
 convey to the user

1786
00:43:59,609 --> 00:43:59,609
 

1787
00:43:59,619 --> 00:44:05,270
 so look at this picture for a moment so

1788
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,270
 

1789
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:10,550
 this was my hotel room when I gave this

1790
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:10,550
 

1791
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:13,250
 talk in Berlin it's not quite as bad as

1792
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:13,250
 

1793
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:14,690
 the picture would make you think the

1794
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,690
 

1795
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:19,609
 beginning went there you're looking at

1796
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:19,609
 

1797
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:23,349
 the shower okay and the toilet what you

1798
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:23,349
 

1799
00:44:19,609 --> 00:44:25,910
 can't quite see is there is a clear

1800
00:44:23,339 --> 00:44:25,910
 

1801
00:44:23,349 --> 00:44:31,450
 plane of glass right between the two

1802
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:31,450
 

1803
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:36,250
 there's no mirrors in this picture okay

1804
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:36,250
 

1805
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:39,200
 this just struck me as funny all right

1806
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,200
 

1807
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:43,339
 so I thought somewhere out there there's

1808
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:43,339
 

1809
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:45,410
 an interior designer who missed their

1810
00:44:43,329 --> 00:44:45,410
 

1811
00:44:43,339 --> 00:44:51,950
 calling they should have been a software

1812
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:51,950
 

1813
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:54,470
 engineer okay because somebody gave them

1814
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:54,470
 

1815
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:56,900
 this requirements they said I want you

1816
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:56,900
 

1817
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:58,520
 to design a bathroom and I want you to

1818
00:44:56,890 --> 00:44:58,520
 

1819
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:01,910
 have at least one shower in the bathroom

1820
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:01,910
 

1821
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:04,819
 and the designer said okay number of

1822
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:04,819
 

1823
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:07,450
 showers is equal to one constraint

1824
00:45:04,809 --> 00:45:07,450
 

1825
00:45:04,819 --> 00:45:07,450
 satisfied

1826
00:45:08,569 --> 00:45:08,569
 

1827
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:12,970
 and somebody came along and said oh and

1828
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:12,970
 

1829
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:15,400
 that bathroom should have at least one

1830
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,400
 

1831
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:19,049
 toilet does I understood I can do that

1832
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:19,049
 

1833
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:23,349
 it number of toilets is equal to one

1834
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:23,349
 

1835
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:26,260
 constraint satisfied and so the owner of

1836
00:45:23,339 --> 00:45:26,260
 

1837
00:45:23,349 --> 00:45:30,030
 the hotel came back and said and this

1838
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:30,030
 

1839
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:31,960
 bathroom should provide some privacy

1840
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:31,960
 

1841
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:37,829
 privacy should be greater than or equal

1842
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:37,829
 

1843
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:37,829
 to zero privacy is equal to zero

1844
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:38,030
 

1845
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:49,230
 constraint satisfied clearly miss Nicole

1846
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:49,970
 

1847
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:54,250
 so one of the simplest relationships

1848
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:54,250
 

1849
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:56,890
 that you'll run acrost in software and

1850
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,890
 

1851
00:45:54,250 --> 00:46:01,809
 one of the most common is the implies

1852
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,809
 

1853
00:45:56,890 --> 00:46:03,730
 relationship a implies B okay how common

1854
00:46:01,799 --> 00:46:03,730
 

1855
00:46:01,809 --> 00:46:05,980
 is this well I just pulled up the manual

1856
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,980
 

1857
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:09,010
 for clang and search for the word

1858
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:09,010
 

1859
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:11,230
 implies or implied and this is the

1860
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,230
 

1861
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:14,109
 number of cases where where it occurs

1862
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:14,109
 

1863
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:16,480
 right so those options implies another

1864
00:46:14,099 --> 00:46:16,480
 

1865
00:46:14,109 --> 00:46:19,450
 option this option is implied by some

1866
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:19,450
 

1867
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:20,890
 other option okay it comes up a lot so

1868
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,890
 

1869
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:22,780
 if you were constructing a user

1870
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,780
 

1871
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:24,970
 interface and putting checkboxes on each

1872
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:24,970
 

1873
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:27,309
 of these options you would want some way

1874
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,309
 

1875
00:46:24,970 --> 00:46:33,280
 to represent that implies relationship

1876
00:46:27,299 --> 00:46:33,280
 

1877
00:46:27,309 --> 00:46:37,630
 to the user okay so let's take a look

1878
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:37,630
 

1879
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:39,099
 here I built a little app this is an iOS

1880
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:39,099
 

1881
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:41,349
 app that I built and it's just gonna

1882
00:46:39,089 --> 00:46:41,349
 

1883
00:46:39,099 --> 00:46:43,299
 keep running in a loop here and the user

1884
00:46:41,339 --> 00:46:43,299
 

1885
00:46:41,349 --> 00:46:49,750
 can click through things and the

1886
00:46:43,289 --> 00:46:49,750
 

1887
00:46:43,299 --> 00:46:52,540
 operation is getting applied after the

1888
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,540
 

1889
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:54,549
 dot dot there right we need to make sure

1890
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:54,549
 

1891
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:57,369
 that B is consistent with the implies

1892
00:46:54,539 --> 00:46:57,369
 

1893
00:46:54,549 --> 00:46:58,660
 relationship so in the code that user

1894
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:58,660
 

1895
00:46:57,369 --> 00:47:01,930
 wrote this piece of code for the

1896
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:01,930
 

1897
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:04,329
 operation and they said oh I'm gonna

1898
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,329
 

1899
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:08,079
 take two arguments a and B but I'm gonna

1900
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:08,079
 

1901
00:47:04,329 --> 00:47:11,650
 say B is equal to a or b right inside

1902
00:47:08,069 --> 00:47:11,650
 

1903
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:13,030
 right you can use a implies B and I'm

1904
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,030
 

1905
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:14,619
 just gonna put an unconstrained user

1906
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:14,619
 

1907
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:18,099
 interface attached to that and the user

1908
00:47:14,609 --> 00:47:18,099
 

1909
00:47:14,619 --> 00:47:20,319
 can click on anything okay and the

1910
00:47:18,089 --> 00:47:20,319
 

1911
00:47:18,099 --> 00:47:21,280
 operation works right the old green

1912
00:47:20,309 --> 00:47:21,280
 

1913
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:25,470
 light it doesn't

1914
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:25,470
 

1915
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:27,820
 operation the application works okay but

1916
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:27,820
 

1917
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:32,530
 somebody in QE is gonna come along and

1918
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:32,530
 

1919
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:35,970
 say say that's all very nice but when I

1920
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:35,970
 

1921
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:44,890
 saved you a and not B it still does be

1922
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:44,890
 

1923
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:48,310
 okay and I didn't see that in the UI so

1924
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,310
 

1925
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:49,260
 the engineer says I can fix that bug no

1926
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,260
 

1927
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:53,940
 problem

1928
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:53,940
 

1929
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:58,210
 here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna say

1930
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:58,210
 

1931
00:47:53,940 --> 00:48:04,240
 if switch a is on then set switch B to

1932
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:04,240
 

1933
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:06,610
 be on okay fix the bug okay and now I'm

1934
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:06,610
 

1935
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:09,160
 just gonna I don't need the code anymore

1936
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,160
 

1937
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:10,840
 to fix up B so I'm just gonna change it

1938
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:10,840
 

1939
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:13,900
 to in a search to make sure I got my

1940
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:13,900
 

1941
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:18,850
 code right okay

1942
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:18,850
 

1943
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:20,590
 are we good yeah who sees the bug ain't

1944
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,590
 

1945
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:24,280
 no one person laughing a couple people

1946
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:24,280
 

1947
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:27,040
 see the bug right so what happens here

1948
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:27,040
 

1949
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:30,520
 we can do that and we're good we can

1950
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:30,520
 

1951
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:32,770
 click on B yeah we're still good we can

1952
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:32,770
 

1953
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:35,470
 unclick and be in click a B gets clicked

1954
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:35,470
 

1955
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:39,790
 over hey we're still good we can unclick

1956
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:39,790
 

1957
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:44,200
 B boom our search fires okay and we

1958
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:44,200
 

1959
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:48,280
 crash right everybody see why right

1960
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:48,280
 

1961
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:52,740
 right we fixed it up but only along one

1962
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:52,740
 

1963
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:55,840
 path of direction only one a you changed

1964
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:55,840
 

1965
00:48:52,740 --> 00:49:00,370
 okay so that generates another bug comes

1966
00:48:55,830 --> 00:49:00,370
 

1967
00:48:55,840 --> 00:49:01,450
 back to the engineer so the engineer is

1968
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:01,450
 

1969
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:03,610
 very happy that he at least got the

1970
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,610
 

1971
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:05,650
 assert so he's using strong

1972
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,650
 

1973
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:08,110
 preconditions and asserting them soon

1974
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:08,110
 

1975
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:10,360
 we're gonna have design by contract in

1976
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:10,360
 

1977
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:14,710
 the language so we could have made that

1978
00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:14,710
 

1979
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:20,950
 a contract okay so here's what the user

1980
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:20,950
 

1981
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:26,470
 does he says okay switch B is only going

1982
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:26,470
 

1983
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:29,530
 to be enabled if a is not on okay and if

1984
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:29,530
 

1985
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:34,480
 switch a gets turned on then switch B

1986
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:34,480
 

1987
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:35,660
 will get set to true okay so now we're

1988
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:35,660
 

1989
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,180
 preventing

1990
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:38,180
 

1991
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:43,400
 that of the case right our switches to

1992
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:43,400
 

1993
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:45,380
 save one and we're having here what's

1994
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:45,380
 

1995
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:47,030
 the next bug that gets generated right

1996
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:47,030
 

1997
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:53,119
 this all works this is good you could

1998
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:53,119
 

1999
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:54,289
 ship this product okay well if you work

2000
00:49:53,109 --> 00:49:54,289
 

2001
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:55,730
 with the designers that I work with

2002
00:49:54,279 --> 00:49:55,730
 

2003
00:49:54,289 --> 00:49:58,819
 they're gonna come along and they're

2004
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:58,819
 

2005
00:49:55,730 --> 00:50:01,250
 gonna say hey there's a rouble here that

2006
00:49:58,809 --> 00:50:01,250
 

2007
00:49:58,819 --> 00:50:04,490
 says that if I toggle the control if I

2008
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:04,490
 

2009
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:06,890
 toggle a checkbox on and off then the

2010
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,890
 

2011
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:12,260
 system should go back to its previous

2012
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:12,260
 

2013
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:16,910
 state okay so what happens here I click

2014
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:16,910
 

2015
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:20,900
 a on B goes to off I unclick a B doesn't

2016
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:20,900
 

2017
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:26,020
 go back to its previous state okay so

2018
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:26,020
 

2019
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:26,020
 I'm violating one of my designers rules

2020
00:50:27,779 --> 00:50:27,779
 

2021
00:50:27,789 --> 00:50:33,470
 so we could fix that okay so what are we

2022
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:33,470
 

2023
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,910
 gonna have to do now now we're gonna

2024
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:34,910
 

2025
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:38,000
 have to keep some shadow state to

2026
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:38,000
 

2027
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:42,589
 remember what the state of B was okay

2028
00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:42,589
 

2029
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:45,619
 and then which B whether or not it's on

2030
00:50:42,579 --> 00:50:45,619
 

2031
00:50:42,589 --> 00:50:47,480
 or off is going to be if switch a is on

2032
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:47,480
 

2033
00:50:45,619 --> 00:50:50,839
 then it's on or it's going to be its

2034
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:50,839
 

2035
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:54,549
 prior value for switch B okay

2036
00:50:50,829 --> 00:50:54,549
 

2037
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:57,349
 or logic it's a little more complicated

2038
00:50:54,539 --> 00:50:57,349
 

2039
00:50:54,549 --> 00:51:00,500
 so now it's very nice if I toggle eight

2040
00:50:57,339 --> 00:51:00,500
 

2041
00:50:57,349 --> 00:51:03,369
 on and off then he goes back to its

2042
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:03,369
 

2043
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:07,339
 previous state regardless of what it was

2044
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:07,339
 

2045
00:51:03,369 --> 00:51:13,730
 okay we're happy we ship the product

2046
00:51:07,329 --> 00:51:13,730
 

2047
00:51:07,339 --> 00:51:17,960
 again you know the designer comes back

2048
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:17,960
 

2049
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:21,109
 and says you know users have a problem

2050
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:21,109
 

2051
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:25,460
 they don't know why B's disabled right

2052
00:51:21,099 --> 00:51:25,460
 

2053
00:51:21,109 --> 00:51:29,990
 why can't I click on B okay and the

2054
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:29,990
 

2055
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:32,960
 engineer says I know logic there's this

2056
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:32,960
 

2057
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:34,819
 thing called a contrapositive okay which

2058
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:34,819
 

2059
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:38,029
 means that if a implies B either not be

2060
00:51:34,809 --> 00:51:38,029
 

2061
00:51:34,819 --> 00:51:39,630
 implies not a so how about if we express

2062
00:51:38,019 --> 00:51:39,630
 

2063
00:51:38,029 --> 00:51:45,479
 that in the code

2064
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:45,479
 

2065
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:47,069
 not B implies not a okay and I know that

2066
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:47,069
 

2067
00:51:45,479 --> 00:51:49,410
 my toggle should always go back in the

2068
00:51:47,059 --> 00:51:49,410
 

2069
00:51:47,069 --> 00:51:52,140
 right position so now I'm gonna keep

2070
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,140
 

2071
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:54,150
 memory on a and B and I'm gonna Express

2072
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:54,150
 

2073
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:56,099
 both of those relationships and I'm

2074
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:56,099
 

2075
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:59,519
 going to put that together and this is

2076
00:51:56,089 --> 00:51:59,519
 

2077
00:51:56,099 --> 00:52:01,079
 the UI that's now you can kind of watch

2078
00:51:59,509 --> 00:52:01,079
 

2079
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:04,589
 this for a minute as it's clicking

2080
00:52:01,069 --> 00:52:04,589
 

2081
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:07,799
 through a bunch of stays here what the

2082
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:07,799
 

2083
00:52:04,589 --> 00:52:13,349
 hell right right try to predict what's

2084
00:52:07,789 --> 00:52:13,349
 

2085
00:52:07,799 --> 00:52:16,079
 going to happen okay this is completely

2086
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:16,079
 

2087
00:52:13,349 --> 00:52:18,720
 correct my operation always succeeds I'm

2088
00:52:16,069 --> 00:52:18,720
 

2089
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:20,940
 obeying my rule that says when I click

2090
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:20,940
 

2091
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:22,979
 on this it toggles the user interface it

2092
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:22,979
 

2093
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:24,720
 clicks back and forth I don't have to

2094
00:52:22,969 --> 00:52:24,720
 

2095
00:52:22,979 --> 00:52:26,640
 explain to my user why my thing is

2096
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:26,640
 

2097
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:28,229
 disabled because it's always enabled I

2098
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:28,229
 

2099
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,029
 can click anywhere at any time and

2100
00:52:28,219 --> 00:52:30,029
 

2101
00:52:28,229 --> 00:52:32,249
 something unexpected and magical will

2102
00:52:30,019 --> 00:52:32,249
 

2103
00:52:30,029 --> 00:52:41,970
 happen and I'm standing on one foot and

2104
00:52:32,239 --> 00:52:41,970
 

2105
00:52:32,249 --> 00:52:45,390
 I'm patting myself on the head okay okay

2106
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:45,390
 

2107
00:52:41,970 --> 00:52:47,640
 so we can say okay okay memory was too

2108
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:47,640
 

2109
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:50,630
 much we'll go back to contrapositive but

2110
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:50,630
 

2111
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:53,309
 we'll take out the memory will do that

2112
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:53,309
 

2113
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:56,759
 and we have another user interface and

2114
00:52:53,299 --> 00:52:56,759
 

2115
00:52:53,309 --> 00:52:59,910
 it works people are somewhat happy again

2116
00:52:56,749 --> 00:52:59,910
 

2117
00:52:56,759 --> 00:53:03,869
 and we'll ship this one again okay so

2118
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:03,869
 

2119
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:07,049
 now we've shipped three versions of this

2120
00:53:03,859 --> 00:53:07,049
 

2121
00:53:03,869 --> 00:53:09,180
 we've rejected three versions only one

2122
00:53:07,039 --> 00:53:09,180
 

2123
00:53:07,049 --> 00:53:11,430
 of those three versions was buggy we

2124
00:53:09,170 --> 00:53:11,430
 

2125
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:13,859
 have six versions of this code we had

2126
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:13,859
 

2127
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:16,049
 two checkboxes we have now spent days

2128
00:53:13,849 --> 00:53:16,049
 

2129
00:53:13,859 --> 00:53:19,769
 and days and days arguing about the

2130
00:53:16,039 --> 00:53:19,769
 

2131
00:53:16,049 --> 00:53:21,660
 behavior of this okay and we will do it

2132
00:53:19,759 --> 00:53:21,660
 

2133
00:53:19,769 --> 00:53:25,710
 again the next time we have a

2134
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:25,710
 

2135
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:27,749
 relationship of a implies B because we

2136
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:27,749
 

2137
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:30,029
 never define what the rule was what's

2138
00:53:27,739 --> 00:53:30,029
 

2139
00:53:27,749 --> 00:53:31,829
 the correct answer of the three that we

2140
00:53:30,019 --> 00:53:31,829
 

2141
00:53:30,029 --> 00:53:35,130
 shipped what's the correct answer I

2142
00:53:31,819 --> 00:53:35,130
 

2143
00:53:31,829 --> 00:53:39,809
 don't know okay so we'll have this

2144
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:39,809
 

2145
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:42,150
 argument every single time well I was

2146
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:42,150
 

2147
00:53:39,809 --> 00:53:43,680
 putting together these slides oh I was

2148
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:43,680
 

2149
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:46,460
 gonna say another operation would be

2150
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:46,460
 

2151
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:46,460
 that we could do it

2152
00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:46,870
 

2153
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,150
 unconstrained here

2154
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:53,210
 

2155
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:58,510
 strain but with the disabled in

2156
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:58,510
 

2157
00:53:55,720 --> 00:54:03,340
 operation well I was putting together

2158
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:03,340
 

2159
00:53:58,510 --> 00:54:05,590
 these slides this came across our slack

2160
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:05,590
 

2161
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:08,290
 channel this is a sketch from one of our

2162
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:08,290
 

2163
00:54:05,590 --> 00:54:09,580
 designers got some humorous text down

2164
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,580
 

2165
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:12,490
 here at the bottom you probably can't

2166
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:12,490
 

2167
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:15,430
 read it you know it's a hidden layer and

2168
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,430
 

2169
00:54:12,490 --> 00:54:21,310
 a normal layer and the hidden group walk

2170
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:21,310
 

2171
00:54:15,430 --> 00:54:23,920
 into a bar but the question here is to

2172
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,920
 

2173
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:25,900
 say okay I've got a layer and I've got a

2174
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:25,900
 

2175
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:29,110
 child of the layer and the layer is the

2176
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:29,110
 

2177
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:32,280
 root is hidden and so that implies that

2178
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:32,280
 

2179
00:54:29,110 --> 00:54:35,260
 the child is hidden and then I'm making

2180
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:35,260
 

2181
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:37,690
 the child layer which is what selected

2182
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:37,690
 

2183
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:39,040
 in blue down below explicitly visible

2184
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,040
 

2185
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:41,290
 and it's actually part of a multiple

2186
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:41,290
 

2187
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:45,460
 selection and that has an implication

2188
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:45,460
 

2189
00:54:41,290 --> 00:54:49,600
 relationships with its parent at a okay

2190
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:49,600
 

2191
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:51,520
 so in order for the child to be actually

2192
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:51,520
 

2193
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:56,820
 visible the parent also has to be

2194
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:56,820
 

2195
00:54:51,520 --> 00:55:00,460
 visible and he asks how do I do this

2196
00:54:56,810 --> 00:55:00,460
 

2197
00:54:56,820 --> 00:55:06,250
 right my answer is I can give you a lot

2198
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:06,250
 

2199
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:09,000
 of ways you can do this the question

2200
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:09,000
 

2201
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:11,110
 should be how do we do this in general

2202
00:55:08,990 --> 00:55:11,110
 

2203
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:14,860
 what's the rule that we're going to

2204
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:14,860
 

2205
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:16,600
 follow always okay let's stop having

2206
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:16,600
 

2207
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:24,100
 this conversation over and over and over

2208
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:24,100
 

2209
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:27,940
 again the industry is very bad so what

2210
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:27,940
 

2211
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:29,290
 is a good design right in this context

2212
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:29,290
 

2213
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:30,970
 we were talking toggling the control

2214
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,970
 

2215
00:55:29,290 --> 00:55:32,740
 should restore the system to its

2216
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,740
 

2217
00:55:30,970 --> 00:55:34,360
 original state that's a good design goal

2218
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:34,360
 

2219
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:36,070
 result of the click should be

2220
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:36,070
 

2221
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:39,040
 predictable without knowing how current

2222
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:39,040
 

2223
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:40,000
 state was achieved that's a good thing

2224
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:40,000
 

2225
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,320
 you ought to be able to look at a user

2226
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:41,320
 

2227
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,380
 interface know what will happen if you

2228
00:55:41,310 --> 00:55:44,380
 

2229
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:46,090
 click on something right guided pass

2230
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:46,090
 

2231
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:48,100
 things that direct the user when we

2232
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,100
 

2233
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:50,530
 disable controls things like that are

2234
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:50,530
 

2235
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:52,420
 our preferred so long as they don't make

2236
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,420
 

2237
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:54,790
 navigation difficult the user has to

2238
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:54,790
 

2239
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:56,620
 understand why things are disabled right

2240
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:56,620
 

2241
00:55:54,790 --> 00:55:59,020
 but there needs to be additional rules

2242
00:55:56,610 --> 00:55:59,020
 

2243
00:55:56,620 --> 00:56:01,030
 all of these rules run into conflict as

2244
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:01,030
 

2245
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:03,640
 soon as you stick a simple relationship

2246
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:03,640
 

2247
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:05,740
 between elements under the hood right

2248
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:05,740
 

2249
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:08,650
 and the rules need to be dry

2250
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:08,650
 

2251
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:11,800
 from existing conventions from user

2252
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,800
 

2253
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:12,760
 experience and from studies alright so

2254
00:56:11,790 --> 00:56:12,760
 

2255
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:14,349
 if you're working with you user

2256
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:14,349
 

2257
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:16,930
 interface designer they shouldn't be

2258
00:56:14,339 --> 00:56:16,930
 

2259
00:56:14,349 --> 00:56:19,060
 sitting alone coming up with what their

2260
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,060
 

2261
00:56:16,930 --> 00:56:21,130
 answer should be they have to be looking

2262
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:21,130
 

2263
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:24,339
 at what does everybody else do what does

2264
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:24,339
 

2265
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:25,990
 what two users expect do a user study to

2266
00:56:24,329 --> 00:56:25,990
 

2267
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:28,320
 come to an understanding of what the

2268
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:28,320
 

2269
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:33,820
 correct answer is and then apply that

2270
00:56:28,310 --> 00:56:33,820
 

2271
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:36,670
 consistently than the application now

2272
00:56:33,810 --> 00:56:36,670
 

2273
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:38,770
 I've spent a number of years working on

2274
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:38,770
 

2275
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:41,170
 a system called property models which

2276
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:41,170
 

2277
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:43,270
 has some amount of use inside of Adobe I

2278
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:43,270
 

2279
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:47,849
 wish I could spend more time working on

2280
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:47,849
 

2281
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:50,589
 it it's it's open sourced github /su app

2282
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:50,589
 

2283
00:56:47,849 --> 00:56:52,839
 but all of the examples that I just

2284
00:56:50,579 --> 00:56:52,839
 

2285
00:56:50,589 --> 00:56:54,910
 showed this is the way you would express

2286
00:56:52,829 --> 00:56:54,910
 

2287
00:56:52,839 --> 00:56:56,470
 all of those relationships inside of a

2288
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:56,470
 

2289
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:59,619
 property model they're all kind of one

2290
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:59,619
 

2291
00:56:56,470 --> 00:57:01,570
 line right all right so I can build a

2292
00:56:59,609 --> 00:57:01,570
 

2293
00:56:59,619 --> 00:57:03,369
 system to let you express relationships

2294
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,369
 

2295
00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:06,540
 and to solve these systems but I still

2296
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:06,540
 

2297
00:57:03,369 --> 00:57:08,830
 can't tell you what the right answer is

2298
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:08,830
 

2299
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:11,260
 right so these are papers that I've

2300
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:11,260
 

2301
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:13,780
 written about property models and why

2302
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:13,780
 

2303
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:19,510
 they exist how to build them all those

2304
00:57:13,770 --> 00:57:19,510
 

2305
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:23,230
 mean user interfaces model so closing

2306
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:23,230
 

2307
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:24,760
 here good code is necessary right but

2308
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:24,760
 

2309
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:27,130
 it's not sufficient for building a good

2310
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:27,130
 

2311
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:28,750
 UI there's significant work in the area

2312
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:28,750
 

2313
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:30,820
 of data structures and algorithms to

2314
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:30,820
 

2315
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:33,250
 really support the UI is I don't think

2316
00:57:30,810 --> 00:57:33,250
 

2317
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:36,220
 our platform vendors do enough to assist

2318
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:36,220
 

2319
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:39,460
 us in this area right and there's still

2320
00:57:36,210 --> 00:57:39,460
 

2321
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:42,070
 significant work remaining there's huge

2322
00:57:39,450 --> 00:57:42,070
 

2323
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:43,810
 amounts of work every time I pick up a

2324
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:43,810
 

2325
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:47,440
 new application install it on my phone

2326
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:47,440
 

2327
00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:49,690
 or my laptop right I've been in this

2328
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:49,690
 

2329
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:52,690
 area of research for so long I just

2330
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:52,690
 

2331
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:55,030
 cringe right I can't make a selection

2332
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:55,030
 

2333
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:56,500
 selections are inconsistent if I do make

2334
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:56,500
 

2335
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:58,030
 a selection I can't apply the operation

2336
00:57:56,490 --> 00:57:58,030
 

2337
00:57:56,500 --> 00:58:01,030
 but I should be able to do to this

2338
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:01,030
 

2339
00:57:58,030 --> 00:58:03,460
 selection right I can't drag and drop I

2340
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:03,460
 

2341
00:58:01,030 --> 00:58:06,190
 click on things and things disabled and

2342
00:58:03,450 --> 00:58:06,190
 

2343
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:07,960
 I don't know why right one section of

2344
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:07,960
 

2345
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:10,330
 the application is inconsistent from the

2346
00:58:07,950 --> 00:58:10,330
 

2347
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:12,099
 other section of the application it's

2348
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,099
 

2349
00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:13,930
 true of even the products that they work

2350
00:58:12,089 --> 00:58:13,930
 

2351
00:58:12,099 --> 00:58:18,780
 on and I have hand in because I'm just

2352
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:18,780
 

2353
00:58:13,930 --> 00:58:18,780
 one engineer right in a large company

2354
00:58:20,049 --> 00:58:20,049
 

2355
00:58:20,059 --> 00:58:28,529
 so some references my slides will always

2356
00:58:24,769 --> 00:58:28,529
 

2357
00:58:24,779 --> 00:58:31,529
 be posted here parent st lab got CC

2358
00:58:28,519 --> 00:58:31,529
 

2359
00:58:28,529 --> 00:58:35,689
