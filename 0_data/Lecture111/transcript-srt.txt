00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:51,670
 all right please welcome our next

4
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,670
 

5
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:55,650
 speaker Amelia andersdotter we will talk

6
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,650
 

7
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:55,650
 about adventures in hard westernization

8
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:57,820
 

9
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:04,660
[Applause]

10
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:04,660
 

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,729
 yeah so I'm back and today I have slides

12
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,729
 

13
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:09,030
 so for everyone who likes pictures

14
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:09,030
 

15
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:11,979
 that's a very good that's very good news

16
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,979
 

17
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:14,500
 this is a table of contents which

18
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:14,500
 

19
00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:16,240
 doesn't actually list the first three

20
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,240
 

21
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,820
 slides because I ended up having

22
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,820
 

23
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,940
 formatting problems I'll be talking

24
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,940
 

25
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,880
 about some good news from Hardware

26
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,880
 

27
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:27,340
 standardization where companies are

28
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:27,340
 

29
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,680
 trying to address real privacy problems

30
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,680
 

31
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:32,110
 that we have had in Wireless local area

32
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,110
 

33
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,900
 networks in particular and then I'll be

34
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,900
 

35
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:37,060
 talking about some bad news which is

36
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,060
 

37
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:39,190
 that other companies are trying to make

38
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,190
 

39
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:41,860
 real tangible privacy and security

40
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,860
 

41
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:43,330
 improvements in mobile networks but

42
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,330
 

43
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:46,229
 they're not allowed to continue those

44
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,229
 

45
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:49,870
 endeavors from their political masters

46
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:49,870
 

47
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:52,180
 I'll also be trying to cover some ideas

48
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,180
 

49
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:54,970
 about what we can do as a community to

50
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,970
 

51
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:57,250
 ensure that good developments get the

52
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,250
 

53
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:59,680
 policy support that they need and the

54
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,680
 

55
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:04,030
 bad developments get the type of counter

56
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,030
 

57
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,680
 pushes that they deserve but first I

58
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,680
 

59
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,510
 wanted to talk a bit about the

60
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,510
 

61
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,869
 organization that has enabled me to be

62
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,869
 

63
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:11,560
 here today to talk about this topic

64
00:02:09,859 --> 00:02:11,560
 

65
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:14,290
 article 19

66
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,290
 

67
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:17,230
 it's a uk-based freedom of speech

68
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,230
 

69
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:19,900
 organization that has for five years

70
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,900
 

71
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:22,660
 been running a program on human rights

72
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,660
 

73
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:25,750
 and technical standards so the work of

74
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,750
 

75
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:27,640
 article 19 starts from this idea of

76
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,640
 

77
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:30,310
 which is really formulated by Krantz

78
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,310
 

79
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,200
 burg in the 1980s that technology might

80
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,200
 

81
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:36,549
 be neither good or bad but it's also not

82
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,549
 

83
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:38,830
 neutral so if technologies aren't

84
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:38,830
 

85
00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:40,450
 neutral that means from the perspective

86
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,450
 

87
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:44,680
 of human rights the technical design

88
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,680
 

89
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:46,630
 also matters we tried to introduce

90
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,630
 

91
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,670
 diversity into the technical design

92
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,670
 

93
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:50,890
 process and a focus on Human Rights

94
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,890
 

95
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:53,350
 values and what they mean for engineers

96
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,350
 

97
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:55,419
 and how engineers can reflect upon human

98
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,419
 

99
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:56,590
 rights when they are making the next

100
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:56,590
 

101
00:02:55,419 --> 00:03:00,129
 generation of

102
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,129
 

103
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:01,900
 products that say we've been doing work

104
00:03:00,119 --> 00:03:01,900
 

105
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:03,819
 in a range of organization over these

106
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,819
 

107
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:07,510
 years we started out that the internet

108
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:07,510
 

109
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:09,129
 Engineering Task Force IETF and I can

110
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,129
 

111
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:11,080
 which of course deals with the DNS

112
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:11,080
 

113
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:13,299
 system back in 2014

114
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:13,299
 

115
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,180
 since then the activities have been

116
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:16,180
 

117
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:19,510
 expanded into the Institute of the

118
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:19,510
 

119
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:22,090
 electric and electronical engineers the

120
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,090
 

121
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:23,500
 3gpp which does mobile network standards

122
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,500
 

123
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,269
 and also the International

124
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,269
 

125
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,180
 Telecommunications Union which is a

126
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:28,180
 

127
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:30,220
 United Nations body that roughly they're

128
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,220
 

129
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:33,819
 responsible for land area codes and

130
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,819
 

131
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:35,650
 telephone numbers we've been working on

132
00:03:33,809 --> 00:03:35,650
 

133
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:37,540
 developing human rights considerations

134
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,540
 

135
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:40,959
 that are meant to assist the technical

136
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,959
 

137
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:43,329
 design process in the IETF we have RFC

138
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:43,329
 

139
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,280
 80 to 80 which codifies human rights

140
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:45,280
 

141
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:47,620
 considerations for protocol developers

142
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,620
 

143
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,360
 and in the I Triple E we have these

144
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,360
 

145
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:52,030
 previously recommendations which are

146
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:52,030
 

147
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,010
 still in a draft form but they've been

148
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,010
 

149
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,840
 making big advancements in the last two

150
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,840
 

151
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:58,540
 years and we're hoping that at least in

152
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,540
 

153
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,450
 the next year a couple of years they

154
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,450
 

155
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:03,220
 might make it into a final kind of

156
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,220
 

157
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,900
 standards format where they can be

158
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,900
 

159
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:08,980
 actually applied and referred to as an

160
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:08,980
 

161
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:10,480
 authoritative I Triple E document when I

162
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,480
 

163
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,130
 want to give some words of caution about

164
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,130
 

165
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,250
 considerations and technical design

166
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,250
 

167
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:17,169
 process processes one of them is that

168
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,169
 

169
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:19,060
 standards are not mandatory all

170
00:04:17,159 --> 00:04:19,060
 

171
00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:21,370
 standards that are made are voluntary

172
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,370
 

173
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:24,639
 for private sector parties to apply or

174
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,639
 

175
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:27,310
 not developing the standards in spite of

176
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:27,310
 

177
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:31,120
 this limitation takes time money and

178
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,120
 

179
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:32,680
 commitment in many cases technical

180
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,680
 

181
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,870
 standards are simply written by those

182
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,870
 

183
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,820
 who show up so those that have the money

184
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,820
 

185
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:39,070
 to have a lot of Engineers to attend

186
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,070
 

187
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:42,460
 standards bodies and make proposals and

188
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,460
 

189
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:44,110
 research what barriers different aspects

190
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,110
 

191
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:48,099
 and developments need to be inserted to

192
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,099
 

193
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:50,740
 make next generation technologies but

194
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:50,740
 

195
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:52,690
 then there is a final kind of challenge

196
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,690
 

197
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,220
 of working with standards is that even

198
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,220
 

199
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,599
 if you have the most perfect standard

200
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,599
 

201
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,310
 ever written and then it takes into

202
00:04:55,589 --> 00:04:57,310
 

203
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:59,610
 account all of the human rights and

204
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,610
 

205
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:01,720
 privacy considerations you could imagine

206
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,720
 

207
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:06,280
 the fact is your standards is not

208
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:06,280
 

209
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:08,110
 impactful if it's not implemented so the

210
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,110
 

211
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,570
 article 19 we try to have this holistic

212
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,570
 

213
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:11,250
 approach where it's

214
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,250
 

215
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:14,190
 that if the technology is not designed

216
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,190
 

217
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:15,510
 to respect human rights probably human

218
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,510
 

219
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:18,540
 rights will not be respected by

220
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,540
 

221
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:20,550
 deploying the technology but also only

222
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,550
 

223
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,890
 having the design in place is not enough

224
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,890
 

225
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:25,710
 you need to have this holistic approach

226
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,710
 

227
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:29,310
 to the entire process of the product

228
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,310
 

229
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:30,930
 from design to market that sounds like

230
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,930
 

231
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:36,210
 I'm a marketing consultant consultant

232
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:36,210
 

233
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:38,130
 but bear with me yeah so my work for the

234
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,130
 

235
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,600
 past two years with article 19 has been

236
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,600
 

237
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,940
 mostly oriented towards hardware

238
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,940
 

239
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,580
 standards that means I have worked a lot

240
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:44,580
 

241
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:47,250
 in I Tripoli 802 with the standard that

242
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:47,250
 

243
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:49,530
 is formally called Wireless local area

244
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,530
 

245
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:51,330
 networks but in practice most of us

246
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,330
 

247
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:54,300
 encounter it in our day-to-day lives as

248
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,300
 

249
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:57,030
 Wi-Fi so Wi-Fi is actually a brand it's

250
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:57,030
 

251
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,440
 maintained by the Wi-Fi Alliance which

252
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,440
 

253
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:00,810
 is a separate organization from the

254
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,810
 

255
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,880
 after plate I Triple E 802 but I think

256
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,880
 

257
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:06,330
 for conceptual purposes it's fine if to

258
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:06,330
 

259
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:09,270
 think of I Triple E 802 11 as Wi-Fi

260
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,270
 

261
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:12,030
 standards body for the past seven months

262
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,030
 

263
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:13,140
 or so I have also been following 3gpp

264
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,140
 

265
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:15,330
 which is the third generation

266
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:15,330
 

267
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:17,670
 partnership project it's like this big

268
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,670
 

269
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:18,840
 global organization of mobile network

270
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,840
 

271
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,790
 equipment manufacturers

272
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,790
 

273
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,130
 telecommunications operators and a few

274
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,130
 

275
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:25,350
 others including governments as we will

276
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,350
 

277
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:27,930
 see and they make mobile network

278
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,930
 

279
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:30,540
 standards they were originally formed to

280
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,540
 

281
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:32,490
 develop the 3g standard which or you

282
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,490
 

283
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:34,560
 know UMTS these kind of things that were

284
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,560
 

285
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:37,500
 deployed way back when now they also

286
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,500
 

287
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,970
 deal with 4G and 5g but they didn't

288
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:38,970
 

289
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:44,940
 update the name and so that's why it

290
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,940
 

291
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:46,410
 sound kind of a anachronistic but

292
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,410
 

293
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:49,290
 without we can move on to the good news

294
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,290
 

295
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:51,150
 slides I'll try not to speak too long

296
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,150
 

297
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:53,460
 there is actually been a number of good

298
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,460
 

299
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:55,080
 developments in the I Triple E 802 group

300
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,080
 

301
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:58,080
 from the time that I've monitored them

302
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:58,080
 

303
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,460
 in 2017 one of them is the dot eleven

304
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,460
 

305
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,810
 eight you previously enhancements

306
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,810
 

307
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,540
 amendments which deals with some

308
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,540
 

309
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:05,790
 geolocation or tracking issues that have

310
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,790
 

311
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:08,220
 been raised by researchers and privacy

312
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,220
 

313
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:11,790
 technologies for the past six or seven

314
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:11,790
 

315
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:14,700
 years it introduces MAC address pre

316
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,700
 

317
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:16,680
 Association randomization so basically

318
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,680
 

319
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:19,850
 when you're not what it says is that

320
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,850
 

321
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:22,290
 your mobile phone or connected equipment

322
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,290
 

323
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:23,240
 should randomized it's layer two

324
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,240
 

325
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,620
 identifier

326
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,620
 

327
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:28,460
 as long as you're not associated to the

328
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,460
 

329
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:31,220
 network it also fixes some other things

330
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:31,220
 

331
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:33,849
 like asks the chip and the management

332
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,849
 

333
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:36,740
 frame not to probe for specific SSIDs

334
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:36,740
 

335
00:07:33,849 --> 00:07:40,340
 reset sequence number counters to ensure

336
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:40,340
 

337
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:41,569
 that you can't track the equipment by

338
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,569
 

339
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,590
 ancillary attacks that have been

340
00:07:41,559 --> 00:07:42,590
 

341
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:45,289
 described in literature

342
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,289
 

343
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:46,940
 I mean basically it does a lot of the

344
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,940
 

345
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:49,069
 privacy enhancements amendments and dot

346
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,069
 

347
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:52,699
 11 aq which was already passed last year

348
00:07:49,059 --> 00:07:52,699
 

349
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:54,130
 in June introduces a lot of fixes the

350
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:54,130
 

351
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:57,550
 problems that have been raised

352
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,550
 

353
00:07:54,130 --> 00:08:00,050
 persistently by researchers since 2013

354
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,050
 

355
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:02,030
 this is a very positive development

356
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,030
 

357
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:04,039
 we now have a standard which describes

358
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,039
 

359
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:06,800
 how we could mitigate a lot of the

360
00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:06,800
 

361
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:08,539
 serious privacy concerns that previously

362
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,539
 

363
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,800
 have been kind of built in to the

364
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,800
 

365
00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:14,539
 technical architecture of our devices

366
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,539
 

367
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,400
 I've included on this slide a link to a

368
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:16,400
 

369
00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:18,949
 presentation made by one of my

370
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,949
 

371
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,490
 colleagues at 802 dot 11 which explains

372
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:22,490
 

373
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:24,319
 the general dot 11 AQ canny features in

374
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,319
 

375
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:25,849
 a more comprehensive format I realize

376
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:25,849
 

377
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,380
 you may not be able to copy it from the

378
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,380
 

379
00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:28,820
 screen but if you contact me afterwards

380
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,820
 

381
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:33,440
 I'll send you the link and I'm sure

382
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:33,440
 

383
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:35,570
 you'll find it all very interesting so

384
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,570
 

385
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,310
 other things that are going on with

386
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,310
 

387
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:40,370
 Wireless local area networks which are

388
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,370
 

389
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:41,779
 interesting is scalable geolocation this

390
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,779
 

391
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:43,909
 again comes into the tracking

392
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:43,909
 

393
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:46,339
 requirements but it's a very well

394
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:46,339
 

395
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:48,680
 studied problem and literature so it's

396
00:08:46,329 --> 00:08:48,680
 

397
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:50,329
 very for me heartening to see that

398
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,329
 

399
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,550
 privacy enhancing technologies research

400
00:08:50,319 --> 00:08:52,550
 

401
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:54,200
 is now being actually adopted by

402
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,200
 

403
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:56,420
 industry and their practical processes

404
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:56,420
 

405
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,430
 one of them is passive ranging or

406
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,430
 

407
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:01,550
 passive geo locations basically making

408
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:01,550
 

409
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:04,100
 the identity or location of a device in

410
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,100
 

411
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:06,200
 a network function kind of similarly to

412
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,200
 

413
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,850
 GPS so instead of the network figuring

414
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,850
 

415
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,529
 out where you are the network provides

416
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,529
 

417
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:13,550
 you with information to help you find

418
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,550
 

419
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:17,660
 yourself we had recently on the spring

420
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,660
 

421
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:19,399
 some advancements to modify management

422
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,399
 

423
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,560
 frames in such a way that it will be

424
00:09:19,389 --> 00:09:21,560
 

425
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:25,250
 easier for an end user device to

426
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:25,250
 

427
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,630
 indicate policy preferences this is also

428
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,630
 

429
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,730
 something that's been addressed in

430
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,730
 

431
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:29,959
 literature I know especially at INRIA in

432
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,959
 

433
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:31,730
 France

434
00:09:29,949 --> 00:09:31,730
 

435
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:34,430
 and I was very happy to see this being

436
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,430
 

437
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:36,200
 taken up by the group in in May although

438
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,200
 

439
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:37,970
 a word of caution

440
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:37,970
 

441
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,310
 is that it's not yet in the actual

442
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,310
 

443
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:42,560
 standards yes the proposal the amendment

444
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,560
 

445
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:44,690
 is not adopted

446
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,690
 

447
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,580
 of course when your market standards is

448
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,580
 

449
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,990
 such a low level you also need to take

450
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:47,990
 

451
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,030
 into account that there's a difference

452
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,030
 

453
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:53,660
 between a mechanism for expressing a

454
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:53,660
 

455
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:55,580
 policy and the policy as such so you can

456
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,580
 

457
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:57,920
 have an indication in a management frame

458
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:57,920
 

459
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:59,870
 that you have a specific policy

460
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,870
 

461
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,880
 preference but the I Triple E 8:02

462
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,880
 

463
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:04,940
 normally does not set for instance

464
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,940
 

465
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:08,270
 defaults default values or what should

466
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:08,270
 

467
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:10,310
 be how should this bit be set when it

468
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,310
 

469
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:11,870
 shipped to consumers so I will return to

470
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,870
 

471
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,970
 this and the third section of this talk

472
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,970
 

473
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:16,490
 because the fact that they define the

474
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,490
 

475
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:19,520
 mechanisms but the actual defaults are

476
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,520
 

477
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:20,990
 then left to other processes makes a big

478
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,990
 

479
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:26,060
 difference especially in the European

480
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:26,060
 

481
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:28,580
 regulatory framework so on to the bad

482
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:28,580
 

483
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:30,650
 news I will actually go back to a

484
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,650
 

485
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:33,590
 presentation made by a Nokia Belle ABS

486
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,590
 

487
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:35,930
 engineer last year at the Etsy security

488
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,930
 

489
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:37,400
 week it's an annual event organized by

490
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,400
 

491
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:39,560
 the European technical standards

492
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,560
 

493
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:42,560
 Institute which was formed in the 1980s

494
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,560
 

495
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:44,600
 and has some form of statutory base it's

496
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,600
 

497
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,250
 free to attend for anyone who can afford

498
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,250
 

499
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,220
 to go to the south of France for a week

500
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,220
 

501
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:50,960
 and chill out

502
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,960
 

503
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:52,940
 but this presentation I was there last

504
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,940
 

505
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,650
 year I saw this being presented live and

506
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,650
 

507
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,480
 it really alerted me to something being

508
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,480
 

509
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:59,390
 extremely wrong in mobile network

510
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:59,390
 

511
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,220
 standards organization so Nokia Bell

512
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,220
 

513
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:03,970
 Labs many of you will know was a really

514
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:03,970
 

515
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:07,250
 big company right Nokia is not a small

516
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,250
 

517
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:08,780
 institutional actor also Bell Labs I

518
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,780
 

519
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,670
 would not call one of these you know

520
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,670
 

521
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:15,740
 small and medium-sized enterprises that

522
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:15,740
 

523
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:17,570
 do not have any market leverage so what

524
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:17,570
 

525
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:20,990
 she appears to be describing here is

526
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,990
 

527
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:23,420
 that there are some reality of attacks

528
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,420
 

529
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:25,820
 against mobile networks which include

530
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,820
 

531
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:30,350
 intelligence communities military and

532
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:30,350
 

533
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:32,060
 law enforcement and they're stopping our

534
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,060
 

535
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:33,860
 companies from developing but their

536
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,860
 

537
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:35,750
 privacy and security mechanisms by

538
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,750
 

539
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,760
 showing up at the standards meetings and

540
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,760
 

541
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:39,650
 objecting to features that would

542
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,650
 

543
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,530
 otherwise protect us from being

544
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,530
 

545
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:44,720
 introduced now actually we have

546
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,720
 

547
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:46,520
 documented evidence now from brussels

548
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,520
 

549
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,380
 institutions that this is not just at

550
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,380
 

551
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,120
 the 3gpp that these law enforcement

552
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,120
 

553
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:52,130
 institutions show up

554
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,130
 

555
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,480
 well so the I should say also that the

556
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,480
 

557
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:56,360
 other significant thing about this

558
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,360
 

559
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,460
 though Nokia Belle abs being a big

560
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,460
 

561
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:01,130
 company if they are objecting to this

562
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:01,130
 

563
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:03,050
 then we know if we like privacy and

564
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,050
 

565
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:05,390
 security that we have some strong allies

566
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,390
 

567
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:07,280
 which aren't just this is not just an

568
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,280
 

569
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:09,560
 idealist ik interest these industries

570
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,560
 

571
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,880
 are trying to make security improvements

572
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,880
 

573
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:15,010
 but they are finding themselves

574
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:15,010
 

575
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:17,720
 challenged by the powers that be and

576
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,720
 

577
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:19,430
 they're also challenged at the Council

578
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,430
 

579
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,530
 of Ministers so this is the report that

580
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,530
 

581
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:24,800
 came from I think Europe all and euro

582
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,800
 

583
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:28,220
 just in May of 2019 where they are

584
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:28,220
 

585
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,710
 trying to take the endeavors of industry

586
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:30,710
 

587
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:32,570
 to improve privacy and security all the

588
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,570
 

589
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:34,580
 way up to the council of ministers of

590
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,580
 

591
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:36,620
 the European Union because they are

592
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,620
 

593
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:40,190
 finding industry endeavors to improve

594
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:40,190
 

595
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:42,590
 privacy and security bad and they wanted

596
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,590
 

597
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:45,500
 to be politically stopped because merely

598
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,500
 

599
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:47,030
 exercise saying resistance against such

600
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,030
 

601
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,730
 improvements in the standards

602
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,730
 

603
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:52,700
 organisations apparently was not good

604
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,700
 

605
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:55,550
 enough for them and so this is quite

606
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:55,550
 

607
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:58,400
 serious psyche Bazaar is struggle really

608
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:58,400
 

609
00:12:55,550 --> 00:13:01,640
 between European values and member state

610
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:01,640
 

611
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:03,290
 values it's as if our companies have

612
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,290
 

613
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,600
 been told by the data protection

614
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,600
 

615
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:07,490
 regulation for instance that you need to

616
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,490
 

617
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,260
 protect personal data and you need to

618
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,260
 

619
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:10,760
 have better data security or we will

620
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,760
 

621
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,950
 give you a four percent fine of your

622
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,950
 

623
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:15,710
 annual turnover for not doing your due

624
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,710
 

625
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:17,060
 diligence on the one hand but then on

626
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,060
 

627
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:18,770
 the other hand you get these weird

628
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,770
 

629
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:20,540
 political conflicts where public

630
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,540
 

631
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:22,130
 authorities make angry documents with

632
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,130
 

633
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:24,620
 politicians saying that our life is

634
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,620
 

635
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:26,360
 destroyed and terrorism will haven't

636
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:26,360
 

637
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:27,860
 happen if in every corner if these

638
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,860
 

639
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,430
 companies actually act on this

640
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,430
 

641
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:33,680
 legislative imperative that we gave them

642
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,680
 

643
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:35,960
 I interpret this to be a conflict

644
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,960
 

645
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,610
 between the slightly idealistic consumer

646
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,610
 

647
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:40,840
 trade in economics environment to

648
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,840
 

649
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:43,340
 Brussels pulling in one direction

650
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:43,340
 

651
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:45,470
 various member states with more sinister

652
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,470
 

653
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:47,930
 and national security and interests are

654
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,930
 

655
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:50,360
 pulling in another direction and our

656
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,360
 

657
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:52,190
 companies they're sort of stuck in

658
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,190
 

659
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:56,150
 between they're getting pushed in both

660
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:56,150
 

661
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:58,460
 directions at the same time there are

662
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,460
 

663
00:13:56,150 --> 00:14:00,140
 some weird consequences of this one of

664
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,140
 

665
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:02,180
 them is that end-to-end encryption is

666
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,180
 

667
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,680
 being blocked not just by conservative

668
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:03,680
 

669
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:05,570
 companies which can

670
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,570
 

671
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,430
 sometimes be reluctant to make changes

672
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,430
 

673
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:10,279
 in their architecture but it's also

674
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,279
 

675
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:12,470
 blocked by telcos who will frequently in

676
00:14:10,269 --> 00:14:12,470
 

677
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:14,029
 3gpp meetings raise objections like we

678
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,029
 

679
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:15,740
 cannot do that for lawful intercept

680
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,740
 

681
00:14:14,029 --> 00:14:17,720
 reasons we cannot do this we cannot do

682
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,720
 

683
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:20,810
 the other security improvement because

684
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:20,810
 

685
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,399
 if telcos do not say that governments

686
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,399
 

687
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:24,500
 can revoke their licenses and they can

688
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:24,500
 

689
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,170
 no longer operate on the market for many

690
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:27,170
 

691
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:29,240
 telcos that means real investment losses

692
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,240
 

693
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:30,830
 of billions of euros so they simply

694
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,830
 

695
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:34,940
 can't afford to stand up to the

696
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:34,940
 

697
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:36,860
 government's in these cases there's also

698
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,860
 

699
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:39,770
 some weird consequences of lawful

700
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,770
 

701
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:41,330
 intercept working group at 3gpp actively

702
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,330
 

703
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:45,170
 pushing companies to develop data

704
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,170
 

705
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:47,000
 maximization business models so that's a

706
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,000
 

707
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:49,190
 direct contradiction with European law

708
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,190
 

709
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,110
 actually because data minimization is

710
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,110
 

711
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:52,580
 one of the core principles of European

712
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,580
 

713
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:54,649
 data protection law and one of the

714
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:54,649
 

715
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:56,089
 things which if you do not implement you

716
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,089
 

717
00:14:54,649 --> 00:15:02,360
 can have a four percent annual turnover

718
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:02,360
 

719
00:14:56,089 --> 00:15:05,029
 fine I found this so this second point I

720
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:05,029
 

721
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,770
 should mention is also I only know of

722
00:15:05,019 --> 00:15:06,770
 

723
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:09,830
 this point because I was in a meeting

724
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,830
 

725
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:11,270
 where this was said so to my best of

726
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,270
 

727
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:13,370
 knowledge this isn't written down

728
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,370
 

729
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:15,380
 anywhere but it was a fascinating

730
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,380
 

731
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:17,029
 exchange between you know law

732
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,029
 

733
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:19,880
 enforcement going maybe you can tie to

734
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:19,880
 

735
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:24,709
 maximise an industry saying oh it's not

736
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:24,709
 

737
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:27,260
 really foreseen there's a third problem

738
00:15:24,699 --> 00:15:27,260
 

739
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:29,120
 which is that government authorities who

740
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,120
 

741
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:31,459
 participate in the 3gpp standards

742
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:31,459
 

743
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:36,020
 framework put forward proposals of

744
00:15:31,449 --> 00:15:36,020
 

745
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:38,660
 really dubious legal of legal dubious

746
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,660
 

747
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:40,580
 legality so one of the really good

748
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:40,580
 

749
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:44,630
 examples of this is a real-time access

750
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:44,630
 

751
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:47,630
 standard at CTS 102 six five seven which

752
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,630
 

753
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:50,150
 enables police forces to go in real time

754
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:50,150
 

755
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:52,040
 in a telecommunications operator network

756
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,040
 

757
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:55,700
 and access customer data without the

758
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:55,700
 

759
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:57,950
 telco knowing it was developed in 1997

760
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,950
 

761
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,690
 when in most European countries that

762
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,690
 

763
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:01,370
 kind of real-time access to data would

764
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,370
 

765
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:04,959
 not have been legal for law enforcement

766
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,959
 

767
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:08,540
 to do and I know at least in the Swedish

768
00:16:04,949 --> 00:16:08,540
 

769
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:10,399
 context we had huge discussions in 2012

770
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,399
 

771
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:13,279
 about whether this technology should be

772
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:13,279
 

773
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:16,160
 legalized because it exists so it's

774
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:16,160
 

775
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,390
 almost as if sometimes these government

776
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,390
 

777
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,240
 authorities the participe

778
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,240
 

779
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:22,310
 in 3gpp are using the platform as a

780
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,310
 

781
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,710
 reverse policy washing platform

782
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,710
 

783
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:26,300
 they create the technical requirement

784
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,300
 

785
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:28,070
 which isn't lawful in order to be able

786
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:28,070
 

787
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:31,580
 to go to legislators and ask them to

788
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:31,580
 

789
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:33,110
 make the bad technology lawful industry

790
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:33,110
 

791
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:35,600
 of course is put in a terrible position

792
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,600
 

793
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:39,050
 because of this I propose it's not

794
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:39,050
 

795
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,730
 useful yeah because they can't really

796
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,730
 

797
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:42,980
 object because they risk losing a lot of

798
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,980
 

799
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:45,650
 investments so they try to make all of

800
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:45,650
 

801
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:48,380
 these diplomatic assertions like oh it's

802
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,380
 

803
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:50,720
 not foreseen this is not great

804
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,720
 

805
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:52,550
 one big Mobile Equipment vendor last

806
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,550
 

807
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,010
 year released a security strategy in

808
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,010
 

809
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:56,840
 December where they committed to making

810
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,840
 

811
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:58,550
 end-to-end encryption available for

812
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,550
 

813
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:01,190
 Internet of Things devices because

814
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,190
 

815
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:02,540
 actually how else to secure them but

816
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,540
 

817
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:04,820
 they specifically do not make that

818
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,820
 

819
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:07,010
 commitment for n for end consumer

820
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:07,010
 

821
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:08,630
 communications and I believe it's

822
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,630
 

823
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:11,150
 exactly because they've been put under

824
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,150
 

825
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:14,209
 pressure not to not to advance such

826
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:14,209
 

827
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:16,070
 ideas but it also ironically means then

828
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,070
 

829
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:17,900
 that in their security strategy for the

830
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,900
 

831
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:20,810
 entire world and billions of people and

832
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,810
 

833
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:22,339
 devices this mobile equipment vendor is

834
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,339
 

835
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:26,110
 saying that they prioritize my

836
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:26,110
 

837
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:28,550
 toothbrush more than they prioritize me

838
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,550
 

839
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:30,650
 this is not a good thing this is not a

840
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,650
 

841
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:33,140
 good principle upon which society should

842
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,140
 

843
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:35,000
 be built and it's a terrible position

844
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:35,000
 

845
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:37,190
 actually for mobile network equipment

846
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:37,190
 

847
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,450
 vendors and operators they are trying to

848
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,450
 

849
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:43,850
 do the right thing they're just getting

850
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:43,850
 

851
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:45,380
 blocked from doing the right thing but

852
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,380
 

853
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:47,720
 enough about the problems in the world

854
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,720
 

855
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:51,620
 actually we'll come back to them at the

856
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:51,620
 

857
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:53,470
 later slide just kidding yeah I wanted

858
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,470
 

859
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:57,680
 to talk a bit about like optimistic

860
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:57,680
 

861
00:17:53,470 --> 00:18:03,830
 views on if we have good standards how

862
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:03,830
 

863
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:06,740
 do we get them deployed and so I was

864
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,740
 

865
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:08,750
 following for some time when working in

866
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:08,750
 

867
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:10,850
 Brussels website accessibility standards

868
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,850
 

869
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:12,650
 which some of you if you work with web

870
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,650
 

871
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:16,220
 front-end web development you'll know

872
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,220
 

873
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:18,470
 about wcag 2.0 which is a web

874
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:18,470
 

875
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,810
 accessibility standard it was developed

876
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,810
 

877
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:22,940
 like ages ago it's been around for 20

878
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,940
 

879
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:25,130
 years and so it could have been deployed

880
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:25,130
 

881
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:27,440
 by any public sector institution in the

882
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,440
 

883
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:29,669
 European Union for all the time but in

884
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,669
 

885
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,829
 practice it hardly ever was

886
00:18:29,659 --> 00:18:31,829
 

887
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:34,679
 so when instead happened was that the

888
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,679
 

889
00:18:31,829 --> 00:18:36,989
 European Commission launched a proposal

890
00:18:34,669 --> 00:18:36,989
 

891
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:39,679
 for a directive to mandate public sector

892
00:18:36,979 --> 00:18:39,679
 

893
00:18:36,989 --> 00:18:43,889
 institutions to have accessible websites

894
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:43,889
 

895
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:45,479
 it was passed in 2015 or 2016 and then

896
00:18:43,879 --> 00:18:45,479
 

897
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:47,759
 in order to implement the directive

898
00:18:45,469 --> 00:18:47,759
 

899
00:18:45,479 --> 00:18:49,739
 there needed to be a European harmonized

900
00:18:47,749 --> 00:18:49,739
 

901
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:52,829
 standard they call it which is developed

902
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:52,829
 

903
00:18:49,739 --> 00:18:54,649
 by a team so now the European

904
00:18:52,819 --> 00:18:54,649
 

905
00:18:52,829 --> 00:18:56,789
 institutions are in the process of

906
00:18:54,639 --> 00:18:56,789
 

907
00:18:54,649 --> 00:18:58,409
 assisting and the development of this

908
00:18:56,779 --> 00:18:58,409
 

909
00:18:56,789 --> 00:19:00,690
 harmonized standard which will

910
00:18:58,399 --> 00:19:00,690
 

911
00:18:58,409 --> 00:19:03,419
 eventually enable European public sector

912
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,419
 

913
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:04,739
 institutions to follow WCAG web

914
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:04,739
 

915
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:06,419
 accessibility standards

916
00:19:04,729 --> 00:19:06,419
 

917
00:19:04,739 --> 00:19:08,519
 I think this is a long and fairly

918
00:19:06,409 --> 00:19:08,519
 

919
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:10,169
 tedious process which to me is not the

920
00:19:08,509 --> 00:19:10,169
 

921
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:11,639
 best effective way for the European

922
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:11,639
 

923
00:19:10,169 --> 00:19:14,609
 institutions to make use of good

924
00:19:11,629 --> 00:19:14,609
 

925
00:19:11,639 --> 00:19:18,690
 industry developments so I want to

926
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:18,690
 

927
00:19:14,609 --> 00:19:20,579
 propose some other ways in relation

928
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,579
 

929
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:23,009
 actually to the wireless local area

930
00:19:20,569 --> 00:19:23,009
 

931
00:19:20,579 --> 00:19:26,279
 network privacy improvements that I

932
00:19:22,999 --> 00:19:26,279
 

933
00:19:23,009 --> 00:19:29,129
 talked about earlier so three different

934
00:19:26,269 --> 00:19:29,129
 

935
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:31,079
 options really for ensuring that we can

936
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:31,079
 

937
00:19:29,129 --> 00:19:33,539
 make the most use of industry actors

938
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:33,539
 

939
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:35,309
 doing not terrible things one of them is

940
00:19:33,529 --> 00:19:35,309
 

941
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,539
 the radio equipment directive some of

942
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,539
 

943
00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:38,219
 you will know about it because you've

944
00:19:36,529 --> 00:19:38,219
 

945
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:42,059
 been working with the Free Software

946
00:19:38,209 --> 00:19:42,059
 

947
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:44,549
 Foundation Europe on dynamic frequency

948
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:44,549
 

949
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:46,320
 selection but there's other parts of the

950
00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:46,320
 

951
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:50,789
 radio equipment directive - such as

952
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:50,789
 

953
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:52,320
 article 3 3e privacy requirements you

954
00:19:50,779 --> 00:19:52,320
 

955
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:54,209
 should be able to find it by googling

956
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,209
 

957
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:57,419
 for radio equipment directive and then

958
00:19:54,199 --> 00:19:57,419
 

959
00:19:54,209 --> 00:19:59,789
 locating article 3 3e so that would

960
00:19:57,409 --> 00:19:59,789
 

961
00:19:57,419 --> 00:20:02,309
 basically be an at-sea like process of

962
00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:02,309
 

963
00:19:59,789 --> 00:20:04,409
 being able to benefit from I Triple E

964
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:04,409
 

965
00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:05,639
 developments because you need to go

966
00:20:04,399 --> 00:20:05,639
 

967
00:20:04,409 --> 00:20:07,229
 through the entire process of a

968
00:20:05,629 --> 00:20:07,229
 

969
00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:08,999
 harmonized standard and I've just told

970
00:20:07,219 --> 00:20:08,999
 

971
00:20:07,229 --> 00:20:11,099
 you that a website accessibility that in

972
00:20:08,989 --> 00:20:11,099
 

973
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:12,839
 Burke very well so that's why I also

974
00:20:11,089 --> 00:20:12,839
 

975
00:20:11,099 --> 00:20:15,029
 have some other ideas about how we can

976
00:20:12,829 --> 00:20:15,029
 

977
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:17,339
 ensure that there is deployment of some

978
00:20:15,019 --> 00:20:17,339
 

979
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:19,259
 of these privacy features the first is

980
00:20:17,329 --> 00:20:19,259
 

981
00:20:17,339 --> 00:20:21,690
 the data protection regulation articles

982
00:20:19,249 --> 00:20:21,690
 

983
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:24,329
 40 or 42 because they deal with codes of

984
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,329
 

985
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:25,679
 conduct or certification in this case we

986
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:25,679
 

987
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:28,499
 would need to support our data

988
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:28,499
 

989
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:31,249
 protection regulatory bodies so doctor

990
00:20:28,489 --> 00:20:31,249
 

991
00:20:28,499 --> 00:20:33,749
 Tilson attend Denmark or Kiel and France

992
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:33,749
 

993
00:20:31,249 --> 00:20:35,039
 the darkness shoots I forget what

994
00:20:33,739 --> 00:20:35,039
 

995
00:20:33,749 --> 00:20:37,259
 they're called in Germany and so forth

996
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:37,259
 

997
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:39,659
 to interact with some of the industry

998
00:20:37,249 --> 00:20:39,659
 

999
00:20:37,259 --> 00:20:41,249
 institutions like Wi-Fi Alliance that

1000
00:20:39,649 --> 00:20:41,249
 

1001
00:20:39,659 --> 00:20:44,100
 actually sat down certification

1002
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:44,100
 

1003
00:20:41,249 --> 00:20:45,750
 requirements for Wi-Fi equipment

1004
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,750
 

1005
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:47,070
 this might be able to take the form of a

1006
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,070
 

1007
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:49,440
 code of conduct or a certification

1008
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,440
 

1009
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:52,230
 program but I'm pretty sure that if we

1010
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:52,230
 

1011
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:55,470
 can get if these previously enhancing

1012
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:55,470
 

1013
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:57,420
 features were to be considered data

1014
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,420
 

1015
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:59,460
 protection by design for instance that

1016
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:59,460
 

1017
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:01,170
 would be a strong incentive on industry

1018
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:01,170
 

1019
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:04,020
 to actually implement these features

1020
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,020
 

1021
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:06,180
 which are already standardized we can

1022
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,180
 

1023
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:08,520
 also support public procurements there's

1024
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:08,520
 

1025
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:11,460
 the Wi-Fi for EU programme which hands

1026
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:11,460
 

1027
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:13,800
 out money to municipalities so you could

1028
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,800
 

1029
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:15,660
 try to assist either the European

1030
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,660
 

1031
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,880
 Commission or municipalities that are

1032
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,880
 

1033
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:19,950
 trying to access this money in putting

1034
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,950
 

1035
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,660
 the right requirements and equipment so

1036
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,660
 

1037
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:23,610
 that they request features which are

1038
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,610
 

1039
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:27,120
 already under standard from the vendors

1040
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,120
 

1041
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:29,340
 that sell it I think both of the two

1042
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:29,340
 

1043
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,410
 latter points like either the gdpr or

1044
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,410
 

1045
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:33,090
 public procurements is a quicker way of

1046
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,090
 

1047
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:35,370
 me showing that we can benefit from

1048
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,370
 

1049
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:37,500
 privacy standards then the radio

1050
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,500
 

1051
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:38,760
 equipment directive would be but either

1052
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:38,760
 

1053
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,640
 of these three methods would be

1054
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,640
 

1055
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:43,350
 perfectly fine the only challenge for

1056
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,350
 

1057
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,600
 somebody who does not regularly work

1058
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,600
 

1059
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:47,550
 with regulatory authorities would be

1060
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,550
 

1061
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,100
 that it can be a bit messy to realize

1062
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,100
 

1063
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:52,410
 exactly how you get stuff moving in the

1064
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:52,410
 

1065
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:54,150
 implementation of law interacting with

1066
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,150
 

1067
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:55,440
 parliamentarians is easier because you

1068
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,440
 

1069
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:57,690
 just send them an email and then it's

1070
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,690
 

1071
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,820
 their problem regulatory authorities

1072
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,820
 

1073
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:02,240
 might request you to have technical

1074
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:02,240
 

1075
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:04,680
 knowledge or write reports and you know

1076
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,680
 

1077
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:09,450
 they also have larger requirements on

1078
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:09,450
 

1079
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:11,190
 their work in the 3gpp and mobile

1080
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,190
 

1081
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:12,900
 networks I think it's more a challenge

1082
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,900
 

1083
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:15,510
 of how do we ensure that European values

1084
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:15,510
 

1085
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:17,070
 prevail because as I described there's

1086
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,070
 

1087
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:20,340
 the struggle between the Member States

1088
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:20,340
 

1089
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:22,560
 and the European values and so how can

1090
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:22,560
 

1091
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:25,290
 you counterbalance that it's much more

1092
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:25,290
 

1093
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,670
 tricky because national security

1094
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,670
 

1095
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:28,530
 interests normally worked really

1096
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,530
 

1097
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:31,110
 long-term it's like this real-time

1098
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,110
 

1099
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:35,100
 access standard which they pass in 97

1100
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:35,100
 

1101
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:36,840
 only to make legislative proposals 15

1102
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:36,840
 

1103
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,850
 years later

1104
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,850
 

1105
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,160
 so whatever countering strategy you have

1106
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,160
 

1107
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:43,020
 for these public authorities that bully

1108
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:43,020
 

1109
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:45,120
 companies into not developing privacy

1110
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:45,120
 

1111
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:49,140
 and security it needs to probably be

1112
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:49,140
 

1113
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:52,070
 like long term one of the methods that I

1114
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:52,070
 

1115
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:54,300
 could spontaneously think of is again

1116
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,300
 

1117
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:57,420
 ensuring that there's counterbalancing

1118
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:57,420
 

1119
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,630
 representation in the 3gpp so NGOs can

1120
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:57,630
 

1121
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,940
 do

1122
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,940
 

1123
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:01,799
 like article 19 is doing of course it

1124
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:01,799
 

1125
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,309
 requires a lot of resources money and

1126
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:02,309
 

1127
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:04,799
 time

1128
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:04,799
 

1129
00:23:02,309 --> 00:23:07,440
 3gpp is full of big companies so they

1130
00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:07,440
 

1131
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:11,429
 organize meetings all the time one could

1132
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:11,429
 

1133
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:13,860
 spend one could not even be in enough

1134
00:23:11,419 --> 00:23:13,860
 

1135
00:23:11,429 --> 00:23:16,620
 meetings to cover the 3gpp as one person

1136
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,620
 

1137
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:19,350
 one would need at least three and so

1138
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:19,350
 

1139
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,450
 that's a challenge for NGOs another

1140
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,450
 

1141
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:23,160
 method of doing it is getting public

1142
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,160
 

1143
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:24,480
 authorities to start monitoring and

1144
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,480
 

1145
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,770
 counterbalancing other public

1146
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,770
 

1147
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,780
 authorities like data protection

1148
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,780
 

1149
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:30,080
 authorities have a real interest

1150
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:30,080
 

1151
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:32,130
 I believe in monitoring the 3gpp

1152
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:32,130
 

1153
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,679
 especially since we appear to be having

1154
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,679
 

1155
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:37,049
 public authorities actively encouraging

1156
00:23:34,669 --> 00:23:37,049
 

1157
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:39,210
 or even forcing companies to reflect on

1158
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,210
 

1159
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:41,100
 business models that technically are not

1160
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,100
 

1161
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:44,159
 in line with what the European law

1162
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:44,159
 

1163
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:45,809
 prescribes here again that's mostly a

1164
00:23:44,149 --> 00:23:45,809
 

1165
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,370
 question of being able to boost the

1166
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,370
 

1167
00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:49,200
 self-confidence of data protection

1168
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,200
 

1169
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:51,450
 authorities which in many European

1170
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:51,450
 

1171
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,210
 countries are full of lawyers lot of

1172
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,210
 

1173
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:57,150
 technical persons so there's a kind of

1174
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,150
 

1175
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:59,640
 knowledge gap to be divided to be

1176
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,640
 

1177
00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:02,610
 bridged in this case that knowledge

1178
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:02,610
 

1179
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:04,080
 divide where more people who work with

1180
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,080
 

1181
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:06,120
 the enforcement of privacy norms

1182
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:06,120
 

1183
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,890
 especially the European ones need to

1184
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,890
 

1185
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:10,650
 have the self confidence that they can

1186
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,650
 

1187
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:12,900
 actually usefully defend them also at

1188
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,900
 

1189
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:14,039
 the technical standards layers these are

1190
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,039
 

1191
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,780
 some of the things that I've been

1192
00:24:14,029 --> 00:24:15,780
 

1193
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:18,720
 working with article 19 to develop

1194
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:18,720
 

1195
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:21,539
 systematic approaches to but if one is

1196
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:21,539
 

1197
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,000
 interested in working on this as well or

1198
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:24,000
 

1199
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:25,590
 if you can provide technical feedback on

1200
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,590
 

1201
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,590
 the information that we're trying to

1202
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:28,590
 

1203
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:29,970
 compile please be please feel free to

1204
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,970
 

1205
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:34,909
 reach out to me and I can send you some

1206
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:34,909
 

1207
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:37,110
 documents over email and we can talk I

1208
00:24:34,899 --> 00:24:37,110
 

1209
00:24:34,909 --> 00:24:39,140
 think that's the last one on my science

1210
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,140
 

1211
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:44,370
 actually because I forgot to make the

1212
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:44,370
 

1213
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:45,600
 final slide but those were in the things

1214
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,600
 

1215
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:46,830
 that I wanted to propose and I want to

1216
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:46,830
 

1217
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,480
 thank you all for your attention and

1218
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,480
 

1219
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:51,090
 time and if you have any other questions

1220
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:51,090
 

1221
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,600
 you can speak with me after or even ask

1222
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,600
 

1223
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:53,600
 questions now

1224
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:54,090
 

1225
00:24:54,100 --> 00:25:04,299
[Applause]

1226
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:04,299
 

1227
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:04,299
 we do have time for questions

1228
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:09,360
 

1229
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:14,810
 I'm just thinking that the system of

1230
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,810
 

1231
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:17,150
 having standardization that is not like

1232
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,150
 

1233
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:19,250
 you don't need to follow it it's just

1234
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,250
 

1235
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:21,440
 bound to fail in some ways because

1236
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,440
 

1237
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:23,660
 what's the reason for a company choosing

1238
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:23,660
 

1239
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:28,130
 to follow a standard the standard is

1240
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:28,130
 

1241
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:33,890
 yeah because what do they have to lose

1242
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:33,890
 

1243
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:35,690
 if they don't follow it well so in

1244
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,690
 

1245
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:38,360
 Sweden for instance there is recently a

1246
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,360
 

1247
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:41,200
 proposal just at the end of May in 2019

1248
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:41,200
 

1249
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:43,790
 that the licenses which allow electronic

1250
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:43,790
 

1251
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,280
 communications operators to to even be

1252
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:46,280
 

1253
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:47,660
 companies and provide services would be

1254
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,660
 

1255
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,940
 subjected to the scrutiny of

1256
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:49,940
 

1257
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:53,930
 intelligence services and the security

1258
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:53,930
 

1259
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:55,840
 services so I think the data protection

1260
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,840
 

1261
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:58,580
 authorities in general do not have the

1262
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:58,580
 

1263
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:00,860
 competence to block companies from

1264
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:00,860
 

1265
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:04,520
 participating on a market but law

1266
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:04,520
 

1267
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:05,870
 enforcement and security services do so

1268
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,870
 

1269
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:08,750
 the companies have really strong

1270
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,750
 

1271
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:10,280
 incentives to follow the requirements of

1272
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,280
 

1273
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:13,460
 law of law enforcement and the

1274
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:13,460
 

1275
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:15,740
 disrespect I have an idea like a

1276
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:15,740
 

1277
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:19,850
 different kind of system because instead

1278
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:19,850
 

1279
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:22,640
 of like punishing companies in some way

1280
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,640
 

1281
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:26,870
 of not following like the idea

1282
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:26,870
 

1283
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:29,390
 idealistic behavior and the problem

1284
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:29,390
 

1285
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:31,040
 about that is that a somebody needs to

1286
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,040
 

1287
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:34,610
 find out that they're not following this

1288
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:34,610
 

1289
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:36,800
 as a behavior so they can just like a

1290
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,800
 

1291
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:39,470
 black box and they can just hide their

1292
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:39,470
 

1293
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:41,540
 behavior behind the facade of the

1294
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,540
 

1295
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:43,760
 company right so if you make the

1296
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:43,760
 

1297
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:46,940
 opposite make it the opposite way so you

1298
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:46,940
 

1299
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,410
 actually get support from the state like

1300
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:48,410
 

1301
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:51,140
 you get monetary support or something

1302
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,140
 

1303
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:52,820
 like that from being as you can prove

1304
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:52,820
 

1305
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:54,740
 yourself that you have a good behavior

1306
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:54,740
 

1307
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:56,150
 so you make a good proof and every every

1308
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:56,150
 

1309
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:58,520
 time we can make this proof that they

1310
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,520
 

1311
00:26:56,150 --> 00:27:00,830
 have some good behavior then you would

1312
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,830
 

1313
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:02,330
 have everybody would like run towards

1314
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,330
 

1315
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:05,000
 like oh yeah I can prove I'm the best

1316
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,000
 

1317
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:08,870
 and then you don't need to get this body

1318
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:08,870
 

1319
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,700
 that comes in and finds that the bad

1320
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,700
 

1321
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:15,020
 behavior all signed they can work like

1322
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:15,020
 

1323
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:16,610
 you can inverse the direction of it so I

1324
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,610
 

1325
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:18,170
 think like the general data protection

1326
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,170
 

1327
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:20,390
 regulation contains some of these

1328
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,390
 

1329
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:23,960
 mechanisms codes of conducts and certain

1330
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:23,960
 

1331
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:25,850
 occasions are really technically a part

1332
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,850
 

1333
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,650
 of the European legislature trying to

1334
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,650
 

1335
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:30,440
 say listen there are ways that you can

1336
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,440
 

1337
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:32,720
 actively demonstrate compliance and ways

1338
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:32,720
 

1339
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:36,260
 that we will accept so the legislature

1340
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:36,260
 

1341
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:38,660
 tries but then the question is can the

1342
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,660
 

1343
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:40,520
 can the regulatory bodies like the DPS

1344
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:40,520
 

1345
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:42,920
 also effectively work with these tools

1346
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,920
 

1347
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:44,960
 and I think at this particular time in

1348
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:44,960
 

1349
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:48,160
 Europe there's been no approved code of

1350
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:48,160
 

1351
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:50,750
 conduct under the GDP are the financial

1352
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:50,750
 

1353
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:52,610
 mechanism that would encourage companies

1354
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,610
 

1355
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:55,850
 to sign up to or create the code of

1356
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,850
 

1357
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:57,530
 conduct is a bit dubious so the economic

1358
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,530
 

1359
00:27:55,850 --> 00:28:00,170
 model for the companies isn't really

1360
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,170
 

1361
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:02,900
 there in the legislation updating the

1362
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,900
 

1363
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:09,320
 GDP are with in the near future I will

1364
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:09,320
 

1365
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:10,910
 not consider probably feasible and also

1366
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,910
 

1367
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,950
 it is more likely actually to do damage

1368
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,950
 

1369
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:16,100
 than to do good if you look at the e

1370
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:16,100
 

1371
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:17,600
 privacy regulation and all of the member

1372
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,600
 

1373
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,610
 states and companies that are now trying

1374
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:19,610
 

1375
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,110
 to get special exceptions for themselves

1376
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,110
 

1377
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:22,970
 but so there are some of those

1378
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,970
 

1379
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:25,940
 mechanisms that you could work with by

1380
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,940
 

1381
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:27,320
 supporting implementing bodies so rather

1382
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:27,320
 

1383
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:29,660
 than making it a political discussion

1384
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:29,660
 

1385
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:31,340
 you try to discuss with you know data

1386
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,340
 

1387
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:33,380
 protection authorities about how do we

1388
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:33,380
 

1389
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:35,360
 make the code of conduct codes of

1390
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,360
 

1391
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:38,080
 conduct work for us can we make

1392
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:38,080
 

1393
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:40,130
 certifications work in a good way or

1394
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:40,130
 

1395
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:43,040
 alternatively you could support public

1396
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,040
 

1397
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:44,530
 procurements so when a municipality is

1398
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,530
 

1399
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:47,840
 trying to set up a public Wi-Fi network

1400
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,840
 

1401
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:49,880
 that translates into the municipality

1402
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,880
 

1403
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,770
 wanting to give somebody money right so

1404
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,770
 

1405
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:56,080
 that's kind of a reward can you make

1406
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,080
 

1407
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:58,610
 that reward contingent on the supplier

1408
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:58,610
 

1409
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,410
 fulfilling some criteria which are

1410
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,410
 

1411
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:04,250
 standardized and possible and

1412
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:04,250
 

1413
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:05,780
 implementable by industry actors and in

1414
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,780
 

1415
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:07,910
 that case how do you reach out to the

1416
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:07,910
 

1417
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:09,530
 municipalities to tell them what the

1418
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,530
 

1419
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:11,090
 good security standards are I mean for

1420
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,090
 

1421
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:13,010
 Wi-Fi networks in particular there's a

1422
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,010
 

1423
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:15,410
 bunch of things that you could that

1424
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,410
 

1425
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:17,600
 municipalities normally do not do that

1426
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,600
 

1427
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:19,520
 they could using the captive portal

1428
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,520
 

1429
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,020
 standard from the IETF rather than

1430
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:21,020
 

1431
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,780
 trying to man in the middle attack their

1432
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:23,780
 

1433
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:25,100
 users for instance but I think in a lot

1434
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:25,100
 

1435
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:26,840
 of the cases when they make these

1436
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:26,840
 

1437
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:28,280
 procurements they're just not aware of

1438
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,280
 

1439
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,720
 the technical tools that are out there

1440
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,720
 

1441
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:33,500
 so they don't know what requirements to

1442
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:33,500
 

1443
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:34,260
 put and on the European laws not in all

1444
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:34,260
 

1445
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,900
 Member States

1446
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:36,900
 

1447
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:39,480
 some significant number of member states

1448
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:39,480
 

1449
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:41,910
 there's also this ridiculous issue that

1450
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:41,910
 

1451
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:44,670
 they can't make in the procurement

1452
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,670
 

1453
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:46,920
 requirements they can only refer to kind

1454
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,920
 

1455
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:51,450
 of formally adopted harmonized standards

1456
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:51,450
 

1457
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:53,580
 from Etsy not industry standards so one

1458
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,580
 

1459
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:55,350
 could also try to work with public

1460
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:55,350
 

1461
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,490
 sector institutions to see if there is a

1462
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,490
 

1463
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:59,700
 way that they could benefit from

1464
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,700
 

1465
00:29:56,490 --> 00:30:01,170
 industry industry results rather than

1466
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:01,170
 

1467
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:03,330
 just waiting for the European Commission

1468
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,330
 

1469
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:05,010
 to issue mandates under the radio

1470
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,010
 

1471
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:07,440
 equipment directive or whatever because

1472
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,440
 

1473
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:09,810
 that's just really time consuming and

1474
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,810
 

1475
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,700
 also not very cost-efficient so those

1476
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,700
 

1477
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:13,670
 are the thing those are the venues that

1478
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,670
 

1479
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,990
 I see for none of them are fairly easy

1480
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,990
 

1481
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:20,040
 but they're the intuitive venues that I

1482
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:20,040
 

1483
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:22,020
 see for getting for having this reward

1484
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:22,020
 

1485
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:24,110
 system and having some benefit from the

1486
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:24,110
 

1487
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:25,980
 privacy developments in standards bodies

1488
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,980
 

1489
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:31,560
 3gpp is just completely different

1490
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:31,560
 

1491
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:32,700
 because it's because they're it's

1492
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,700
 

1493
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,710
 actually about like a posting

1494
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:34,710
 

1495
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:37,350
 punishments yeah and so law enforcement

1496
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,350
 

1497
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:39,240
 is the more credible stick is

1498
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,240
 

1499
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:40,620
 essentially the problem so you need to

1500
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,620
 

1501
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,270
 make somebody else the more credible

1502
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:42,270
 

1503
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:44,640
 stick because I don't think otherwise

1504
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,640
 

1505
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:46,260
 you ordeal with this fact that member

1506
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,260
 

1507
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,720
 states are not actually contributing to

1508
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:48,720
 

1509
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:49,590
 the European legislative the

1510
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:49,590
 

1511
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,810
 implementation of the European

1512
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,810
 

1513
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:53,700
 legislative framework it's really

1514
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,700
 

1515
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:55,890
 catastrophic even if you were not a

1516
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:55,890
 

1517
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:57,330
 privacy friendly person or you may

1518
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,330
 

1519
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:59,790
 rights friendly person I would assume

1520
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,790
 

1521
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:02,610
 that you consider this a big problem

1522
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:02,610
 

1523
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:06,230
 because you cannot have a company stuck

1524
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,230
 

1525
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:06,230
 in the middle of opposing

1526
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:06,760
 

1527
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:12,120
 opposing political directions there's

1528
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:12,120
 

1529
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,040
 one thing that industry really doesn't

1530
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:14,040
 

1531
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:16,440
 like it's normally being tugged in

1532
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:16,440
 

1533
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:21,090
 opposite directions they want stability

1534
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:21,090
 

1535
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:22,800
 and foreseeability I of course will

1536
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,800
 

1537
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:26,070
 prefer if they ended up to the right of

1538
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:26,070
 

1539
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:28,710
 my slides with data protection and the

1540
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,710
 

1541
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:30,570
 European Union but another way to get

1542
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,570
 

1543
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:32,040
 foreseeability for industry is to simply

1544
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,040
 

1545
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:33,510
 go in the other direction and say we'll

1546
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,510
 

1547
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,770
 do whatever the member states say and

1548
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,770
 

1549
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:36,660
 whatever is required for national

1550
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,660
 

1551
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:41,360
 security and that's a more like a macro

1552
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:41,360
 

1553
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:41,360
 political conflict I guess

1554
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:44,590
 

1555
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:53,650
 do we have any more questions no then

1556
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,650
 

1557
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:57,949
 let's give a big applause

1558
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:57,949
 

1559
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:57,949
[Applause]
