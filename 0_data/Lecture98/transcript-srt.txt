83
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:26,779
 you for coming out so early in the

84
00:06:23,109 --> 00:06:26,779
 

85
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:29,509
 morning I want to talk about what is

86
00:06:26,769 --> 00:06:29,509
 

87
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:32,629
 happening as machine learning meets

88
00:06:29,499 --> 00:06:32,629
 

89
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:36,169
 public policy now this is a meeting that

90
00:06:32,619 --> 00:06:36,169
 

91
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:41,419
 is sometimes awkward but some awkward

92
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:41,419
 

93
00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:44,389
 meetings are just meant to be sometimes

94
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:44,389
 

95
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:46,789
 it seems like our world the world of the

96
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:46,789
 

97
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:49,849
 research lab or the developer or data

98
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:49,849
 

99
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:52,489
 scientist cubicle is a million miles

100
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:52,489
 

101
00:06:49,849 --> 00:06:54,679
 from the world of public policy but I'm

102
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,679
 

103
00:06:52,489 --> 00:06:58,099
 going to argue today that it's up to us

104
00:06:54,669 --> 00:06:58,099
 

105
00:06:54,679 --> 00:07:01,279
 to close that gap that we have not only

106
00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:01,279
 

107
00:06:58,099 --> 00:07:03,789
 an opportunity but also a duty to be

108
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:03,789
 

109
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:08,029
 more active and more constructive in

110
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:08,029
 

111
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:11,809
 participating in public life so why is

112
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:11,809
 

113
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:13,759
 that well for one thing there are lots

114
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:13,759
 

115
00:07:11,809 --> 00:07:16,369
 of people saying that AI or machine

116
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:16,369
 

117
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,349
 learning should be regulated some of

118
00:07:16,359 --> 00:07:18,349
 

119
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:21,709
 them are even technical experts or at

120
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:21,709
 

121
00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:24,860
 least are seen by the public as such now

122
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:24,860
 

123
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:27,289
 we might think that he's wrong but

124
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:27,289
 

125
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:29,479
 notice that this piece ran in the hill

126
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,479
 

127
00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:32,779
 which is a publication that's read by

128
00:07:29,469 --> 00:07:32,779
 

129
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:34,819
 Washington Policy insiders this is what

130
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:34,819
 

131
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:36,589
 people in the public policy world are

132
00:07:34,809 --> 00:07:36,589
 

133
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:38,629
 hearing and they're not only hearing it

134
00:07:36,579 --> 00:07:38,629
 

135
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:40,639
 from people who come out of a tech out

136
00:07:38,619 --> 00:07:40,639
 

137
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:42,289
 of the tech industry they're hearing it

138
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:42,289
 

139
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,509
 from people who have spent a long time

140
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:44,509
 

141
00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:47,839
 in their communities such as Henry

142
00:07:44,499 --> 00:07:47,839
 

143
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:49,339
 Kissinger how the Enlightenment ends how

144
00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:49,339
 

145
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:53,299
 the Enlightenment ends according to

146
00:07:49,329 --> 00:07:53,299
 

147
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:57,139
 Henry Kissinger is you and us and if

148
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:57,139
 

149
00:07:53,299 --> 00:07:59,360
 that doesn't cause us to wake up and

150
00:07:57,129 --> 00:07:59,360
 

151
00:07:57,139 --> 00:08:00,469
 wonder why he thinks that and what we

152
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,469
 

153
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,509
 can do about it

154
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:02,509
 

155
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:05,839
 then I think we're really just not

156
00:08:02,499 --> 00:08:05,839
 

157
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:07,849
 paying attention just this past Saturday

158
00:08:05,829 --> 00:08:07,849
 

159
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:10,429
 The Wall Street Journal ran a piece

160
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:10,429
 

161
00:08:07,849 --> 00:08:13,339
 where experts debated whether and how to

162
00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:13,339
 

163
00:08:10,429 --> 00:08:16,849
 regulate AI the experts took different

164
00:08:13,329 --> 00:08:16,849
 

165
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:18,049
 views but one of them Ryan Kahlo a law

166
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:18,049
 

167
00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:21,019
 professor at the University of

168
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:21,019
 

169
00:08:18,049 --> 00:08:23,089
 Washington said something that helps us

170
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:23,089
 

171
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:25,819
 perhaps understand where the call for

172
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:25,819
 

173
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:28,219
 regulation is coming from here's what he

174
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:28,219
 

175
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:30,150
 said he said one of the ironies of AI is

176
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:30,150
 

177
00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:32,910
 that proponents often make too

178
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,910
 

179
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:35,670
 contradictory claims they say that AI is

180
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,670
 

181
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:37,590
 going to change everything but that

182
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,590
 

183
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:39,570
 there should be no changes to law or

184
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,570
 

185
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:43,890
 legal institutions in response and that

186
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,890
 

187
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:46,200
 doesn't make sense he says so why does

188
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,200
 

189
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:48,600
 he consider this a contradiction because

190
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,600
 

191
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,360
 law and policy are meant to change to

192
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:51,360
 

193
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,220
 adapt to conditions laws and policies

194
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,220
 

195
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,050
 are not written once and for all to

196
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:55,050
 

197
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,840
 handle all cases that might ever come up

198
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,840
 

199
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:59,700
 the the law and policy is meant to be a

200
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,700
 

201
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:03,000
 living system that adapts to what's

202
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:03,000
 

203
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,760
 going on in society and if we say that

204
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,760
 

205
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,110
 our work is going to change everything

206
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,110
 

207
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,650
 even if we think that changes for the

208
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:07,650
 

209
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:10,140
 better

210
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,140
 

211
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:12,720
 then we need to expect that law and

212
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:12,720
 

213
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:14,880
 policy will also change and people in

214
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,880
 

215
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,930
 our community are saying that we're

216
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:15,930
 

217
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,050
 going to change everything

218
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,050
 

219
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:20,970
 here's sundar Pichai the CEO of Google

220
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,970
 

221
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:23,040
 saying a is the most important thing

222
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,040
 

223
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:26,580
 humanity has ever worked on he ranks it

224
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:26,580
 

225
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,860
 above electricity and fire now I

226
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,860
 

227
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:32,400
 wouldn't go that far

228
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:32,400
 

229
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:34,800
 but nonetheless it is true that what's

230
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,800
 

231
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:37,980
 happening in machine learning is

232
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,980
 

233
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:41,130
 extremely powerful and represents

234
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:41,130
 

235
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:42,840
 potentially a profound change that will

236
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,840
 

237
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:47,250
 happen across many different areas of

238
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:47,250
 

239
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:49,890
 life and so it's natural that the public

240
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,890
 

241
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:52,590
 policy community and the law is going to

242
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,590
 

243
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:54,830
 take notice and is going to want to

244
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,830
 

245
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:57,030
 change and adapt to what we are doing

246
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,030
 

247
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:59,940
 but that's just a prediction of what

248
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,940
 

249
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:02,880
 will happen I'm going to go beyond that

250
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,880
 

251
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:05,310
 and say that society should respond to

252
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,310
 

253
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,770
 the changes that we're causing because

254
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,770
 

255
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:10,020
 that's only fair after all the people

256
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,020
 

257
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:12,600
 who are affected by the change that we

258
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,600
 

259
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:15,750
 are going to cause deserve some say in

260
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:15,750
 

261
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,340
 how that change happens if we believe in

262
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,340
 

263
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:19,530
 a society that's fundamentally

264
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,530
 

265
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:23,250
 democratic in which everyone has a stake

266
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,250
 

267
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:25,920
 and everyone has a voice then it's only

268
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,920
 

269
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:28,830
 fair that those whose lives we are going

270
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,830
 

271
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,960
 to change should have some say in how

272
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,960
 

273
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:32,730
 that change comes about and in which

274
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,730
 

275
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,460
 kinds of changes are going to happen in

276
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,460
 

277
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:37,500
 which or not and so decisions are going

278
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,500
 

279
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:39,390
 to be made decisions about how the

280
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:39,390
 

281
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,400
 systems that we build are going to

282
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,400
 

283
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:43,500
 evolve and how they're going to be used

284
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,500
 

285
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,950
 the question is not whether these

286
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:43,950
 

287
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,380
 decision

288
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,380
 

289
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:49,800
 we'll be made the question is what is

290
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:49,800
 

291
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:51,360
 our role in the decisions how should we

292
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,360
 

293
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,660
 try to affect them how should we

294
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,660
 

295
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,160
 participate so these decisions will

296
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,160
 

297
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,570
 happen the only question is what are we

298
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,570
 

299
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:03,750
 going to do I want to talk today about

300
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:03,750
 

301
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:06,410
 what our role should be but first we

302
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,410
 

303
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:09,210
 need to dispose with three possible

304
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,210
 

305
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:11,880
 approaches to this which are sometimes

306
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,880
 

307
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:14,480
 popular but are ultimately not viable

308
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,480
 

309
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:18,770
 and in fact ultimately counterproductive

310
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:18,770
 

311
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:22,110
 the first approach that is not viable is

312
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,110
 

313
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:24,230
 simply to appoint ourselves as gods we

314
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,230
 

315
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:26,520
 are going to decide how things will be

316
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,520
 

317
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:29,670
 everyone else will have to live with it

318
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:29,670
 

319
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:31,500
 don't worry we have your best interests

320
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,500
 

321
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:34,560
 at heart but we're fundamentally going

322
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,560
 

323
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:37,740
 to decide it for you now that's not

324
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:37,740
 

325
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:41,190
 going to fly if we try to do this we're

326
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,190
 

327
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:43,350
 going to fail and we deserve to fail if

328
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,350
 

329
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:45,240
 that's the approach we take because

330
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,240
 

331
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:47,970
 there are many perspectives many

332
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,970
 

333
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:50,700
 interests many very legitimate goals

334
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,700
 

335
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:53,420
 that our society and the people in it

336
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:53,420
 

337
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:56,040
 have which we may not see clearly

338
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:56,040
 

339
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:58,530
 although we know many things we do we

340
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,530
 

341
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,540
 know far from everything that we need to

342
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,540
 

343
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:03,270
 that is needed in order to make the

344
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:03,270
 

345
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:06,030
 wisest decisions in this area and so if

346
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:06,030
 

347
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:09,120
 we try this we will fail and that will

348
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:09,120
 

349
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:13,130
 in fact be a good thing the second bad

350
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:13,130
 

351
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:16,920
 approach which I want to warn against is

352
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,920
 

353
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:18,600
 is simply withdrawing to withdraw to our

354
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,600
 

355
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,910
 basements write some code and just

356
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,910
 

357
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,980
 ignore what's happening in the rest of

358
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,980
 

359
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:25,110
 society that's not going to lead to good

360
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,110
 

361
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:27,330
 decisions either and it ignores our

362
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,330
 

363
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:29,580
 responsibility to participate in solving

364
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,580
 

365
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:31,230
 society's problems if we really do

366
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,230
 

367
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:35,160
 believe that we have something to offer

368
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:35,160
 

369
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:38,100
 that we bring not the whole solution but

370
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:38,100
 

371
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:41,850
 one component of the solution to some of

372
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,850
 

373
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:43,800
 society's most serious problems then it

374
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,800
 

375
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:46,170
 would be irresponsible of us to simply

376
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:46,170
 

377
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:49,040
 withdraw go back to our labs and not try

378
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,040
 

379
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:51,060
 to change the world in in important ways

380
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,060
 

381
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,770
 because the insights and the

382
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,770
 

383
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:55,530
 technologies that we're developing do

384
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,530
 

385
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:57,520
 have a role to play and the third

386
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,520
 

387
00:12:55,530 --> 00:13:01,390
 approach I want to warn against

388
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:01,390
 

389
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:04,420
 is the idea that all this is just a PR

390
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,420
 

391
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:07,600
 problem that all we need to do is hire

392
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:07,600
 

393
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:10,420
 some fancy talker in a fancy suit and

394
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,420
 

395
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,190
 mate to make it all go away that might

396
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,190
 

397
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:15,750
 work in the short run but in the long

398
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,750
 

399
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:18,610
 run society will not be fooled that

400
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:18,610
 

401
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:20,530
 excuses are not going to cut it we need

402
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,530
 

403
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:23,290
 to actually engage in a serious

404
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,290
 

405
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:25,840
 conversation with the rest of society a

406
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,840
 

407
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:28,270
 conversation that takes their interest

408
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:28,270
 

409
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:30,190
 very seriously and takes all points of

410
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,190
 

411
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:33,670
 view very seriously we can't just talk

412
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:33,670
 

413
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:35,680
 this away because we do have something

414
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,680
 

415
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:38,620
 really important to contribute to that

416
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:38,620
 

417
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,630
 debate okay so what will work what is

418
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,630
 

419
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,880
 our role ultimately we're going to have

420
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,880
 

421
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:44,710
 to work with those who are making

422
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,710
 

423
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,990
 important decisions and that means

424
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,990
 

425
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:49,600
 working with decision makers so how are

426
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,600
 

427
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:53,380
 we going to do that so here's an expert

428
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:53,380
 

429
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:55,360
 and a decision maker how should they

430
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,360
 

431
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:57,880
 work together most importantly what

432
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,880
 

433
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,440
 should the expert do I have a certain

434
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,440
 

435
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,510
 amount of experience in doing this as

436
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:01,510
 

437
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,790
 Hannah mentioned I served as an adviser

438
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,790
 

439
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:06,640
 to President Obama on some of these

440
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:06,640
 

441
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:09,670
 issues and so I'm speaking here from

442
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:09,670
 

443
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:12,730
 experience that this work of working

444
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,730
 

445
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:14,260
 with decision makers is difficult but it

446
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,260
 

447
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:16,990
 can be done and you can really make

448
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,990
 

449
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:20,800
 progress in driving forward the debate

450
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,800
 

451
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:22,630
 and bringing and helping to foster a

452
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,630
 

453
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:27,010
 debate that's grounded in technical

454
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:27,010
 

455
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:28,510
 reality okay so how should an expert and

456
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,510
 

457
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:31,470
 decision maker work together it's not

458
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,470
 

459
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:35,500
 always easy we kind of like to have this

460
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:35,500
 

461
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:38,350
 this idealistic view in which the expert

462
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:38,350
 

463
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:40,570
 has access to truth the expert imparts

464
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,570
 

465
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:43,360
 truth to the decision maker and the

466
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,360
 

467
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:45,430
 decision maker makes a good decision and

468
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,430
 

469
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,760
 in the best of cases this is how it

470
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:45,760
 

471
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:49,660
 works

472
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:49,660
 

473
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:51,790
 but life is complicated and political

474
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,790
 

475
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:54,370
 decision-making is also a difficult

476
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,370
 

477
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:56,740
 situation too often it feels something

478
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,740
 

479
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:58,540
 like we have something like this we have

480
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,540
 

481
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:01,090
 some sort of pseudo expert or we have

482
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,090
 

483
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:03,190
 someone with an interest with an obvious

484
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,190
 

485
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:06,940
 interest at stake who is trying to push

486
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:06,940
 

487
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:09,410
 the conversation so how can we operate

488
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:09,410
 

489
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:11,810
 in a world where

490
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,810
 

491
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:13,870
 truth is not the ultimate trump card how

492
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,870
 

493
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:16,930
 can we participate in this conversation

494
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,930
 

495
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:19,940
 well the first part is to recognize that

496
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,940
 

497
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:21,860
 the conversation that we are entering is

498
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,860
 

499
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:25,670
 not the same kind of conversation that

500
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:25,670
 

501
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:27,560
 we have among ourselves when we are at

502
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,560
 

503
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:30,529
 an event like this when we're gathered

504
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:30,529
 

505
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,970
 around a whiteboard or in in a meeting

506
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:31,970
 

507
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:34,550
 room with our colleagues trying to

508
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,550
 

509
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:36,649
 figure something out at our best we're

510
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,649
 

511
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:39,350
 engaged in a search for truth to try to

512
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,350
 

513
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:41,449
 understand what is true about the world

514
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,449
 

515
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:44,120
 or what is true about some algorithm or

516
00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:44,120
 

517
00:15:41,449 --> 00:15:48,980
 system but politics is not a search for

518
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:48,980
 

519
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:51,170
 truth now you might think this is

520
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:51,170
 

521
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:53,689
 disappointing but in some important

522
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,689
 

523
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:55,970
 respects the fact that politics is not a

524
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:55,970
 

525
00:15:53,689 --> 00:15:58,990
 search for truth can be a feature and

526
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,990
 

527
00:15:55,970 --> 00:16:02,329
 not a bug why is that well fundamentally

528
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,329
 

529
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:04,579
 democracy is not a search for truth what

530
00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:04,579
 

531
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:06,379
 it is is something else

532
00:16:04,569 --> 00:16:06,379
 

533
00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:09,470
 but something very useful it's an

534
00:16:06,369 --> 00:16:09,470
 

535
00:16:06,379 --> 00:16:12,379
 algorithm for resolving disagreements if

536
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:12,379
 

537
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:14,569
 we disagree about what should happen and

538
00:16:12,369 --> 00:16:14,569
 

539
00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:16,579
 yet we need to decide we need some way

540
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:16,579
 

541
00:16:14,569 --> 00:16:19,910
 of deciding this and we can sit around

542
00:16:16,569 --> 00:16:19,910
 

543
00:16:16,579 --> 00:16:21,649
 and talk until we have persuaded every

544
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,649
 

545
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:25,910
 last person that our point of view is

546
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:25,910
 

547
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:28,370
 correct or we can engage in a slightly

548
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,370
 

549
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:29,860
 Messier process but one that is more

550
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,860
 

551
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:33,860
 likely to get to a decision

552
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:33,860
 

553
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:35,899
 the real advantage of democracy as an

554
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,899
 

555
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:38,449
 algorithm for resolving disagreements is

556
00:16:35,889 --> 00:16:38,449
 

557
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:40,550
 that no decision is undecidable no

558
00:16:38,439 --> 00:16:40,550
 

559
00:16:38,449 --> 00:16:42,410
 question is undecidable no matter how

560
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,410
 

561
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:44,779
 complex no matter how difficult a

562
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,779
 

563
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:46,490
 question is no matter how much evidence

564
00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:46,490
 

565
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:47,480
 that you might hope to have to make the

566
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,480
 

567
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:49,579
 decision is lacking

568
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:49,579
 

569
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,290
 you can always decide the question in

570
00:16:49,569 --> 00:16:51,290
 

571
00:16:49,579 --> 00:16:53,689
 fact all questions are decidable in

572
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,689
 

573
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:57,800
 constant time and that's actually pretty

574
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,800
 

575
00:16:53,689 --> 00:17:00,410
 good we can get to a decision even if we

576
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:00,410
 

577
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,120
 don't agree on the underlying facts we

578
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,120
 

579
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:03,949
 don't necessarily we can get to a

580
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,949
 

581
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,980
 decision even if we don't agree on the

582
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,980
 

583
00:17:03,949 --> 00:17:09,169
 underlying facts we might each have our

584
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:09,169
 

585
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:11,150
 own view about what the underlying facts

586
00:17:09,159 --> 00:17:11,150
 

587
00:17:09,169 --> 00:17:12,919
 are but if we could agree on what course

588
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,919
 

589
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:15,350
 of action should be taken or we can

590
00:17:12,909 --> 00:17:15,350
 

591
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:16,850
 reach some kind of consensus on that we

592
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,850
 

593
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:19,669
 might continue to disagree about

594
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,669
 

595
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:22,230
 underlying facts we can also decide

596
00:17:19,659 --> 00:17:22,230
 

597
00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:24,390
 using this algorithm without having us

598
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,390
 

599
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:26,250
 single coherent explanation for the

600
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,250
 

601
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:28,650
 decision which everyone agrees to I

602
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,650
 

603
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:30,570
 might want to do something for reason a

604
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,570
 

605
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:32,730
 you might want to do the same thing for

606
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,730
 

607
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:35,040
 reason B that's fine we can agree on the

608
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,040
 

609
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:37,410
 action we don't need to come to an

610
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,410
 

611
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:40,350
 agreement on the explanation for why

612
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,350
 

613
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:43,200
 we're taking that action and although it

614
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:43,200
 

615
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:46,380
 would be awesome to agree on all truth

616
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:46,380
 

617
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,299
 and to agree on all reasons in practice

618
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:48,299
 

619
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:50,280
 when we need to make a decision there's

620
00:17:48,289 --> 00:17:50,280
 

621
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:51,660
 a real benefit to having an algorithm

622
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,660
 

623
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,760
 that can reach a decision without

624
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,760
 

625
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:56,970
 needing to agree on anything besides

626
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,970
 

627
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,620
 what the decision is and so this is not

628
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,620
 

629
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:00,360
 although it's sometimes frustrating

630
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,360
 

631
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:02,990
 although we sometimes don't like the

632
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,990
 

633
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:08,340
 answer this is not a fundamentally

634
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:08,340
 

635
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:10,230
 stupid algorithm and yet often when we

636
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:10,230
 

637
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:12,990
 deal with individual decision makers say

638
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,990
 

639
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:14,790
 individual legislature legislators they

640
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,790
 

641
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:17,280
 seem to behave in a way that's logically

642
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,280
 

643
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:21,919
 inconsistent and they seem to behave in

644
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:21,919
 

645
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:25,830
 a way that is indifferent to truth but

646
00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:25,830
 

647
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:27,809
 even though this is the case it's not

648
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,809
 

649
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:30,030
 that this doesn't necessarily imply that

650
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:30,030
 

651
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:32,070
 they don't know what they're doing it

652
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,070
 

653
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:35,100
 doesn't necessarily imply that they are

654
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,100
 

655
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:38,010
 stupid or corrupt although let's face it

656
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:38,010
 

657
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:40,130
 a few of them are the fact that

658
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,130
 

659
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:42,870
 politicians behave in this way actually

660
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,870
 

661
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:45,320
 reflects some deep truths about the way

662
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,320
 

663
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:48,020
 the dynamics of this system operate

664
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:48,020
 

665
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:52,470
 politicians behave that way for a reason

666
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:52,470
 

667
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:55,530
 now I want to explain to this audience

668
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:55,530
 

669
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:57,210
 why that might be the case and so I'm

670
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,210
 

671
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:59,220
 going to do that by speaking a language

672
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,220
 

673
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:02,100
 that I hope will resonate with this

674
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:02,100
 

675
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:04,290
 audience namely a mathematical model so

676
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:04,290
 

677
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:07,290
 consider the following mathematical

678
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,290
 

679
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:10,020
 model of political decision-making will

680
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,020
 

681
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:12,240
 define some universe P of proposals

682
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:12,240
 

683
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:15,480
 these are things that we might decide to

684
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:15,480
 

685
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:18,240
 do and we'll label the individual

686
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:18,240
 

687
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:20,309
 proposals p0 up through what however

688
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,309
 

689
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,380
 many you like to have and to make the

690
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:22,380
 

691
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:24,600
 model simpler will assume that the

692
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,600
 

693
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:27,120
 proposals are independent meaning that

694
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:27,120
 

695
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:29,010
 our ability to implement one proposal

696
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,010
 

697
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,570
 and the effects of that proposal are

698
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,570
 

699
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:32,400
 independent of whether we've done any

700
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,400
 

701
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:34,290
 other proposal that's not how things

702
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,290
 

703
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,000
 work in real life but hey it's a model

704
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,000
 

705
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:37,590
 and all models are wrong but

706
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,590
 

707
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,660
 some models are useful and I think this

708
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,660
 

709
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,710
 one I hope will be useful okay so we're

710
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:40,710
 

711
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,420
 going to assume there's a set of

712
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,420
 

713
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:45,270
 proposals and that they're independent

714
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:45,270
 

715
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:47,160
 and we'll we'll say that a bill that is

716
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,160
 

717
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:49,980
 a thing that's proposed in our modeled

718
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:49,980
 

719
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:52,580
 legislature is a subset of P it's a set

720
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:52,580
 

721
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:55,260
 of proposals that are bundled together

722
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:55,260
 

723
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:57,360
 all right now we'll assume that every

724
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,360
 

725
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:59,310
 voter the voter I has a utility function

726
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,310
 

727
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,010
 that they can apply to an individual

728
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,010
 

729
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:04,380
 bill or proposal and we'll say that a

730
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,380
 

731
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:08,270
 voter supports a proposal if their

732
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:08,270
 

733
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:11,130
 utility for that proposal is positive

734
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,130
 

735
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:14,460
 and then we'll define that the the

736
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,460
 

737
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:16,890
 fundamental rule of voting that will say

738
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,890
 

739
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:20,550
 that a proposal passes if a majority of

740
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,550
 

741
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:23,640
 voters support it okay and further will

742
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:23,640
 

743
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:26,790
 assume that voters utility functions are

744
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:26,790
 

745
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:29,010
 reasonably consistent in a sense that

746
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:29,010
 

747
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:30,930
 they're additive that given two disjoint

748
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,930
 

749
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:33,900
 bills that is two bills that have no

750
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,900
 

751
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:36,420
 proposals in common that the voters

752
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:36,420
 

753
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:38,670
 utility for those bills put together is

754
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,670
 

755
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:40,620
 just the sum of their utility for the

756
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,620
 

757
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:42,600
 individual bills so when you combine

758
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:42,600
 

759
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:44,370
 proposals and remember proposals are

760
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,370
 

761
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,680
 assumed to be independent that the

762
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,680
 

763
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:48,090
 utilities just combine additively so

764
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,090
 

765
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:50,550
 that's a reasonable assumption to make

766
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,550
 

767
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:52,530
 about voter behavior and that is a nice

768
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,530
 

769
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:55,200
 corollary the corollary is this that

770
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,200
 

771
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:58,950
 given two disjoint bills B 1 and B 2

772
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:58,950
 

773
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:01,020
 that if a voter supports B 1 and a voter

774
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,020
 

775
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:02,580
 supports B 2 then that voter will

776
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,580
 

777
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:05,460
 support the combination of those two

778
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:05,460
 

779
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:09,690
 things so in this sense voters views are

780
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:09,690
 

781
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:11,760
 logically consistent right so that's

782
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,760
 

783
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:13,410
 true of individual voters and now we can

784
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,410
 

785
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,710
 construct this theorem that says given

786
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,710
 

787
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:20,070
 two disjoint bills B 1 and B 2 that if

788
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:20,070
 

789
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:22,350
 b1 passes with a majority and b2 passes

790
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,350
 

791
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:24,390
 with a majority then the combination

792
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,390
 

793
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:26,640
 will also pass with the majority and

794
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,640
 

795
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:29,400
 that is an awfully nice theorem except

796
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:29,400
 

797
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:32,790
 that it's not actually a theorem that's

798
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:32,790
 

799
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:34,980
 not true here's a counter example here

800
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,980
 

801
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:38,190
 we have two bills b1 and b2 and three

802
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:38,190
 

803
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:42,120
 voters Alice Bob and Charlie Alice likes

804
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:42,120
 

805
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:44,220
 b1 but really hates b2 Bob likes b2 but

806
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:44,220
 

807
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,539
 really hates b1 Charlie likes them both

808
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:46,539
 

809
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:48,820
 so if you vote on b1

810
00:21:46,529 --> 00:21:48,820
 

811
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:51,399
 Alice and Charlie will vote in favor it

812
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:51,399
 

813
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:53,259
 will pass two to one if you vote on B -

814
00:21:51,389 --> 00:21:53,259
 

815
00:21:51,399 --> 00:21:54,399
 Bob and Charlie will vote in favor and

816
00:21:53,249 --> 00:21:54,399
 

817
00:21:53,259 --> 00:21:56,979
 it will pass two to one

818
00:21:54,389 --> 00:21:56,979
 

819
00:21:54,399 --> 00:21:59,169
 but if you vote on the combination then

820
00:21:56,969 --> 00:21:59,169
 

821
00:21:56,979 --> 00:22:01,690
 only Charlie will vote in favor and it

822
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:01,690
 

823
00:21:59,169 --> 00:22:04,149
 won't pass so combining two bills that

824
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,149
 

825
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:07,869
 would pass might lead to a bill that

826
00:22:04,139 --> 00:22:07,869
 

827
00:22:04,149 --> 00:22:10,629
 won't pass so the outputs of voting are

828
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:10,629
 

829
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:14,499
 not logically consistent even if the

830
00:22:10,619 --> 00:22:14,499
 

831
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:16,449
 views of individual voters are so that's

832
00:22:14,489 --> 00:22:16,449
 

833
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:18,609
 an interesting fact and it is an

834
00:22:16,439 --> 00:22:18,609
 

835
00:22:16,449 --> 00:22:20,799
 attribute that comes from this majority

836
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:20,799
 

837
00:22:18,609 --> 00:22:22,719
 voting algorithm so now of course you're

838
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:22,719
 

839
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,969
 thinking well maybe that's not the right

840
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:24,969
 

841
00:22:22,719 --> 00:22:26,829
 algorithm can we design another one some

842
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:26,829
 

843
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:29,229
 other way of combining the preferences

844
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:29,229
 

845
00:22:26,829 --> 00:22:32,559
 of voters to get an overall decision

846
00:22:29,219 --> 00:22:32,559
 

847
00:22:29,229 --> 00:22:35,739
 which is going to have this for which

848
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:35,739
 

849
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:37,659
 that desired theorem actually holds and

850
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,659
 

851
00:22:35,739 --> 00:22:40,209
 yes you can do that but that system is

852
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:40,209
 

853
00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:42,069
 going to have other weird weird

854
00:22:40,199 --> 00:22:42,069
 

855
00:22:40,209 --> 00:22:43,989
 properties you don't want turns out

856
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:43,989
 

857
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:45,940
 there are various impossibility results

858
00:22:43,979 --> 00:22:45,940
 

859
00:22:43,989 --> 00:22:48,940
 that show that there's not a way to

860
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:48,940
 

861
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:50,589
 combine individual voters preferences in

862
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,589
 

863
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:52,509
 a way that has all the properties you

864
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:52,509
 

865
00:22:50,589 --> 00:22:56,979
 might want this is fundamentally hard

866
00:22:52,499 --> 00:22:56,979
 

867
00:22:52,509 --> 00:22:59,019
 but voting leads to this possibility of

868
00:22:56,969 --> 00:22:59,019
 

869
00:22:56,979 --> 00:23:01,209
 logical inconsistency but now let's

870
00:22:59,009 --> 00:23:01,209
 

871
00:22:59,019 --> 00:23:04,269
 generalize the model will partition our

872
00:23:01,199 --> 00:23:04,269
 

873
00:23:01,209 --> 00:23:06,339
 voters into districts and we'll create a

874
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:06,339
 

875
00:23:04,269 --> 00:23:09,369
 legislature with one representative per

876
00:23:06,329 --> 00:23:09,369
 

877
00:23:06,339 --> 00:23:11,999
 district in a rep and we'll say that a

878
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:11,999
 

879
00:23:09,369 --> 00:23:14,679
 representative is up is perfectly

880
00:23:11,989 --> 00:23:14,679
 

881
00:23:11,999 --> 00:23:16,479
 responsive to their voters to their

882
00:23:14,669 --> 00:23:16,479
 

883
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:19,029
 constituents in the sense that they will

884
00:23:16,469 --> 00:23:19,029
 

885
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:20,669
 support a bill if and only if a majority

886
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:20,669
 

887
00:23:19,029 --> 00:23:23,109
 of their constituents support the bill

888
00:23:20,659 --> 00:23:23,109
 

889
00:23:20,669 --> 00:23:26,649
 all right so that's our model of a

890
00:23:23,099 --> 00:23:26,649
 

891
00:23:23,109 --> 00:23:28,719
 system of voting with legislators so

892
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:28,719
 

893
00:23:26,649 --> 00:23:30,549
 what are the implications of this well

894
00:23:28,709 --> 00:23:30,549
 

895
00:23:28,719 --> 00:23:32,229
 one implication is that the behavior of

896
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:32,229
 

897
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:34,599
 a legislature is not logically

898
00:23:32,219 --> 00:23:34,599
 

899
00:23:32,229 --> 00:23:36,129
 consistent because they behave just like

900
00:23:34,589 --> 00:23:36,129
 

901
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:39,129
 the result of a vote of their

902
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:39,129
 

903
00:23:36,129 --> 00:23:41,019
 constituents it may be the case that

904
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:41,019
 

905
00:23:39,129 --> 00:23:42,869
 they support two bills and yet they

906
00:23:41,009 --> 00:23:42,869
 

907
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:46,179
 don't support the combination of them

908
00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:46,179
 

909
00:23:42,869 --> 00:23:48,459
 the way that they respond to proposals

910
00:23:46,169 --> 00:23:48,459
 

911
00:23:46,179 --> 00:23:52,109
 is not going to seem logically

912
00:23:48,449 --> 00:23:52,109
 

913
00:23:48,459 --> 00:23:54,669
 consistent because it's not in a sense

914
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:54,669
 

915
00:23:52,109 --> 00:23:56,709
 they might support two bills but not

916
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:56,709
 

917
00:23:54,669 --> 00:23:58,690
 support the combination also the

918
00:23:56,699 --> 00:23:58,690
 

919
00:23:56,709 --> 00:24:00,260
 individual legislature notice in this

920
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,260
 

921
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:03,070
 scenario doesn't really

922
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:03,070
 

923
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:06,740
 about the facts what they care about is

924
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:06,740
 

925
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:09,200
 that is is counting basically how many

926
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:09,200
 

927
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:11,900
 of their constituents support this thing

928
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:11,900
 

929
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,030
 versus how many oppose it

930
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:14,030
 

931
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:15,740
 it's not that facts don't matter it's

932
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,740
 

933
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:17,480
 not that argument doesn't matter it's

934
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:17,480
 

935
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:20,210
 just that the facts and the argument

936
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:20,210
 

937
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:22,790
 happen outside the legislature in this

938
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,790
 

939
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:24,200
 model that you have debate among the

940
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,200
 

941
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:26,060
 public you have debate among the

942
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:26,060
 

943
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,670
 constituents they look at the facts they

944
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:28,670
 

945
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:30,400
 evaluate the facts they debate the facts

946
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,400
 

947
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:33,110
 they debate the reasons and arguments

948
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:33,110
 

949
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:35,480
 but then at the end of the day what the

950
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,480
 

951
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:37,760
 legislature does is counting and indeed

952
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:37,760
 

953
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,470
 this is just like an election right an

954
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,470
 

955
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,050
 election is fundamentally a counting

956
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:42,050
 

957
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:44,810
 process when you go into a voting booth

958
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,810
 

959
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:46,760
 let's say to fill out a ballot paper you

960
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,760
 

961
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:49,880
 don't write down your reasons for doing

962
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,880
 

963
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:51,530
 what you did you simply check a box all

964
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:51,530
 

965
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,840
 of the discussion of reasons and

966
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,840
 

967
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:56,180
 arguments and so on happens outside the

968
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:56,180
 

969
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,400
 voting process so they'll hear the

970
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:58,400
 

971
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:59,900
 individual legislator in this model

972
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,900
 

973
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,880
 where they just respond to their

974
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,880
 

975
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:04,120
 constituents they don't care about the

976
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:04,120
 

977
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,500
 facts so remember that slide earlier

978
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:06,500
 

979
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:08,540
 individual legislators seem logically

980
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:08,540
 

981
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,400
 inconsistent and not to care about facts

982
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:10,400
 

983
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:15,140
 that's actually a prediction that

984
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:15,140
 

985
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:17,480
 emerges from this model but wait it gets

986
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:17,480
 

987
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:21,290
 even more complicated let's think about

988
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:21,290
 

989
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:23,300
 legislative strategy that is it's not

990
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,300
 

991
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:25,580
 just the case that these combinations of

992
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:25,580
 

993
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:28,130
 bills come forward and people have to

994
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:28,130
 

995
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:30,200
 decide those are they're made by people

996
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,200
 

997
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:32,510
 so consider the following problem I'll

998
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:32,510
 

999
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,460
 call this the amendment problem so here

1000
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,460
 

1001
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:36,470
 we're given some bill B and we're given

1002
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,470
 

1003
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:38,630
 a set of possible amendments which I'll

1004
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,630
 

1005
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:40,400
 call a one through a n and I'll assume

1006
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,400
 

1007
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:42,620
 again that these are mutually disjoint

1008
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:42,620
 

1009
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,990
 so that the amendments are all sort of

1010
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,990
 

1011
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:46,910
 independent of each other now the

1012
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,910
 

1013
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:48,560
 question is can you add a subset of the

1014
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,560
 

1015
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:50,780
 amendments to the bill in order to

1016
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:50,780
 

1017
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:53,390
 create a comp a combined bill which will

1018
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:53,390
 

1019
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:56,060
 pass that problem turns out to be

1020
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:56,060
 

1021
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:59,450
 np-complete I will leave that as an

1022
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:59,450
 

1023
00:25:56,060 --> 00:26:00,980
 exercise for interested audience members

1024
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,980
 

1025
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:03,440
 but it's the proof is not too difficult

1026
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:03,440
 

1027
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:05,630
 it's a reduction from the subset cover

1028
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,630
 

1029
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,990
 problem nonetheless

1030
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:08,990
 

1031
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:11,570
 what this tells you is that this is

1032
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,570
 

1033
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:14,430
 actually pretty complicated

1034
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,430
 

1035
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:17,310
 now the real world is even more

1036
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:17,310
 

1037
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:19,140
 complicated than that for one thing the

1038
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,140
 

1039
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:21,150
 opinions of individual voters are not

1040
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:21,150
 

1041
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:23,940
 always self consistent people vote based

1042
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,940
 

1043
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:26,370
 on heuristics and yarissa course don't

1044
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:26,370
 

1045
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:29,460
 lead necessarily to self consistent

1046
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,460
 

1047
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:32,760
 results legislators make deals not just

1048
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:32,760
 

1049
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:35,070
 to combine two bills for a vote of

1050
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,070
 

1051
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,960
 everyone but sort of side deals I'll

1052
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,960
 

1053
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:39,300
 vote for your thing now if you vote for

1054
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:39,300
 

1055
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,940
 my thing later so the space of

1056
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:41,940
 

1057
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:43,890
 strategies is even much larger than I

1058
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:43,890
 

1059
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:45,330
 described and of course their

1060
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,330
 

1061
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:48,840
 administrative agencies where a

1062
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,840
 

1063
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:52,310
 legislature might delegate a set of

1064
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:52,310
 

1065
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:54,530
 decisions - to a set of career

1066
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,530
 

1067
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:57,150
 government officials those

1068
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,150
 

1069
00:26:54,530 --> 00:27:00,750
 administrative agencies are indirectly

1070
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:00,750
 

1071
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:03,600
 accountable to voters but but that adds

1072
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:03,600
 

1073
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:05,520
 yet another level of complexity so

1074
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,520
 

1075
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,470
 what's the upshot of all of this there's

1076
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:07,470
 

1077
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,470
 a lot more going on here than you might

1078
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,470
 

1079
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:13,200
 think political scientists do have a

1080
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:13,200
 

1081
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:16,830
 rich and interesting thing to study but

1082
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:16,830
 

1083
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:19,560
 most importantly locally this system

1084
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:19,560
 

1085
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:21,600
 will look irrational if you look just at

1086
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,600
 

1087
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:23,520
 a particular decision-maker a particular

1088
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,520
 

1089
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,790
 agency a particular legislate

1090
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:26,790
 

1091
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:29,490
 legislature or government official what

1092
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:29,490
 

1093
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:31,890
 they do might seem to not make sense and

1094
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,890
 

1095
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:34,680
 indeed if you look only at the local

1096
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,680
 

1097
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:37,380
 picture it might look you're rational

1098
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:37,380
 

1099
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:38,910
 but in fact these people are operating

1100
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:38,910
 

1101
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:42,750
 inside a system that's big and

1102
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:42,750
 

1103
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:44,790
 complicated and we have to give most of

1104
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,790
 

1105
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:46,710
 them at least credit for knowing what

1106
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,710
 

1107
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:48,690
 they're doing and for having a certain

1108
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,690
 

1109
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:51,060
 expertise in how to operate within this

1110
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,060
 

1111
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:54,870
 system so this is complicated all right

1112
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:54,870
 

1113
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:57,510
 so what should we do well one approach

1114
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,510
 

1115
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:59,250
 is to say and and you hear this a lot

1116
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,250
 

1117
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:02,100
 it's not okay to not know how the

1118
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,100
 

1119
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:04,410
 internet works we this is often said

1120
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:04,410
 

1121
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,610
 about political leaders but of course I

1122
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,610
 

1123
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:07,830
 would come back to you and say it's not

1124
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,830
 

1125
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:09,800
 okay not to know how government works if

1126
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,800
 

1127
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:13,650
 you're going to have opinions about it

1128
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:13,650
 

1129
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:16,440
 what we want to do is understand how we

1130
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,440
 

1131
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:19,530
 can get how we can create a system in

1132
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:19,530
 

1133
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:21,060
 which good decisions are made it's

1134
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,060
 

1135
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:23,460
 possible to make good decisions about

1136
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:23,460
 

1137
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:24,420
 something even if you yourself are not

1138
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:24,420
 

1139
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:27,330
 an expert

1140
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:27,330
 

1141
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:29,670
 consider for example a decision you

1142
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,670
 

1143
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:32,550
 might have about whether to have knee

1144
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:32,550
 

1145
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:34,730
 surgery now one approach to making this

1146
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,730
 

1147
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:38,310
 decision is to go to medical school and

1148
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,310
 

1149
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:40,200
 study orthopedics and then work as an

1150
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,200
 

1151
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:41,670
 orthopedist doing many knee surgeries

1152
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,670
 

1153
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,670
 over the years so that you are qualified

1154
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:44,670
 

1155
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:48,240
 to make the decision yourself as to

1156
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:48,240
 

1157
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:51,870
 whether to have the knee surgery but of

1158
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:51,870
 

1159
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:55,080
 course that is that's not going to work

1160
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:55,080
 

1161
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:57,840
 for most people and it's not necessary

1162
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:57,840
 

1163
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:59,400
 right we recognize that we can make good

1164
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,400
 

1165
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,710
 decisions about whether to have knee

1166
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:01,710
 

1167
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:04,620
 surgery not because we know everything

1168
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,620
 

1169
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:06,780
 but because we consult with people who

1170
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,780
 

1171
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:09,420
 know a lot more than us and we're able

1172
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:09,420
 

1173
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:11,670
 to engage constructively with them we

1174
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:11,670
 

1175
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:13,530
 know which questions to ask we know how

1176
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,530
 

1177
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:15,990
 to evaluate their opinions we know when

1178
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,990
 

1179
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:18,390
 to get another opinion and we know how

1180
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:18,390
 

1181
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:20,070
 to think about risk and how to do some

1182
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,070
 

1183
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:23,190
 limited amount of independent research

1184
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:23,190
 

1185
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:26,160
 for ourselves but this is a key thing to

1186
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:26,160
 

1187
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:29,430
 understand that it's too much to ask of

1188
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:29,430
 

1189
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:32,460
 our decision of our political decision

1190
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:32,460
 

1191
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:34,620
 makers that they be expert in the

1192
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:34,620
 

1193
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:36,960
 decisions that they have to make about

1194
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:36,960
 

1195
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:39,120
 technology just as we don't have to be

1196
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:39,120
 

1197
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,750
 expert about knee surgery because

1198
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,750
 

1199
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:44,490
 political leaders have to be generalists

1200
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,490
 

1201
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:46,850
 one of the the lessons I learned in

1202
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,850
 

1203
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:49,080
 working with senior decision-makers is

1204
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,080
 

1205
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:52,050
 that although I might have come in

1206
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:52,050
 

1207
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:56,010
 thinking that the decisions they had to

1208
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:56,010
 

1209
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:58,470
 make in my area were extremely complex

1210
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,470
 

1211
00:29:56,010 --> 00:30:00,450
 and technical and really very hard to

1212
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,450
 

1213
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:02,730
 make without a lot of access to a lot of

1214
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,730
 

1215
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:04,530
 expertise the same is true about pretty

1216
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,530
 

1217
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:09,210
 much every decision they had to make all

1218
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:09,210
 

1219
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:10,950
 day and and it constantly context switch

1220
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,950
 

1221
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:14,040
 between different decisions in different

1222
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:14,040
 

1223
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:17,610
 areas and so it's just not possible for

1224
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:17,610
 

1225
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:20,190
 an for that for that leader to know

1226
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,190
 

1227
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:21,780
 everything they need to know to make a

1228
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,780
 

1229
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:25,380
 decision they have to work with experts

1230
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:25,380
 

1231
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:27,300
 and those experts are us so let me go

1232
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:27,300
 

1233
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:30,150
 back to this question that I raised at

1234
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:30,150
 

1235
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:33,510
 the beginning and that is how can an

1236
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:33,510
 

1237
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:36,720
 expert work with a decision maker to try

1238
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,720
 

1239
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:38,220
 to get to a good decision and there's an

1240
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,220
 

1241
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,500
 analogy I think that's really

1242
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:40,500
 

1243
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:44,580
 helpful in thinking about this because

1244
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:44,580
 

1245
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:47,340
 it is a kind of decision that we that

1246
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:47,340
 

1247
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:49,350
 we're all used to thinking about suppose

1248
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:49,350
 

1249
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:51,659
 that the decision maker your friend

1250
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,659
 

1251
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:54,330
 Justin is coming to town and he wants to

1252
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:54,330
 

1253
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:57,530
 know where to have dinner so he's coming

1254
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,530
 

1255
00:30:54,330 --> 00:31:00,539
 to your hometown you're the expert on

1256
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,539
 

1257
00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:01,919
 having dinner in your town but he's the

1258
00:31:00,529 --> 00:31:01,919
 

1259
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:04,110
 decision-maker he's the one who's

1260
00:31:01,909 --> 00:31:04,110
 

1261
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,929
 actually going to eat the meal so how

1262
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,929
 

1263
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:10,080
 can you help him make a good decision

1264
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:10,080
 

1265
00:31:05,929 --> 00:31:15,000
 well there are a couple of approaches

1266
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:15,000
 

1267
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:18,510
 that we as technical people like to take

1268
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:18,510
 

1269
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:21,120
 to interfacing with this political

1270
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,120
 

1271
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:24,270
 decision makers which are not going to

1272
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:24,270
 

1273
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:26,549
 be helpful for our friend Justin the

1274
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,549
 

1275
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:30,659
 first approach is to say we are

1276
00:31:26,539 --> 00:31:30,659
 

1277
00:31:26,549 --> 00:31:33,030
 scientists we don't do politics we are

1278
00:31:30,649 --> 00:31:33,030
 

1279
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:35,220
 going to provide just the facts so our

1280
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,220
 

1281
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:37,470
 role is to provide Justin with the facts

1282
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:37,470
 

1283
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:40,620
 he needs in order to decide where to eat

1284
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:40,620
 

1285
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:42,929
 and so we give him menus from all the

1286
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:42,929
 

1287
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:45,600
 restaurants in town and we give him a

1288
00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:45,600
 

1289
00:31:42,929 --> 00:31:47,039
 textbook on nutrition and now he knows

1290
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:47,039
 

1291
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,460
 everything he needs to know to make the

1292
00:31:47,029 --> 00:31:49,460
 

1293
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:51,780
 decision that's not really helpful is it

1294
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,780
 

1295
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:53,820
 and for a few reasons first of all it's

1296
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:53,820
 

1297
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:56,640
 too much information and second it's not

1298
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:56,640
 

1299
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:58,140
 the information he really wants right if

1300
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:58,140
 

1301
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,080
 you think about where you want to have

1302
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:01,080
 

1303
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:02,610
 dinner yes the menu matters but there's

1304
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,610
 

1305
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:06,390
 a lot of other information that matters

1306
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:06,390
 

1307
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:08,580
 as well so just the facts it's not going

1308
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,580
 

1309
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:11,400
 to work it's too much information it's

1310
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:11,400
 

1311
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:14,760
 the wrong kind of information and it is

1312
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:14,760
 

1313
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:16,850
 throwing away what you know as a person

1314
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,850
 

1315
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:18,960
 who often has dinner in your hometown

1316
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,960
 

1317
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:22,230
 it's throwing away a lot of the

1318
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:22,230
 

1319
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,549
 knowledge that you have another approach

1320
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,549
 

1321
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:25,919
 you can take is just dictate the

1322
00:32:23,539 --> 00:32:25,919
 

1323
00:32:23,549 --> 00:32:29,159
 decision you can just think to yourself

1324
00:32:25,909 --> 00:32:29,159
 

1325
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:32,100
 what do what would I do if I were having

1326
00:32:29,149 --> 00:32:32,100
 

1327
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:35,070
 dinner in this town tonight and you just

1328
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:35,070
 

1329
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:39,240
 tell Justin to go there but what if he

1330
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:39,240
 

1331
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:44,039
 doesn't like poutine what if his tastes

1332
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:44,039
 

1333
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:45,720
 are different from yours you're not

1334
00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:45,720
 

1335
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:47,159
 going to get to a good decision and by

1336
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,159
 

1337
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,080
 the way if we're talking about a

1338
00:32:47,149 --> 00:32:49,080
 

1339
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:51,390
 political decision a decision that is

1340
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:51,390
 

1341
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:54,090
 going to have some kind of legal force

1342
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:54,090
 

1343
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:56,370
 I'll ask you as well who elected you who

1344
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,370
 

1345
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:59,060
 made you the decision-maker who gave you

1346
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,060
 

1347
00:32:56,370 --> 00:33:00,840
 legitimacy to decide these things for

1348
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:00,840
 

1349
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:03,960
 for other people

1350
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:03,960
 

1351
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:05,490
 President Obama occasionally in a moment

1352
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,490
 

1353
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,330
 of frustration might ask one of his

1354
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,330
 

1355
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:09,090
 advisers

1356
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,090
 

1357
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:11,220
 how many electoral votes did you get as

1358
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,220
 

1359
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:13,500
 a way of reminding them whose decision

1360
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:13,500
 

1361
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:15,300
 it was that really mattered and had

1362
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:15,300
 

1363
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:19,290
 legitimacy

1364
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:19,290
 

1365
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:23,070
 so who elected you that is you know

1366
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:23,070
 

1367
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:25,410
 fundamentally it is Justin's decision

1368
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,410
 

1369
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:29,910
 whether to wear to have dinner and

1370
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:29,910
 

1371
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:31,920
 making and meeting the goals that he has

1372
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,920
 

1373
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:34,410
 in making that decision is is what

1374
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:34,410
 

1375
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:36,600
 you're trying to do so just telling him

1376
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,600
 

1377
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:38,940
 to do what you would do is not going to

1378
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:38,940
 

1379
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:40,740
 cut it either earlier also you can't

1380
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:40,740
 

1381
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:42,870
 really don't just download your brain to

1382
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:42,870
 

1383
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:45,090
 him so what can you do what can you do

1384
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:45,090
 

1385
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:47,670
 that's really useful what you need to do

1386
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,670
 

1387
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:51,990
 to help him make a good decision is to

1388
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:51,990
 

1389
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:56,000
 somehow combine your knowledge with his

1390
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:56,000
 

1391
00:33:51,990 --> 00:34:00,350
 preferences or really your knowledge

1392
00:33:55,990 --> 00:34:00,350
 

1393
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:04,050
 with his knowledge and preferences so

1394
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:04,050
 

1395
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:06,570
 remember that public decision makers

1396
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,570
 

1397
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:08,640
 know a lot about it the very complex

1398
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,640
 

1399
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:10,260
 system in which they're embedded and

1400
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,260
 

1401
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:12,360
 they know a lot about what it's possible

1402
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:12,360
 

1403
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:13,680
 to get done and how to get it done and

1404
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,680
 

1405
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,150
 that's very important in making this

1406
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:15,150
 

1407
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,380
 decision so how do you combine your

1408
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,380
 

1409
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:18,810
 knowledge with his knowledge and

1410
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:18,810
 

1411
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:22,080
 preferences and so that happens I think

1412
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,080
 

1413
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:24,660
 in two stages if you want to understand

1414
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:24,660
 

1415
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:26,910
 where Justin how to help Justin pick

1416
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:26,910
 

1417
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:28,530
 good a good place for dinner you need to

1418
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,530
 

1419
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:29,880
 do two things you need to get his

1420
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,880
 

1421
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:31,530
 knowledge and preferences and then

1422
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:31,530
 

1423
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,130
 structure the decision space here's how

1424
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,130
 

1425
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:33,780
 this works

1426
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,780
 

1427
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:35,580
 you start by asking them a bunch of

1428
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:35,580
 

1429
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:38,970
 questions what kind of food do you like

1430
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:38,970
 

1431
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:41,130
 are you a vegetarian or a vegan are you

1432
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,130
 

1433
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:44,250
 allergic to anything what's your budget

1434
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,250
 

1435
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:47,580
 how much time do you have do you have a

1436
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,580
 

1437
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:50,160
 car are you an adventurous eater are you

1438
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:50,160
 

1439
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:52,170
 a foodie or do you just want fuel do you

1440
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:52,170
 

1441
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:54,510
 care about atmosphere or do you only

1442
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,510
 

1443
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:57,060
 care about the food etc so a lot of

1444
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,060
 

1445
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:58,410
 questions like that and once you

1446
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,410
 

1447
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:00,750
 understand the answers to those

1448
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,750
 

1449
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:02,280
 questions now you can narrow down the

1450
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,280
 

1451
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:03,190
 decision space and structure the

1452
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,190
 

1453
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,500
 decision space

1454
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,500
 

1455
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:06,970
 so you can say something like this well

1456
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:06,970
 

1457
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,620
 there's a pretty good Italian bistro

1458
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,620
 

1459
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:11,370
 it's right across the street from your

1460
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:11,370
 

1461
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:14,590
 hotel it's inside it's in your budget

1462
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,590
 

1463
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:17,080
 it's convenient it's open late but it's

1464
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:17,080
 

1465
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:18,670
 not the most exciting place or if you're

1466
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:18,670
 

1467
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,470
 in a mood for an adventure you can take

1468
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,470
 

1469
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:21,970
 an expensive taxi ride across town

1470
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,970
 

1471
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:25,740
 there's this new place that opened up

1472
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,740
 

1473
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:29,620
 and you said you and you said you liked

1474
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:29,620
 

1475
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:31,390
 and you said you like South American

1476
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:31,390
 

1477
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:35,410
 cuisine well this is a great Ecuadorian

1478
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:35,410
 

1479
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:37,000
 place it caters to vegans like you and

1480
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,000
 

1481
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:39,340
 so you might go there if you're up for

1482
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:39,340
 

1483
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,110
 something more adventurous or if you're

1484
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:41,110
 

1485
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:45,070
 in the mood to spend a lot of money the

1486
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:45,070
 

1487
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:46,600
 best place in town is wherever so you

1488
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,600
 

1489
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:48,250
 fit you found out what they were

1490
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:48,250
 

1491
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,900
 interested in what their preferences

1492
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,900
 

1493
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:52,060
 were and you structured the decision

1494
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:52,060
 

1495
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:53,680
 space you gave them a few decisions you

1496
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,680
 

1497
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:56,620
 explain the pros and cons of those

1498
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:56,620
 

1499
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:59,710
 decisions in terms of their interests so

1500
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:59,710
 

1501
00:35:56,620 --> 00:36:01,780
 this is a way to be really useful to to

1502
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,780
 

1503
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:04,090
 your friend in figuring out where to

1504
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:04,090
 

1505
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:06,190
 have dinner and several things to notice

1506
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,190
 

1507
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:09,550
 about this first of all this is a multi

1508
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:09,550
 

1509
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:11,530
 round protocol this is not just impart

1510
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,530
 

1511
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:13,000
 some knowledge and then go home you're

1512
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,000
 

1513
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:14,530
 going to go back and forth with this

1514
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:14,530
 

1515
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,570
 person you're going to find out

1516
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,570
 

1517
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:18,040
 information about them you're going to

1518
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,040
 

1519
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:19,810
 actually do some research and you're

1520
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,810
 

1521
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,760
 going to try to put yourself into their

1522
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,760
 

1523
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:26,830
 mindset to help them make a better

1524
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:26,830
 

1525
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:29,560
 decision also having done this if you

1526
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,560
 

1527
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:32,110
 are if you are ever going to have to

1528
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:32,110
 

1529
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:34,540
 recommend a dinner place to your friend

1530
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,540
 

1531
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:36,100
 again it makes sense afterward to follow

1532
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:36,100
 

1533
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:39,070
 up and say hey what did you do how did

1534
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:39,070
 

1535
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:40,840
 you like it and that will help you make

1536
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,840
 

1537
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:43,420
 the decision that will help you give

1538
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:43,420
 

1539
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:44,980
 better advice in the future so if you do

1540
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:44,980
 

1541
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:47,380
 this right you can build a kind of

1542
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:47,380
 

1543
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:49,090
 engagement over time and you can build a

1544
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:49,090
 

1545
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:52,690
 kind of mutual trust where your friend

1546
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,690
 

1547
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:54,580
 comes to trust your advice and you come

1548
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,580
 

1549
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:56,080
 to you better understand what they like

1550
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:56,080
 

1551
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:58,870
 and don't like and it's that

1552
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:58,870
 

1553
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:00,460
 relationship of trust do to engagement

1554
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,460
 

1555
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:03,820
 over time which leads to a really

1556
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:03,820
 

1557
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:06,820
 productive relationship with the

1558
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:06,820
 

1559
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:09,610
 decision-maker so this is a lot of work

1560
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:09,610
 

1561
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:11,230
 right it's a multi round protocol you

1562
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,230
 

1563
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:13,180
 have to ask a lot of questions you have

1564
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,180
 

1565
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:14,890
 to understand what are their preferences

1566
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:14,890
 

1567
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:16,359
 and what they're trying to do you have

1568
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,359
 

1569
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:18,309
 to put yourself mentally

1570
00:37:16,349 --> 00:37:18,309
 

1571
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:20,619
 their shoes and understand how to

1572
00:37:18,299 --> 00:37:20,619
 

1573
00:37:18,309 --> 00:37:22,900
 structure a decision space for them but

1574
00:37:20,609 --> 00:37:22,900
 

1575
00:37:20,619 --> 00:37:24,849
 this is the way to improve the quality

1576
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:24,849
 

1577
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:26,650
 of the of the dinners that your friend

1578
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:26,650
 

1579
00:37:24,849 --> 00:37:29,410
 is going to have improves the quality of

1580
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,410
 

1581
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:32,259
 the policy decisions that a policy maker

1582
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,259
 

1583
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:35,249
 is going to have now what does that mean

1584
00:37:32,249 --> 00:37:35,249
 

1585
00:37:32,259 --> 00:37:38,650
 in terms of the role of our community in

1586
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:38,650
 

1587
00:37:35,249 --> 00:37:41,079
 the policy-making process the first

1588
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,079
 

1589
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:43,599
 thing I would say is that in order to

1590
00:37:41,069 --> 00:37:43,599
 

1591
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:44,440
 have real influence on the decisions

1592
00:37:43,589 --> 00:37:44,440
 

1593
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:47,049
 that get made

1594
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:47,049
 

1595
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:50,019
 you need to have boots on the ground now

1596
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:50,019
 

1597
00:37:47,049 --> 00:37:52,660
 not everyone is going to go and meet

1598
00:37:50,009 --> 00:37:52,660
 

1599
00:37:50,019 --> 00:37:56,470
 with policy makers and engage in this

1600
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:56,470
 

1601
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:59,109
 process in a deep and long-term way some

1602
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:59,109
 

1603
00:37:56,470 --> 00:38:02,140
 of us will write letters some of us will

1604
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:02,140
 

1605
00:37:59,109 --> 00:38:05,470
 sign on to manifestos some of us will

1606
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:05,470
 

1607
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:08,079
 simply just speak and vote and that is

1608
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,079
 

1609
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:10,869
 wonderful but we also need some people

1610
00:38:08,069 --> 00:38:10,869
 

1611
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:14,109
 from our community to go and engage on

1612
00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:14,109
 

1613
00:38:10,869 --> 00:38:16,720
 behalf of the community with the with

1614
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:16,720
 

1615
00:38:14,109 --> 00:38:18,730
 the policy process and that means we

1616
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:18,730
 

1617
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:22,599
 need to think about how to create career

1618
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,599
 

1619
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:26,230
 paths which reward this how we can make

1620
00:38:22,589 --> 00:38:26,230
 

1621
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:27,999
 it either a career for someone with a

1622
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,999
 

1623
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:29,920
 serious technical background in this

1624
00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:29,920
 

1625
00:38:27,999 --> 00:38:33,400
 field or probably better

1626
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:33,400
 

1627
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:36,489
 a serious component of one type of

1628
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:36,489
 

1629
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:38,680
 career in this field to engage with

1630
00:38:36,479 --> 00:38:38,680
 

1631
00:38:36,489 --> 00:38:42,130
 decision makers and to engage in the

1632
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:42,130
 

1633
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:45,430
 policy process in in a really in a

1634
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:45,430
 

1635
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:47,440
 repeated and deep way if we don't create

1636
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,440
 

1637
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:49,989
 those career paths if this is something

1638
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:49,989
 

1639
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:52,980
 that people only do at a sacrifice to

1640
00:38:49,979 --> 00:38:52,980
 

1641
00:38:49,989 --> 00:38:55,900
 their own career at a cost to themselves

1642
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:55,900
 

1643
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:58,059
 then it will be much more difficult and

1644
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:58,059
 

1645
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,940
 fewer people will do it this needs to be

1646
00:38:58,049 --> 00:38:59,940
 

1647
00:38:58,059 --> 00:39:02,529
 an activity that we learn to respect

1648
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:02,529
 

1649
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:05,109
 when people in our community do it well

1650
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:05,109
 

1651
00:39:02,529 --> 00:39:07,809
 we need to build incentives whether it's

1652
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:07,809
 

1653
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:11,950
 career incentives in academia whether it

1654
00:39:07,799 --> 00:39:11,950
 

1655
00:39:07,809 --> 00:39:14,619
 is understanding that doing it doing a

1656
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:14,619
 

1657
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:16,539
 time working in policy in government or

1658
00:39:14,609 --> 00:39:16,539
 

1659
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:20,249
 in a non-profit on important policy

1660
00:39:16,529 --> 00:39:20,249
 

1661
00:39:16,539 --> 00:39:24,009
 issues is a valuable part of one kind of

1662
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:24,009
 

1663
00:39:20,249 --> 00:39:29,710
 academic career just as academic lawyers

1664
00:39:23,999 --> 00:39:29,710
 

1665
00:39:24,009 --> 00:39:31,960
 and economists respect career paths

1666
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,960
 

1667
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:34,690
 do spend time working in the policy

1668
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:34,690
 

1669
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:38,200
 process hands on and think of it not as

1670
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:38,200
 

1671
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:41,020
 a detour or a stop from an important

1672
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:41,020
 

1673
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:43,390
 career but in fact a valuable part of

1674
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:43,390
 

1675
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:44,380
 one kind of career we need to figure out

1676
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,380
 

1677
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:47,049
 how to do that

1678
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:47,049
 

1679
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:50,190
 within our own community for people in

1680
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:50,190
 

1681
00:39:47,049 --> 00:39:52,809
 industry we also need to understand how

1682
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,809
 

1683
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:55,480
 how we can better enable and support

1684
00:39:52,799 --> 00:39:55,480
 

1685
00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:57,059
 careers that take time out spend some

1686
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:57,059
 

1687
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:59,619
 time working in the policy process

1688
00:39:57,049 --> 00:39:59,619
 

1689
00:39:57,059 --> 00:40:01,480
 there's been some progress made in this

1690
00:39:59,609 --> 00:40:01,480
 

1691
00:39:59,619 --> 00:40:03,490
 area in the u.s. through groups like the

1692
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:03,490
 

1693
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:05,529
 u.s. digital service and I'd be happy to

1694
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,529
 

1695
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:07,359
 talk with folks about that afterward but

1696
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:07,359
 

1697
00:40:05,529 --> 00:40:09,490
 fundamentally it needs to come

1698
00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:09,490
 

1699
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:12,220
 culturally from our community that this

1700
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,220
 

1701
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:15,490
 is an activity we respect when it's done

1702
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:15,490
 

1703
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:18,490
 well and seriously this is really

1704
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,490
 

1705
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:21,279
 important important decisions about what

1706
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,279
 

1707
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:23,950
 happens in our community to our

1708
00:40:21,269 --> 00:40:23,950
 

1709
00:40:21,279 --> 00:40:28,390
 community important are being made and

1710
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:28,390
 

1711
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:30,940
 will continue to be made the path of of

1712
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,940
 

1713
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:33,730
 the technology that we're designing in

1714
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:33,730
 

1715
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:36,069
 our hopes that this technology is going

1716
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,069
 

1717
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:39,760
 to improve people's lives all around the

1718
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:39,760
 

1719
00:40:36,069 --> 00:40:41,799
 world depend on the political systems in

1720
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,799
 

1721
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,960
 all of our countries making good

1722
00:40:41,789 --> 00:40:43,960
 

1723
00:40:41,799 --> 00:40:46,390
 decisions and sustaining those in

1724
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:46,390
 

1725
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:49,210
 implementing those decisions well about

1726
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:49,210
 

1727
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:50,859
 the technology there's a lot at stake if

1728
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,859
 

1729
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:52,900
 we believe that what we're doing is

1730
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:52,900
 

1731
00:40:50,859 --> 00:40:55,839
 important and we wouldn't be here if we

1732
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:55,839
 

1733
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:57,880
 didn't then we need to take this

1734
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:57,880
 

1735
00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:00,520
 seriously because everything that we are

1736
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:00,520
 

1737
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:03,039
 striving for in changing the world could

1738
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:03,039
 

1739
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:05,260
 be at risk if we do this wrong this is

1740
00:41:03,029 --> 00:41:05,260
 

1741
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:08,079
 really important we need to be in the

1742
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:08,079
 

1743
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:11,230
 room when the decisions are made and

1744
00:41:08,069 --> 00:41:11,230
 

1745
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:13,680
 step one is to get people into the room

1746
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,680
 

1747
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:16,930
 as advisors to the policy makers and

1748
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:16,930
 

1749
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:20,440
 step two the future that I would like to

1750
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,440
 

1751
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:22,150
 see is one in which some perhaps of the

1752
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:22,150
 

1753
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:24,369
 more junior members of our community

1754
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,369
 

1755
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:26,230
 some of our students or interns or new

1756
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:26,230
 

1757
00:41:24,369 --> 00:41:29,349
 employees will one day be the

1758
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:29,349
 

1759
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:31,809
 decision-makers themselves we have we

1760
00:41:29,339 --> 00:41:31,809
 

1761
00:41:29,349 --> 00:41:33,010
 have a lot at stake and I would urge you

1762
00:41:31,799 --> 00:41:33,010
 

1763
00:41:31,809 --> 00:41:35,319
 to take this seriously

1764
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,319
 

1765
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:37,750
 and I would be happy to talk afterward

1766
00:41:35,309 --> 00:41:37,750
 

1767
00:41:35,319 --> 00:41:41,579
 with anyone who is interested in how to

1768
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:41,579
 

1769
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:41,579
 pursue such a career Thanks

1770
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:48,660
 

1771
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:55,330
 and we have some we have some time for

1772
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:55,330
 

1773
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:57,670
 Q&A hello is there some researcher or

1774
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,670
 

1775
00:41:55,330 --> 00:42:00,640
 any examples of systemic biases for

1776
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:00,640
 

1777
00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:02,440
 democracy algorithm so either based on a

1778
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:02,440
 

1779
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:04,780
 theoretical model or actually observed

1780
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:04,780
 

1781
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:06,760
 with experiments so I was thinking maybe

1782
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:06,760
 

1783
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:07,990
 something like a crowded theater example

1784
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:07,990
 

1785
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:10,510
 where everybody votes on their own

1786
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:10,510
 

1787
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:12,940
 personal interests and then it doesn't

1788
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,940
 

1789
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:17,410
 help everyone as a community Thanks

1790
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:17,410
 

1791
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:22,090
 sure obviously there are lots of I

1792
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:22,090
 

1793
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:24,190
 talked about one sort of perverse or

1794
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,190
 

1795
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:25,930
 inefficient way in which public

1796
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,930
 

1797
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:28,240
 processes could lead to inefficient

1798
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,240
 

1799
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:30,640
 outcomes there are many others and

1800
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:30,640
 

1801
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:33,880
 certainly collective action problems are

1802
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:33,880
 

1803
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:36,190
 one of them right a situation where we

1804
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:36,190
 

1805
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:38,160
 would all be better off if we all did a

1806
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:38,160
 

1807
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:41,380
 certain thing but each of us

1808
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:41,380
 

1809
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:43,000
 individually might benefit from not

1810
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:43,000
 

1811
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:44,820
 doing that thing or we might be stuck in

1812
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:44,820
 

1813
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,440
 in equilibrium in which no one does it

1814
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:47,440
 

1815
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:49,180
 and I think this is certainly true this

1816
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:49,180
 

1817
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,950
 can happen in a lot of ways within the

1818
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:50,950
 

1819
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:52,870
 political system and by the way it can

1820
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:52,870
 

1821
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:55,200
 also happen in machine learning systems

1822
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:55,200
 

1823
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:57,670
 if we are building systems that are

1824
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:57,670
 

1825
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:00,670
 making consequential decisions about

1826
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:00,670
 

1827
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:04,780
 people there is a bad equilibrium we can

1828
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:04,780
 

1829
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:07,330
 be in where my system correctly predicts

1830
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:07,330
 

1831
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:09,640
 that other systems will treat someone

1832
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,640
 

1833
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:12,510
 negatively and I treat them negatively

1834
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:12,510
 

1835
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:15,250
 as a result of that accurate prediction

1836
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:15,250
 

1837
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:17,200
 and so there is an equilibrium in

1838
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,200
 

1839
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:18,820
 there's certainly an equilibrium of

1840
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:18,820
 

1841
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,740
 discrimination that can exist in a

1842
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:20,740
 

1843
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:22,600
 society right where we're not willing to

1844
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:22,600
 

1845
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:25,960
 invest in or support a person because

1846
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:25,960
 

1847
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:27,550
 others are discriminating and we as

1848
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:27,550
 

1849
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:29,620
 members of our society have a

1850
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:29,620
 

1851
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:31,360
 responsibility to break that cycle and

1852
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:31,360
 

1853
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:32,860
 that's true whether in our personal

1854
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:32,860
 

1855
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:35,380
 lives it's also true I think in the

1856
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:35,380
 

1857
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:37,510
 systems that we build in field that

1858
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:37,510
 

1859
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:39,760
 there is a cycle of discrimination and

1860
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,760
 

1861
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:42,970
 we need to think about how the systems

1862
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:42,970
 

1863
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:46,050
 we build can not only opt out of that

1864
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,050
 

1865
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:48,880
 cycle but actually help to break it

1866
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,880
 

1867
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:50,380
 thanks for a great talk so I don't want

1868
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:50,380
 

1869
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,870
 to suggest that technology is the

1870
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:52,870
 

1871
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:55,300
 solution to everything but what are some

1872
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:55,300
 

1873
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:57,610
 of the roles that technology could play

1874
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:57,610
 

1875
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:59,680
 in helping us build a more deliberative

1876
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,680
 

1877
00:43:57,610 --> 00:44:00,349
 democracy and that might include

1878
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:00,349
 

1879
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,210
 anything

1880
00:44:00,339 --> 00:44:02,210
 

1881
00:44:00,349 --> 00:44:03,829
 from convener toriel optimization to

1882
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,829
 

1883
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:07,999
 natural language dialogue to human

1884
00:44:03,819 --> 00:44:07,999
 

1885
00:44:03,829 --> 00:44:12,109
 factors sure well I guess I would start

1886
00:44:07,989 --> 00:44:12,109
 

1887
00:44:07,999 --> 00:44:16,239
 with the current challenges that we face

1888
00:44:12,099 --> 00:44:16,239
 

1889
00:44:12,109 --> 00:44:19,989
 in using algorithmically mediated

1890
00:44:16,229 --> 00:44:19,989
 

1891
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:23,119
 platforms for political conversation and

1892
00:44:19,979 --> 00:44:23,119
 

1893
00:44:19,989 --> 00:44:25,099
 the ways in which that has led to some

1894
00:44:23,109 --> 00:44:25,099
 

1895
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:27,440
 bad outcomes so there's a lot of

1896
00:44:25,089 --> 00:44:27,440
 

1897
00:44:25,099 --> 00:44:31,160
 unanswered questions about how and why

1898
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:31,160
 

1899
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:32,779
 that has happened and is happening to

1900
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:32,779
 

1901
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:34,460
 what extent is that due only to

1902
00:44:32,769 --> 00:44:34,460
 

1903
00:44:32,779 --> 00:44:36,170
 manipulation versus the inherent

1904
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:36,170
 

1905
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:41,329
 dynamics of the system but certainly

1906
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:41,329
 

1907
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:45,410
 understanding how to build platforms for

1908
00:44:41,319 --> 00:44:45,410
 

1909
00:44:41,329 --> 00:44:49,970
 online public communication that tend to

1910
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:49,970
 

1911
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:52,849
 foster robust and healthy conversation

1912
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,849
 

1913
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:55,400
 is a huge challenge so I think that's

1914
00:44:52,839 --> 00:44:55,400
 

1915
00:44:52,849 --> 00:44:57,200
 number one number two is there are a lot

1916
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:57,200
 

1917
00:44:55,400 --> 00:45:00,170
 of things that governments do which

1918
00:44:57,190 --> 00:45:00,170
 

1919
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:03,259
 could be done more efficiently more

1920
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,259
 

1921
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:06,680
 precisely and perhaps with less waste

1922
00:45:03,249 --> 00:45:06,680
 

1923
00:45:03,259 --> 00:45:09,289
 if decision-making processes are

1924
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:09,289
 

1925
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:11,239
 improved and there's a lot of room for

1926
00:45:09,279 --> 00:45:11,239
 

1927
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:13,549
 machine learning sort of in the engine

1928
00:45:11,229 --> 00:45:13,549
 

1929
00:45:11,239 --> 00:45:17,779
 room of government if you will a lot of

1930
00:45:13,539 --> 00:45:17,779
 

1931
00:45:13,549 --> 00:45:19,670
 what one thing that you see when you're

1932
00:45:17,769 --> 00:45:19,670
 

1933
00:45:17,779 --> 00:45:23,599
 inside government as opposed to outside

1934
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:23,599
 

1935
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:27,769
 it is how much governments are doing

1936
00:45:23,589 --> 00:45:27,769
 

1937
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:31,609
 that is sort of below the waterline if

1938
00:45:27,759 --> 00:45:31,609
 

1939
00:45:27,769 --> 00:45:33,109
 you will that contributes to people

1940
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,109
 

1941
00:45:31,609 --> 00:45:35,119
 being able to live their lives in a

1942
00:45:33,099 --> 00:45:35,119
 

1943
00:45:33,109 --> 00:45:36,499
 reasonable way but is not necessarily

1944
00:45:35,109 --> 00:45:36,499
 

1945
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:40,009
 visible and whether it's things like

1946
00:45:36,489 --> 00:45:40,009
 

1947
00:45:36,499 --> 00:45:43,160
 meat inspections or the processes that

1948
00:45:39,999 --> 00:45:43,160
 

1949
00:45:40,009 --> 00:45:46,130
 lead to say highway problems being

1950
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:46,130
 

1951
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:48,229
 repaired there's a ton of space just for

1952
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,229
 

1953
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:53,390
 optimization of processes I guess I

1954
00:45:48,219 --> 00:45:53,390
 

1955
00:45:48,229 --> 00:45:58,279
 would point to those as two examples you

1956
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:58,279
 

1957
00:45:53,390 --> 00:46:00,739
 described an algorithm for creating a

1958
00:45:58,269 --> 00:46:00,739
 

1959
00:45:58,279 --> 00:46:03,680
 increasingly restrictive set of filters

1960
00:46:00,729 --> 00:46:03,680
 

1961
00:46:00,739 --> 00:46:05,060
 until one or a small number of possible

1962
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:05,060
 

1963
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:08,810
 decisions

1964
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:08,810
 

1965
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:10,730
 and then you can go ahead but I think in

1966
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,730
 

1967
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:12,860
 the case of thinking about the effects

1968
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,860
 

1969
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:15,830
 of artificial intelligence the space of

1970
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:15,830
 

1971
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:17,900
 possible actions is even looser and less

1972
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:17,900
 

1973
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:20,480
 well defined than the possible public

1974
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:20,480
 

1975
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:23,180
 processes that you've been talking about

1976
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:23,180
 

1977
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:27,110
 any thoughts sure no I think that's

1978
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:27,110
 

1979
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:31,550
 right but at the same time public

1980
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:31,550
 

1981
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:36,350
 decision-making processes have dealt

1982
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:36,350
 

1983
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:38,660
 with all kinds of very deep complex and

1984
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:38,660
 

1985
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:40,690
 long-lasting challenges and I'm thinking

1986
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:40,690
 

1987
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:43,610
 of things like poverty and economic

1988
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:43,610
 

1989
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:47,690
 inequality I'm thinking of things like

1990
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:47,690
 

1991
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:50,150
 oppression and in warfare on thinking

1992
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,150
 

1993
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:52,880
 about things like violent crime and

1994
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,880
 

1995
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:56,690
 financial crime these are incredibly

1996
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:56,690
 

1997
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:59,660
 difficult and multifaceted issues with

1998
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,660
 

1999
00:46:56,690 --> 00:47:02,810
 that are not the sort of thing one

2000
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,810
 

2001
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:05,090
 solves and yet decision our

2002
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,090
 

2003
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:07,460
 decision-making processes have coped

2004
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,460
 

2005
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:10,720
 with them over time with differing

2006
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:10,720
 

2007
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:12,980
 levels of success so I think of the

2008
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:12,980
 

2009
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:15,860
 public discourse and decision making

2010
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:15,860
 

2011
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:17,540
 about AI and machine learning not as

2012
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:17,540
 

2013
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:20,480
 something that will happen at sort of as

2014
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:20,480
 

2015
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:23,000
 a single event or decision but as a

2016
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:23,000
 

2017
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,380
 sequence of smaller events just like the

2018
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:24,380
 

2019
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,020
 way that governments deal with say

2020
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:27,020
 

2021
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:29,900
 poverty right it is a long lasting

2022
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,900
 

2023
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:31,550
 challenge and it's one that leads to

2024
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:31,550
 

2025
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:33,620
 many detailed decisions that are made

2026
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:33,620
 

2027
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:35,540
 over time and the decisions involve

2028
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:35,540
 

2029
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:36,800
 values and they involve planning and

2030
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:36,800
 

2031
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:39,380
 they involve a lot of empirical

2032
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:39,380
 

2033
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:42,260
 questions about what would be the effect

2034
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:42,260
 

2035
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:43,640
 if we did a versus B and I think that I

2036
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:43,640
 

2037
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:45,110
 think in this space the same is going to

2038
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:45,110
 

2039
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:48,350
 be true it's going to be a longer

2040
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:48,350
 

2041
00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:50,420
 process of smaller decisions how do

2042
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:50,420
 

2043
00:47:48,350 --> 00:47:56,480
 folks like us get involved in that

2044
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:56,480
 

2045
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:59,270
 process well I think it is engagement

2046
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:59,270
 

2047
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,890
 over time with the public processes that

2048
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:00,890
 

2049
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:05,750
 are making these decisions this is

2050
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:05,750
 

2051
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:08,330
 another reason why why the idea of

2052
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:08,330
 

2053
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:10,670
 engagement over time with the process

2054
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,670
 

2055
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:15,080
 and especially engagement over time with

2056
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:15,080
 

2057
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:16,910
 decision-makers is important if you are

2058
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:16,910
 

2059
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:18,780
 the person that a decision maker or

2060
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,780
 

2061
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:21,030
 their staff thinks to call

2062
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:21,030
 

2063
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:24,660
 when a complicated question about this

2064
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:24,660
 

2065
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:26,880
 comes up then you're really in the you

2066
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:26,880
 

2067
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:28,890
 know in a position to do some good but

2068
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:28,890
 

2069
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,570
 you don't get to be the person they call

2070
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,570
 

2071
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:32,490
 when they have a question just by

2072
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,490
 

2073
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:34,350
 volunteering everyone wants to get

2074
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,350
 

2075
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:37,440
 called when they have a question right

2076
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:37,440
 

2077
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:40,500
 you get to be that person by by being

2078
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:40,500
 

2079
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:42,450
 continually helpful and constructive in

2080
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:42,450
 

2081
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:44,310
 dealing with them over time so I think

2082
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:44,310
 

2083
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:47,070
 engagement over time is really the only

2084
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:47,070
 

2085
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:50,220
 way to do it and you can do that in a

2086
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:50,220
 

2087
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:53,220
 local way you can do that by trying to

2088
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:53,220
 

2089
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:56,070
 ensure that organizations or or

2090
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:56,070
 

2091
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:58,680
 companies with which you're involved

2092
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:58,680
 

2093
00:48:56,070 --> 00:49:02,100
 have a presence and use that presence in

2094
00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:02,100
 

2095
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:03,780
 a way that is constructive and deals

2096
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:03,780
 

2097
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:05,070
 with the broad issues and not just the

2098
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:05,070
 

2099
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:07,680
 sort of narrow self-interest of the

2100
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:07,680
 

2101
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:09,390
 organization but there is no shortcut it

2102
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:09,390
 

2103
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:13,290
 requires a lot of work in engagement

2104
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:13,290
 

2105
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:15,840
 over time so you said earlier that we

2106
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,840
 

2107
00:49:13,290 --> 00:49:17,190
 shouldn't appoint ourselves as gods to

2108
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:17,190
 

2109
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:18,690
 make decisions but actually in other

2110
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:18,690
 

2111
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:21,030
 industries that's exactly what they do

2112
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:21,030
 

2113
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:23,670
 so at various times in my career I've

2114
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:23,670
 

2115
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:25,800
 had to be registered take registration

2116
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:25,800
 

2117
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:27,990
 exams with FINRA which is the financial

2118
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:27,990
 

2119
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:30,660
 industry self-regulatory organization in

2120
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:30,660
 

2121
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:33,150
 the US and which has a statutory role

2122
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:33,150
 

2123
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:34,620
 and similarly the municipal securities

2124
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:34,620
 

2125
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:37,620
 rulemaking board in the American

2126
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:37,620
 

2127
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:41,070
 Arbitration Association are statutorily

2128
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:41,070
 

2129
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:42,360
 recognized SROs and then there are those

2130
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:42,360
 

2131
00:49:41,070 --> 00:49:45,140
 like the National Association of

2132
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:45,140
 

2133
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:47,760
 Realtors which manage to effectively

2134
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:47,760
 

2135
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:49,890
 control self-regulation by controlling

2136
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:49,890
 

2137
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:52,470
 access to important resources such as

2138
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:52,470
 

2139
00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:54,780
 multiple listing services and one of the

2140
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:54,780
 

2141
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:56,190
 reasons that industry groups will often

2142
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:56,190
 

2143
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:59,220
 set these up is so that they can

2144
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:59,220
 

2145
00:49:56,190 --> 00:50:01,140
 forestall government regulation by you

2146
00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:01,140
 

2147
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:03,030
 know making sure that the regulatory

2148
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:03,030
 

2149
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:04,500
 decisions are controlled by people you

2150
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:04,500
 

2151
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:06,210
 know who understand the industry who

2152
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:06,210
 

2153
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:08,640
 have the industry's best interests at

2154
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,640
 

2155
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:10,680
 heart a bidder or you know willing to

2156
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,680
 

2157
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:12,960
 also you know regulate in the public's

2158
00:50:10,670 --> 00:50:12,960
 

2159
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:15,570
 interest as well so you know that's why

2160
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:15,570
 

2161
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:17,250
 there's a lot of effort made by FINRA to

2162
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,250
 

2163
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:19,500
 to make sure that you don't have

2164
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:19,500
 

2165
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:20,820
 individual bad actor security dealers

2166
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:20,820
 

2167
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:23,220
 and I mean in the case of resource

2168
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:23,220
 

2169
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:25,500
 restrictions for an example you know

2170
00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:25,500
 

2171
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:28,310
 potentially we could get datasets by

2172
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:28,310
 

2173
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:29,900
 access to data set by membership or

2174
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:29,900
 

2175
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:31,700
 or if people want to buy lots of cloud

2176
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:31,700
 

2177
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:33,110
 resources or GPUs at some point they get

2178
00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:33,110
 

2179
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:34,880
 encouraged to join the self-regulatory

2180
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:34,880
 

2181
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:39,470
 organization so I think that could be

2182
00:50:34,870 --> 00:50:39,470
 

2183
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:40,940
 yeah so self-regulation is is an

2184
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:40,940
 

2185
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:42,710
 interesting approach it's used in a

2186
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:42,710
 

2187
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:48,140
 bunch of sectors and when it's working

2188
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:48,140
 

2189
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:52,780
 well it basically serves as when it's

2190
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:52,780
 

2191
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:56,180
 working well it remains accountable to

2192
00:50:52,770 --> 00:50:56,180
 

2193
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:58,340
 to the public at least indirectly right

2194
00:50:56,170 --> 00:50:58,340
 

2195
00:50:56,180 --> 00:51:00,800
 a lot of what happens especially when

2196
00:50:58,330 --> 00:51:00,800
 

2197
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:05,090
 you're making detail especially when

2198
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:05,090
 

2199
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:07,910
 detailed rules are being made for in

2200
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,910
 

2201
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:12,320
 very complex settings is delegation to

2202
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:12,320
 

2203
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:14,330
 some kind of expert body and the and the

2204
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:14,330
 

2205
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:15,980
 and the governance challenge there is

2206
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,980
 

2207
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:18,620
 how to make sure that that expert body

2208
00:51:15,970 --> 00:51:18,620
 

2209
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:21,530
 is accountable and so self-regulatory

2210
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:21,530
 

2211
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:23,180
 organizations when this is process is

2212
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,180
 

2213
00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:25,700
 working well are accountable in the

2214
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:25,700
 

2215
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:28,070
 sense that if they are not sufficiently

2216
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:28,070
 

2217
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:29,360
 responsive to the public interest then

2218
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:29,360
 

2219
00:51:28,070 --> 00:51:31,430
 they will be replaced by something

2220
00:51:29,350 --> 00:51:31,430
 

2221
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:33,380
 that's not self-regulating Latorre and

2222
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:33,380
 

2223
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:38,180
 it's very common for policy makers to

2224
00:51:33,370 --> 00:51:38,180
 

2225
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:39,410
 say you sector industry go off figure

2226
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:39,410
 

2227
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:41,300
 out how to deal with this challenge

2228
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,300
 

2229
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:44,380
 because if you don't come up with a good

2230
00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:44,380
 

2231
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:46,850
 solution we'll have to impose one and so

2232
00:51:44,370 --> 00:51:46,850
 

2233
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:49,100
 the fact that it's done by a private

2234
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,100
 

2235
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:51,470
 party doesn't necessarily mean there's a

2236
00:51:49,090 --> 00:51:51,470
 

2237
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:52,640
 lack of accountability it the key

2238
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:52,640
 

2239
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:57,320
 question is how to make sure those

2240
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:57,320
 

2241
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:59,870
 things remain accountable I'm sorry we

2242
00:51:57,310 --> 00:51:59,870
 

2243
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:02,660
 need to we need to get more people so

2244
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:02,660
 

2245
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:04,610
 thank you very much I spent four years

2246
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:04,610
 

2247
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:07,400
 as a congressional staffer in the 90s

2248
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,400
 

2249
00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:09,950
 and everything you said resonated with

2250
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:09,950
 

2251
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:12,860
 what my own experience was and you said

2252
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:12,860
 

2253
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:13,610
 it much better and more fully than I've

2254
00:52:12,850 --> 00:52:13,610
 

2255
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:16,250
 ever heard before

2256
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:16,250
 

2257
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:17,900
 um one of the comments you made you

2258
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,900
 

2259
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:20,450
 mentioned the u.s. digital service as

2260
00:52:17,890 --> 00:52:20,450
 

2261
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:22,280
 one example of a way that that

2262
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,280
 

2263
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:24,200
 technologists could get directly

2264
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:24,200
 

2265
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:26,120
 involved in government I wonder if you

2266
00:52:24,190 --> 00:52:26,120
 

2267
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:28,220
 can mention some other specific examples

2268
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:28,220
 

2269
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:31,490
 just to give people a sense of the broad

2270
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:31,490
 

2271
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:33,080
 range of roles sure and I'm more

2272
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:33,080
 

2273
00:52:31,490 --> 00:52:35,780
 familiar with the US than anywhere else

2274
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:35,780
 

2275
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:40,600
 so apologies to my non-us colleagues

2276
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:40,600
 

2277
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:42,980
 here so there are groups of

2278
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:42,980
 

2279
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:45,200
 allow technologists to come in

2280
00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:45,200
 

2281
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:47,420
 temporarily and practice engineering

2282
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:47,420
 

2283
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:49,400
 against some of the hardest public

2284
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:49,400
 

2285
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:51,920
 problems in the u.s. that's the u.s.

2286
00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:51,920
 

2287
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:55,310
 digital service it's groups like 18f and

2288
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:55,310
 

2289
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:57,619
 the technology transformation program at

2290
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:57,619
 

2291
00:52:55,310 --> 00:53:00,080
 the General Services Administration but

2292
00:52:57,609 --> 00:53:00,080
 

2293
00:52:57,619 --> 00:53:03,619
 also there are innovation groups and

2294
00:53:00,070 --> 00:53:03,619
 

2295
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:08,119
 CTOs in now in a lot of federal

2296
00:53:03,609 --> 00:53:08,119
 

2297
00:53:03,619 --> 00:53:10,220
 government settings States and large

2298
00:53:08,109 --> 00:53:10,220
 

2299
00:53:08,119 --> 00:53:12,050
 cities also have chief innovation

2300
00:53:10,210 --> 00:53:12,050
 

2301
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:14,090
 officers or chief technology officers

2302
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:14,090
 

2303
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:16,790
 those are often places with high

2304
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:16,790
 

2305
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:19,160
 leverage they're also fellowships that

2306
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:19,160
 

2307
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:21,410
 where one can go and work in Congress or

2308
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:21,410
 

2309
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:22,700
 an executive branch agencies I think the

2310
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,700
 

2311
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:24,350
 most important thing if you're

2312
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:24,350
 

2313
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:30,470
 interested in this is figuring out how

2314
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:30,470
 

2315
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:32,840
 to get in the room hello I totally agree

2316
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:32,840
 

2317
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:35,480
 with you about that we need to get out

2318
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:35,480
 

2319
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:38,450
 of our labs and and understand how our

2320
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:38,450
 

2321
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:40,730
 government works and get engaged but I

2322
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:40,730
 

2323
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:44,200
 also want to add that we have another

2324
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:44,200
 

2325
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:48,380
 duty at that's educating the public and

2326
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:48,380
 

2327
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:50,390
 educating the people under charge in a

2328
00:53:48,370 --> 00:53:50,390
 

2329
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:53,270
 simple way basically to get a common

2330
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:53,270
 

2331
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:55,520
 ground because I see there is a lot of

2332
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:55,520
 

2333
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:58,100
 misconception now if you hear the radio

2334
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:58,100
 

2335
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:59,980
 and TV that there is a lot of talk about

2336
00:53:58,090 --> 00:53:59,980
 

2337
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:01,520
 artificial intelligence which

2338
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:01,520
 

2339
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:04,910
 necessarily not true

2340
00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:04,910
 

2341
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:07,280
 so I just wanted to know your your

2342
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:07,280
 

2343
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:09,950
 opinion about data - this is absolutely

2344
00:54:07,270 --> 00:54:09,950
 

2345
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:12,109
 right one of the aspects of the

2346
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:12,109
 

2347
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:14,630
 algorithm of democracy I talked about is

2348
00:54:12,099 --> 00:54:14,630
 

2349
00:54:12,109 --> 00:54:17,480
 that you make decisions by voting but

2350
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:17,480
 

2351
00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:19,310
 those decisions are shaped by the public

2352
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:19,310
 

2353
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:21,020
 discourse that happens beforehand and

2354
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,020
 

2355
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:22,450
 although I didn't talk about it much in

2356
00:54:21,010 --> 00:54:22,450
 

2357
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:25,850
 this talk I agree with you absolutely

2358
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:25,850
 

2359
00:54:22,450 --> 00:54:27,470
 that participating in a positive and

2360
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,470
 

2361
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:29,540
 constructive way in that public

2362
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:29,540
 

2363
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:31,810
 discourse and making sure that the

2364
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:31,810
 

2365
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:36,020
 public discourse around these issues is

2366
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:36,020
 

2367
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:39,650
 is really healthy and well informed is

2368
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:39,650
 

2369
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:41,570
 is extremely important and there and

2370
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:41,570
 

2371
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:45,380
 there is an important kind of career

2372
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:45,380
 

2373
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:47,390
 path there as well just as we've seen in

2374
00:54:45,370 --> 00:54:47,390
 

2375
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:50,450
 science communication about physical

2376
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:50,450
 

2377
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:52,190
 science for example there are people who

2378
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,190
 

2379
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:53,300
 have played a really important role in

2380
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:53,300
 

2381
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:55,040
 helping the gut

2382
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,040
 

2383
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:59,240
 public understand what's going on I

2384
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:59,240
 

2385
00:54:55,040 --> 00:55:00,530
 think that space exists in our field as

2386
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:00,530
 

2387
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:03,110
 well and it's really important that

2388
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:03,110
 

2389
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:04,430
 people do it well and I'm being told I'm

2390
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:04,430
 

2391
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:07,010
 out of time I'm so sorry

2392
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:07,010
 

2393
00:55:04,430 --> 00:55:07,930
 I'd be happy to talk to others afterward

2394
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:07,930
 

2395
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:17,020
 thank you

2396
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:17,020
 

2397
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:17,020
[Applause]

2398
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:24,850
 

2399
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:31,230
 great well thank you for that fantastic

2400
00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:31,230
 

2401
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:33,930
 talk Edie so next up we have the test of

2402
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:33,930
 

2403
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:35,580
 time award and here to present the ward

2404
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,580
 

2405
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:38,070
 and talk a little bit about why this

2406
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:38,070
 

2407
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:42,270
 paper was chosen is Arthur Gratton from

2408
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:42,270
 

2409
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:45,030
 the test of time award committee yeah

2410
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:45,030
 

2411
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:46,619
 sir Thank You Hannah um so I'm here to

2412
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:46,619
 

2413
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:48,119
 present the test of time award actually

2414
00:55:46,609 --> 00:55:48,119
 

2415
00:55:46,619 --> 00:55:50,790
 with one of my co committee members

2416
00:55:48,109 --> 00:55:50,790
 

2417
00:55:48,119 --> 00:55:53,910
 Shabba and on behalf of the larger

2418
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:53,910
 

2419
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:55,950
 committee so the award this year goes to

2420
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:55,950
 

2421
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:59,160
 the paper the trade offs of logical

2422
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:59,160
 

2423
00:55:55,950 --> 00:56:01,860
 learning by Leon bow to Olivier brewski

2424
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:01,860
 

2425
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:04,890
 so it turns out being from the tests of

2426
00:56:01,850 --> 00:56:04,890
 

2427
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:06,750
 time committee is is very hard as I

2428
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,750
 

2429
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:09,060
 discovered so we had a month of a very

2430
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:09,060
 

2431
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:12,060
 vigorous email debate I think it went to

2432
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:12,060
 

2433
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:14,250
 something like 20-30 pages there were so

2434
00:56:12,050 --> 00:56:14,250
 

2435
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:16,260
 many amazing papers to choose from and

2436
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,260
 

2437
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:19,380
 and it was a real privilege to reread

2438
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:19,380
 

2439
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:22,770
 some of the papers from 10 years ago and

2440
00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:22,770
 

2441
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:24,390
 to see some of the work done so we did

2442
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:24,390
 

2443
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:27,480
 have an exceptionally tough time

2444
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:27,480
 

2445
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:29,040
 choosing among the leading papers all of

2446
00:56:27,470 --> 00:56:29,040
 

2447
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:31,109
 them had strengths in in different areas

2448
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:31,109
 

2449
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:34,320
 and an outsized impact in their

2450
00:56:31,099 --> 00:56:34,320
 

2451
00:56:31,109 --> 00:56:38,010
 respective disciplines so it was a real

2452
00:56:34,310 --> 00:56:38,010
 

2453
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:41,160
 education to see what had been done so

2454
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,160
 

2455
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:43,380
 this brings us to this year's award so

2456
00:56:41,150 --> 00:56:43,380
 

2457
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:46,590
 if we rewind to the state of machine

2458
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:46,590
 

2459
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:48,750
 learning theory back in 2008 the

2460
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:48,750
 

2461
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:50,700
 discussion was about trading off to

2462
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:50,700
 

2463
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:52,800
 sources of error estimation error which

2464
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:52,800
 

2465
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:54,960
 arose from having a limited number of

2466
00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:54,960
 

2467
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:56,490
 samples an approximation error which

2468
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:56,490
 

2469
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:59,430
 arose because our learning algorithms

2470
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,430
 

2471
00:56:56,490 --> 00:57:01,920
 were simple in some sense but you know

2472
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:01,920
 

2473
00:56:59,430 --> 00:57:04,859
 as far as solving these learning

2474
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:04,859
 

2475
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:06,090
 problems was concerned as long as we

2476
00:57:04,849 --> 00:57:06,090
 

2477
00:57:04,859 --> 00:57:09,210
 were prepared to solve it in polynomial

2478
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:09,210
 

2479
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:11,369
 time you were good but then you know

2480
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,369
 

2481
00:57:09,210 --> 00:57:13,380
 this is fine if you're in the limited

2482
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:13,380
 

2483
00:57:11,369 --> 00:57:14,700
 data and unlimited time scenario in

2484
00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:14,700
 

2485
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:16,770
 modern machine learning we have

2486
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:16,770
 

2487
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:20,100
 unlimited data that we have limited time

2488
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:20,100
 

2489
00:57:16,770 --> 00:57:22,619
 so what do we do so in this case we

2490
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:22,619
 

2491
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:24,450
 can't you know minimize empirical error

2492
00:57:22,609 --> 00:57:24,450
 

2493
00:57:22,619 --> 00:57:27,750
 exactly we have to minimize it

2494
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:27,750
 

2495
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:28,800
 approximately and that causes a third

2496
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:28,800
 

2497
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:31,170
 source of error

2498
00:57:28,790 --> 00:57:31,170
 

2499
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:32,820
 being optimization error so then how do

2500
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,820
 

2501
00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:35,160
 you trade off now these three sources of

2502
00:57:32,810 --> 00:57:35,160
 

2503
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:38,550
 error estimation approximation and

2504
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:38,550
 

2505
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:41,580
 optimization so this is where this paper

2506
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:41,580
 

2507
00:57:38,550 --> 00:57:43,440
 really had the pioneering result it was

2508
00:57:41,570 --> 00:57:43,440
 

2509
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:45,090
 the first rigorous analysis of the

2510
00:57:43,430 --> 00:57:45,090
 

2511
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:47,160
 trade-off of these three sources of

2512
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:47,160
 

2513
00:57:45,090 --> 00:57:49,200
 error and one of the results that it

2514
00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:49,200
 

2515
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:50,910
 showed which I think is relevant to this

2516
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:50,910
 

2517
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:53,640
 day is that stochastic gradient descent

2518
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:53,640
 

2519
00:57:50,910 --> 00:57:55,650
 is a good choice in achieving a good

2520
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:55,650
 

2521
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:57,600
 balance between these three sources of

2522
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,600
 

2523
00:57:55,650 --> 00:58:00,810
 error in the large sample regime which

2524
00:57:57,590 --> 00:58:00,810
 

2525
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:02,280
 is where we live so this remains a

2526
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,280
 

2527
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:04,260
 really lively area of research today

2528
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,260
 

2529
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:06,930
 trade-off between optimization

2530
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:06,930
 

2531
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:10,830
 approximation and estimation is one of

2532
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:10,830
 

2533
00:58:06,930 --> 00:58:12,030
 the I think most you know necessary and

2534
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,030
 

2535
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:14,850
 important questions that we should

2536
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:14,850
 

2537
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:16,740
 continue to ask ourselves and this paper

2538
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,740
 

2539
00:58:14,850 --> 00:58:19,080
 really was the first rigorous effort in

2540
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:19,080
 

2541
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:21,420
 that direction it's made a large and

2542
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:21,420
 

2543
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:24,720
 lasting impact in the field and for this

2544
00:58:21,410 --> 00:58:24,720
 

2545
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:27,780
 reason we decided to award the test of

2546
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:27,780
 

2547
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:31,340
 time award to this paper so what do you

2548
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:31,340
 

2549
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:31,340
 get if you can come up

2550
00:58:31,650 --> 00:58:31,650
 

2551
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:43,620
[Applause]

2552
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:00,780
 

2553
00:59:00,790 --> 00:59:07,550
 working

2554
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:07,550
 

2555
00:59:03,390 --> 00:59:10,650
 yes all right good morning everybody

2556
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:10,650
 

2557
00:59:07,550 --> 00:59:12,840
 it's actually very intimidating to be

2558
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,840
 

2559
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:14,520
 here the room is getting bigger every

2560
00:59:12,830 --> 00:59:14,520
 

2561
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:18,630
 year it's not only much bigger than it

2562
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:18,630
 

2563
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:20,490
 was in 2007 and it's very humbling to

2564
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:20,490
 

2565
00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:22,680
 receive such an award and especially

2566
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,680
 

2567
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:26,700
 knowing how fierce was the competition

2568
00:59:22,670 --> 00:59:26,700
 

2569
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:28,890
 to to be here and unfortunately my

2570
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:28,890
 

2571
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:30,690
 quarterly on bo2 who is actually the

2572
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,690
 

2573
00:59:28,890 --> 00:59:32,820
 first author of this work and thus

2574
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:32,820
 

2575
00:59:30,690 --> 00:59:33,770
 deserves most of the credit could not

2576
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:33,770
 

2577
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:36,270
 make it today

2578
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:36,270
 

2579
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:38,910
 it turns out that in his own words he

2580
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:38,910
 

2581
00:59:36,270 --> 00:59:42,270
 said I owe more to my family than I owe

2582
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:42,270
 

2583
00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:44,460
 to my vanity and certainly I cannot

2584
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:44,460
 

2585
00:59:42,270 --> 00:59:46,890
 blame him for getting his priorities

2586
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:46,890
 

2587
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:50,450
 right but you know in order to take care

2588
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:50,450
 

2589
00:59:46,890 --> 00:59:50,450
 of his vanity let me show you

2590
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:50,620
 

2591
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:57,400
 so

2592
00:59:52,070 --> 00:59:57,400
 

2593
00:59:52,080 --> 01:00:00,860
[Applause]

2594
00:59:57,390 --> 01:00:00,860
 

2595
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:01,730
 so you have me and I will do my best to

2596
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:01,730
 

2597
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:05,690
 represent him

2598
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:05,690
 

2599
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:07,910
 of course so you know as all stories in

2600
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,910
 

2601
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:09,980
 computer science at least they go back

2602
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:09,980
 

2603
01:00:07,910 --> 01:00:13,580
 all the way to the 50s and actually this

2604
01:00:09,970 --> 01:00:13,580
 

2605
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:15,950
 works in particular you can trace its

2606
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:15,950
 

2607
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:18,850
 roots to you know somewhere around the

2608
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:18,850
 

2609
01:00:15,950 --> 01:00:21,650
 early 50s where there was the work of

2610
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:21,650
 

2611
01:00:18,850 --> 01:00:23,330
 Robinson Munroe on stochastic or and

2612
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:23,330
 

2613
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:25,190
 incense but I won't go back all the way

2614
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:25,190
 

2615
01:00:23,330 --> 01:00:29,000
 to that time I will start my story in

2616
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:29,000
 

2617
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:30,200
 2003 so 2003 I was organizing this

2618
01:00:28,990 --> 01:00:30,200
 

2619
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:33,110
 machine learning summer school in

2620
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:33,110
 

2621
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:34,580
 Tuebingen and you know this was the time

2622
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:34,580
 

2623
01:00:33,110 --> 01:00:37,400
 if you remember well you'd probably

2624
01:00:34,570 --> 01:00:37,400
 

2625
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:40,100
 don't remember because most of you were

2626
01:00:37,390 --> 01:00:40,100
 

2627
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:42,070
 not there at the time probably in

2628
01:00:40,090 --> 01:00:42,070
 

2629
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:44,210
 machine learning at least so at the time

2630
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:44,210
 

2631
01:00:42,070 --> 01:00:47,480
 support vector machines and kernel

2632
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:47,480
 

2633
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:50,300
 machines were all the rage and so Leon

2634
01:00:47,470 --> 01:00:50,300
 

2635
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:52,790
 came to give a lecture and surprisingly

2636
01:00:50,290 --> 01:00:52,790
 

2637
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:54,370
 maybe or you know it felt a bit weird at

2638
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:54,370
 

2639
01:00:52,790 --> 01:00:57,350
 the time because he was talking about an

2640
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:57,350
 

2641
01:00:54,370 --> 01:00:59,150
 algorithm that was that felt a bit

2642
01:00:57,340 --> 01:00:59,150
 

2643
01:00:57,350 --> 01:01:01,730
 outdated it talked about stochastic

2644
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:01,730
 

2645
01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:03,770
 gradient and he was advocating using

2646
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:03,770
 

2647
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:05,390
 this algorithm in SVM when everyone else

2648
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,390
 

2649
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:07,460
 was doing quadratic programming and

2650
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:07,460
 

2651
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:09,410
 conjugate gradient descent and things

2652
01:01:07,450 --> 01:01:09,410
 

2653
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:11,990
 like that so it failed to be surprising

2654
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,990
 

2655
01:01:09,410 --> 01:01:14,060
 and but he had this very interesting

2656
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:14,060
 

2657
01:01:11,990 --> 01:01:15,910
 thought experiment he said like imagine

2658
01:01:14,050 --> 01:01:15,910
 

2659
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:19,370
 that your dataset contains lots of

2660
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:19,370
 

2661
01:01:15,910 --> 01:01:20,780
 examples that are duplicated then if you

2662
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:20,780
 

2663
01:01:19,370 --> 01:01:22,190
 do stochastic Renison that means you

2664
01:01:20,770 --> 01:01:22,190
 

2665
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:24,380
 process one at a time and you do a grade

2666
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:24,380
 

2667
01:01:22,190 --> 01:01:26,150
 and step so even on those duplicate an

2668
01:01:24,370 --> 01:01:26,150
 

2669
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:28,400
 example you will make gradient step so

2670
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:28,400
 

2671
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:30,950
 you will move forward whereas if you do

2672
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:30,950
 

2673
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:32,570
 batch learning then you will compute the

2674
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:32,570
 

2675
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:35,420
 same gradient many many times and apply

2676
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:35,420
 

2677
01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:37,220
 it only once at the end of the batch so

2678
01:01:35,410 --> 01:01:37,220
 

2679
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:39,140
 you will waste a lot of computation and

2680
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:39,140
 

2681
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:40,640
 that was his argument for saying that

2682
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:40,640
 

2683
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:42,950
 you know maybe stochastic adenosine

2684
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:42,950
 

2685
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:44,540
 should be considered he also had this

2686
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:44,540
 

2687
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:47,000
 very nice picture that I remember

2688
01:01:44,530 --> 01:01:47,000
 

2689
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:49,220
 captivated me and and I thought this is

2690
01:01:46,990 --> 01:01:49,220
 

2691
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:51,740
 really the essence if you look at the

2692
01:01:49,210 --> 01:01:51,740
 

2693
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:55,280
 parameter space when you do when you

2694
01:01:51,730 --> 01:01:55,280
 

2695
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:57,260
 start at w1 and you do online or

2696
01:01:55,270 --> 01:01:57,260
 

2697
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:59,600
 stochastic gradient you make these small

2698
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:59,600
 

2699
01:01:57,260 --> 01:02:01,940
 steps so you don't make too much

2700
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:01,940
 

2701
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:03,440
 progress but you you're constantly going

2702
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:03,440
 

2703
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:05,420
 in the direction of the true solution

2704
01:02:03,430 --> 01:02:05,420
 

2705
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:08,660
 the solution being the you know the

2706
01:02:05,410 --> 01:02:08,660
 

2707
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:09,410
 optimal W for the test error whereas if

2708
01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:09,410
 

2709
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:12,289
 you do batch

2710
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:12,289
 

2711
01:02:09,410 --> 01:02:14,920
 updates or you do batch gradient descent

2712
01:02:12,279 --> 01:02:14,920
 

2713
01:02:12,289 --> 01:02:17,509
 let's say you will make faster progress

2714
01:02:14,910 --> 01:02:17,509
 

2715
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:20,869
 but towards a solution which is the best

2716
01:02:17,499 --> 01:02:20,869
 

2717
01:02:17,509 --> 01:02:22,849
 in training error so either you go you

2718
01:02:20,859 --> 01:02:22,849
 

2719
01:02:20,869 --> 01:02:24,950
 know straight to the best solution in

2720
01:02:22,839 --> 01:02:24,950
 

2721
01:02:22,849 --> 01:02:26,930
 training error or you go slowly to the

2722
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:26,930
 

2723
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:29,599
 best solution in tester what should you

2724
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:29,599
 

2725
01:02:26,930 --> 01:02:31,009
 choose right either you go fast to the

2726
01:02:29,589 --> 01:02:31,009
 

2727
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:33,289
 solution that is not necessarily one you

2728
01:02:30,999 --> 01:02:33,289
 

2729
01:02:31,009 --> 01:02:35,930
 want or slow to the solution you want

2730
01:02:33,279 --> 01:02:35,930
 

2731
01:02:33,289 --> 01:02:37,309
 and I felt at the time there there there

2732
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,309
 

2733
01:02:35,930 --> 01:02:39,799
 should be a way to characterize that

2734
01:02:37,299 --> 01:02:39,799
 

2735
01:02:37,309 --> 01:02:42,499
 more formally and to quantify it in

2736
01:02:39,789 --> 01:02:42,499
 

2737
01:02:39,799 --> 01:02:44,930
 particular even at this picture that

2738
01:02:42,489 --> 01:02:44,930
 

2739
01:02:42,499 --> 01:02:47,390
 showed that interestingly this

2740
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:47,390
 

2741
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:50,150
 difference between you know the best

2742
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:50,150
 

2743
01:02:47,390 --> 01:02:51,950
 stochastic gradient or the point at

2744
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:51,950
 

2745
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:54,259
 which you reach with stochastic gradient

2746
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:54,259
 

2747
01:02:51,950 --> 01:02:56,180
 and the truer is actually the same

2748
01:02:54,249 --> 01:02:56,180
 

2749
01:02:54,259 --> 01:02:58,279
 distance roughly speaking as the

2750
01:02:56,170 --> 01:02:58,279
 

2751
01:02:56,180 --> 01:03:02,059
 difference between the test and training

2752
01:02:58,269 --> 01:03:02,059
 

2753
01:02:58,279 --> 01:03:04,369
 error and so he concluded his talk or

2754
01:03:02,049 --> 01:03:04,369
 

2755
01:03:02,059 --> 01:03:07,369
 its lecture by saying that stochastic

2756
01:03:04,359 --> 01:03:07,369
 

2757
01:03:04,369 --> 01:03:08,720
 algorithm can become attractive in the

2758
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:08,720
 

2759
01:03:07,369 --> 01:03:10,970
 regime where you will have large amounts

2760
01:03:08,710 --> 01:03:10,970
 

2761
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:13,969
 of data and that was really at the time

2762
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,969
 

2763
01:03:10,970 --> 01:03:17,469
 more an intuition you know than done a

2764
01:03:13,959 --> 01:03:17,469
 

2765
01:03:13,969 --> 01:03:21,170
 real theorem or something really formal

2766
01:03:17,459 --> 01:03:21,170
 

2767
01:03:17,469 --> 01:03:25,099
 but then you know we both went back to

2768
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:25,099
 

2769
01:03:21,170 --> 01:03:29,450
 our other projects and kernel machines

2770
01:03:25,089 --> 01:03:29,450
 

2771
01:03:25,099 --> 01:03:31,219
 in particular and until 2006 where they

2772
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,219
 

2773
01:03:29,450 --> 01:03:34,009
 only did this book large-scale kernel

2774
01:03:31,209 --> 01:03:34,009
 

2775
01:03:31,219 --> 01:03:36,890
 machines where it was a bunch of papers

2776
01:03:33,999 --> 01:03:36,890
 

2777
01:03:34,009 --> 01:03:39,200
 about trying to scale up kernel machines

2778
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:39,200
 

2779
01:03:36,890 --> 01:03:40,969
 to larger data set and in there if you

2780
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:40,969
 

2781
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:43,339
 look at the introduction there was this

2782
01:03:40,959 --> 01:03:43,339
 

2783
01:03:40,969 --> 01:03:45,319
 this proposal of a framework for

2784
01:03:43,329 --> 01:03:45,319
 

2785
01:03:43,339 --> 01:03:46,940
 studying the large-scale regime which

2786
01:03:45,309 --> 01:03:46,940
 

2787
01:03:45,319 --> 01:03:48,559
 was you know this decomposition that

2788
01:03:46,930 --> 01:03:48,559
 

2789
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:50,450
 after mentioned in approximation

2790
01:03:48,549 --> 01:03:50,450
 

2791
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:53,630
 estimation and optimization error and

2792
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:53,630
 

2793
01:03:50,450 --> 01:03:54,819
 this this formulation of the difference

2794
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:54,819
 

2795
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:57,019
 between small-scale and large-scale

2796
01:03:54,809 --> 01:03:57,019
 

2797
01:03:54,819 --> 01:03:59,719
 small-scale peeling that your millimetre

2798
01:03:57,009 --> 01:03:59,719
 

2799
01:03:57,019 --> 01:04:02,119
 by the training set size whereas in the

2800
01:03:59,709 --> 01:04:02,119
 

2801
01:03:59,719 --> 01:04:04,519
 large case regime you have lots of data

2802
01:04:02,109 --> 01:04:04,519
 

2803
01:04:02,119 --> 01:04:06,670
 but you're limited by the computational

2804
01:04:04,509 --> 01:04:06,670
 

2805
01:04:04,519 --> 01:04:11,660
 power available or the time that you're

2806
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:11,660
 

2807
01:04:06,670 --> 01:04:13,249
 willing to spend and more or less at the

2808
01:04:11,650 --> 01:04:13,249
 

2809
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:15,410
 same time people were starting to

2810
01:04:13,239 --> 01:04:15,410
 

2811
01:04:13,249 --> 01:04:18,769
 experiment with stochastic gradient

2812
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:18,769
 

2813
01:04:15,410 --> 01:04:19,400
 again and in particular in CRFs and in

2814
01:04:18,759 --> 01:04:19,400
 

2815
01:04:18,769 --> 01:04:21,680
 SVM's

2816
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:21,680
 

2817
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:22,850
 and the results were quite surprising

2818
01:04:21,670 --> 01:04:22,850
 

2819
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:24,250
 like it was going

2820
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:24,250
 

2821
01:04:22,850 --> 01:04:27,830
 really really fast compared to the

2822
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:27,830
 

2823
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:30,110
 existing algorithms and so that was it

2824
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:30,110
 

2825
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:32,270
 right like Lyon contacted me and say

2826
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:32,270
 

2827
01:04:30,110 --> 01:04:34,250
 well you know this thing that I was

2828
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:34,250
 

2829
01:04:32,270 --> 01:04:36,500
 showing in tubing and I did remember

2830
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:36,500
 

2831
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:38,270
 very precisely this picture he said

2832
01:04:36,490 --> 01:04:38,270
 

2833
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:41,030
 let's make it formal let's let's write a

2834
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:41,030
 

2835
01:04:38,270 --> 01:04:46,040
 paper about it and I immediately jumped

2836
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:46,040
 

2837
01:04:41,030 --> 01:04:48,950
 in and we wrote this paper in 2007 so

2838
01:04:46,030 --> 01:04:48,950
 

2839
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:51,560
 this is the the abstract really what it

2840
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:51,560
 

2841
01:04:48,950 --> 01:04:53,150
 was is a theoretical paper right like

2842
01:04:51,550 --> 01:04:53,150
 

2843
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:55,960
 there was no experiment in the paper and

2844
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:55,960
 

2845
01:04:53,150 --> 01:04:58,700
 it was presenting that framework

2846
01:04:55,950 --> 01:04:58,700
 

2847
01:04:55,960 --> 01:05:00,620
 formalizing it and analyzing a bunch of

2848
01:04:58,690 --> 01:05:00,620
 

2849
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:02,690
 algorithms in that framework to show

2850
01:05:00,610 --> 01:05:02,690
 

2851
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:04,850
 that indeed stochastic gradient sense

2852
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:04,850
 

2853
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:06,380
 does an advantage when you take into

2854
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:06,380
 

2855
01:05:04,850 --> 01:05:09,950
 account this trade-off between

2856
01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:09,950
 

2857
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:11,960
 optimization and estimation error and so

2858
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:11,960
 

2859
01:05:09,950 --> 01:05:15,080
 you know what we did in this paper was

2860
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:15,080
 

2861
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:18,380
 formalize these different notions and

2862
01:05:15,070 --> 01:05:18,380
 

2863
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:19,790
 then take a very simple case because of

2864
01:05:18,370 --> 01:05:19,790
 

2865
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:21,920
 course if you want to analyze properly

2866
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:21,920
 

2867
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:24,350
 you have to start simple so we you know

2868
01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:24,350
 

2869
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:25,910
 fix the class of function use a linear

2870
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:25,910
 

2871
01:05:24,350 --> 01:05:28,010
 bleep prime matrix class of function

2872
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:28,010
 

2873
01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:29,930
 with a smooth convex loss of course

2874
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,930
 

2875
01:05:28,010 --> 01:05:31,490
 that's very limiting but you know we had

2876
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,490
 

2877
01:05:29,930 --> 01:05:33,620
 to start somewhere and we looked at

2878
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:33,620
 

2879
01:05:31,490 --> 01:05:35,690
 these four different iterative

2880
01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:35,690
 

2881
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:39,440
 optimization algorithms both in the

2882
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:39,440
 

2883
01:05:35,690 --> 01:05:42,830
 stochastic case in the batch case both

2884
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:42,830
 

2885
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:44,840
 first order and second order and so

2886
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:44,840
 

2887
01:05:42,830 --> 01:05:48,580
 here's the picture that that you get

2888
01:05:44,830 --> 01:05:48,580
 

2889
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:51,380
 when you do that if you look at the

2890
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:51,380
 

2891
01:05:48,580 --> 01:05:53,060
 different the amount of iterations that

2892
01:05:51,370 --> 01:05:53,060
 

2893
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:55,640
 you need to perform to reach a certain

2894
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:55,640
 

2895
01:05:53,060 --> 01:05:57,200
 accuracy in the optimization what

2896
01:05:55,630 --> 01:05:57,200
 

2897
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:58,700
 happens is that's gradient descents the

2898
01:05:57,190 --> 01:05:58,700
 

2899
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:00,170
 first two columns

2900
01:05:58,690 --> 01:06:00,170
 

2901
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:01,820
 you know first order and second order

2902
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:01,820
 

2903
01:06:00,170 --> 01:06:04,340
 grading sent are really really fast

2904
01:06:01,810 --> 01:06:04,340
 

2905
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:05,990
 it's like lot 1 over Rho instead of 1

2906
01:06:04,330 --> 01:06:05,990
 

2907
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:07,670
 over Rho for stochastic gradient so you

2908
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:07,670
 

2909
01:06:05,990 --> 01:06:11,450
 you might think ok well it will take

2910
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:11,450
 

2911
01:06:07,670 --> 01:06:14,240
 forever for me to reach any any you know

2912
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:14,240
 

2913
01:06:11,450 --> 01:06:16,340
 correct accuracy for my optimization

2914
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:16,340
 

2915
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:19,640
 algorithm but it turns out that on the

2916
01:06:16,330 --> 01:06:19,640
 

2917
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:21,200
 other hand the iterations themselves are

2918
01:06:19,630 --> 01:06:21,200
 

2919
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:22,880
 much more costly when you do gradient

2920
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:22,880
 

2921
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:24,740
 descent on a batch because you have to

2922
01:06:22,870 --> 01:06:24,740
 

2923
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:27,230
 process the whole batch before making

2924
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:27,230
 

2925
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:29,600
 one iteration whereas in SGD you make a

2926
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:29,600
 

2927
01:06:27,230 --> 01:06:32,660
 step at every time you look at one

2928
01:06:29,590 --> 01:06:32,660
 

2929
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:35,350
 example so if you put dust those two

2930
01:06:32,650 --> 01:06:35,350
 

2931
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:36,940
 things together you get you know

2932
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:36,940
 

2933
01:06:35,350 --> 01:06:39,130
 time or complexity to reach a certain

2934
01:06:36,930 --> 01:06:39,130
 

2935
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:42,370
 accuracy of n log 1 over Rho in the

2936
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:42,370
 

2937
01:06:39,130 --> 01:06:46,120
 gradient case and 1 overall in the SGD

2938
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:46,120
 

2939
01:06:42,370 --> 01:06:47,950
 case but what's interesting is that when

2940
01:06:46,110 --> 01:06:47,950
 

2941
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:50,560
 you take into account the estimation

2942
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:50,560
 

2943
01:06:47,950 --> 01:06:52,210
 error because the point is that there is

2944
01:06:50,550 --> 01:06:52,210
 

2945
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:55,540
 no point in optimizing all the way to

2946
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:55,540
 

2947
01:06:52,210 --> 01:06:58,330
 perfect like zero training error if you

2948
01:06:55,530 --> 01:06:58,330
 

2949
01:06:55,540 --> 01:07:00,520
 have very limited amount of data you

2950
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:00,520
 

2951
01:06:58,330 --> 01:07:02,290
 will have some estimation error that

2952
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:02,290
 

2953
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:04,390
 comes from the fact that the training

2954
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:04,390
 

2955
01:07:02,290 --> 01:07:07,120
 error is not the same as the tester so

2956
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:07,120
 

2957
01:07:04,390 --> 01:07:08,920
 you should you know only optimize to a

2958
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:08,920
 

2959
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:10,450
 certain level which corresponds to the

2960
01:07:08,910 --> 01:07:10,450
 

2961
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:11,890
 size of your estimation error that you

2962
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:11,890
 

2963
01:07:10,450 --> 01:07:13,810
 cannot beat given the data that you have

2964
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:13,810
 

2965
01:07:11,890 --> 01:07:16,480
 available and when you take that into

2966
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:16,480
 

2967
01:07:13,810 --> 01:07:19,270
 account what happens is you get this

2968
01:07:16,470 --> 01:07:19,270
 

2969
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:20,470
 picture where if you compute now not the

2970
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:20,470
 

2971
01:07:19,270 --> 01:07:22,000
 time it takes to get a certain

2972
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:22,000
 

2973
01:07:20,470 --> 01:07:23,580
 optimization error but the time it takes

2974
01:07:21,990 --> 01:07:23,580
 

2975
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,920
 to get a certain overall error

2976
01:07:23,570 --> 01:07:25,920
 

2977
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:28,810
 optimization plus estimation and

2978
01:07:25,910 --> 01:07:28,810
 

2979
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:31,030
 approximation you will get some sense a

2980
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:31,030
 

2981
01:07:28,810 --> 01:07:34,960
 picture that looks like this where SGD

2982
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:34,960
 

2983
01:07:31,030 --> 01:07:37,360
 now is actually better than gradient

2984
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:37,360
 

2985
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:37,900
 descent like to get an error of 1 over

2986
01:07:37,350 --> 01:07:37,900
 

2987
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:40,090
 Epsilon

2988
01:07:37,890 --> 01:07:40,090
 

2989
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:42,520
 it will take your time proportional to 1

2990
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:42,520
 

2991
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:45,130
 over epsilon in SGD whereas in gradient

2992
01:07:42,510 --> 01:07:45,130
 

2993
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:49,150
 descent it will be at least a log factor

2994
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:49,150
 

2995
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:50,980
 worse and possibly even worse depending

2996
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:50,980
 

2997
01:07:49,150 --> 01:07:54,370
 on on the assumptions that you make on

2998
01:07:50,970 --> 01:07:54,370
 

2999
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:57,250
 the on the noise in particular but so

3000
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:57,250
 

3001
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:58,960
 the point and the conclusion is is

3002
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:58,960
 

3003
01:07:57,250 --> 01:08:02,050
 really that you know if you have to

3004
01:07:58,950 --> 01:08:02,050
 

3005
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:04,330
 remember one thing is that if you have

3006
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:04,330
 

3007
01:08:02,050 --> 01:08:06,310
 the possibility of doing so then spend

3008
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:06,310
 

3009
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:08,110
 less time on more data so it's better

3010
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:08,110
 

3011
01:08:06,310 --> 01:08:10,060
 you know to use the time that you have

3012
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:10,060
 

3013
01:08:08,110 --> 01:08:11,650
 the computational time to look at more

3014
01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:11,650
 

3015
01:08:10,060 --> 01:08:13,600
 data and optimize over more data than

3016
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:13,600
 

3017
01:08:11,650 --> 01:08:15,430
 rather than you know taking a small

3018
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:15,430
 

3019
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:19,690
 subset of the data and optimizing more

3020
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:19,690
 

3021
01:08:15,430 --> 01:08:22,180
 and more so this was a theoretical paper

3022
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:22,180
 

3023
01:08:19,690 --> 01:08:24,660
 but interestingly that same year Liam

3024
01:08:22,170 --> 01:08:24,660
 

3025
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:26,830
 was asked to give a tutorial at nips and

3026
01:08:24,650 --> 01:08:26,830
 

3027
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:28,450
 initially on this logical kernel

3028
01:08:26,820 --> 01:08:28,450
 

3029
01:08:26,830 --> 01:08:31,210
 machines but it took the opportunity to

3030
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:31,210
 

3031
01:08:28,450 --> 01:08:32,680
 actually write some code and do some

3032
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:32,680
 

3033
01:08:31,210 --> 01:08:34,660
 experiments that would complement the

3034
01:08:32,670 --> 01:08:34,660
 

3035
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:35,760
 paper so the tutorial ended up being you

3036
01:08:34,650 --> 01:08:35,760
 

3037
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:39,430
 know the presentation of those

3038
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:39,430
 

3039
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:40,840
 experiments and he actually put up this

3040
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:40,840
 

3041
01:08:39,430 --> 01:08:43,930
 this website where you could download

3042
01:08:40,830 --> 01:08:43,930
 

3043
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:46,510
 the code for doing sdd on CRF and SVM's

3044
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:46,510
 

3045
01:08:43,930 --> 01:08:48,250
 and as he was presenting the tutorial in

3046
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:48,250
 

3047
01:08:46,510 --> 01:08:49,660
 the room people were trying it

3048
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:49,660
 

3049
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:52,299
 their laptop and they were amazed that

3050
01:08:49,650 --> 01:08:52,299
 

3051
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:53,740
 it actually works and and there is this

3052
01:08:52,289 --> 01:08:53,740
 

3053
01:08:52,299 --> 01:08:56,770
 phenomenon that indeed stochastic

3054
01:08:53,730 --> 01:08:56,770
 

3055
01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:58,870
 gradient descent is slower but it's

3056
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:58,870
 

3057
01:08:56,770 --> 01:09:00,850
 which is the interesting regime where

3058
01:08:58,860 --> 01:09:00,850
 

3059
01:08:58,870 --> 01:09:03,279
 the optimisation error is close to the

3060
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:03,279
 

3061
01:09:00,850 --> 01:09:05,440
 estimation error much faster than the

3062
01:09:03,269 --> 01:09:05,440
 

3063
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:07,509
 other techniques that eventually get

3064
01:09:05,430 --> 01:09:07,509
 

3065
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:09,970
 much faster to get to a very small

3066
01:09:07,499 --> 01:09:09,970
 

3067
01:09:07,509 --> 01:09:12,750
 accuracy but that's not the point you

3068
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:12,750
 

3069
01:09:09,970 --> 01:09:14,799
 don't need to go all the way there and

3070
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:14,799
 

3071
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:17,529
 this is one slice from that tutorial

3072
01:09:14,789 --> 01:09:17,529
 

3073
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:19,810
 where he was showing experiments on the

3074
01:09:17,519 --> 01:09:19,810
 

3075
01:09:17,529 --> 01:09:22,750
 rightest Reuters dataset on text

3076
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:22,750
 

3077
01:09:19,810 --> 01:09:25,720
 categorization and you can see that to

3078
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:25,720
 

3079
01:09:22,750 --> 01:09:28,660
 get the same test there SGD was taking

3080
01:09:25,710 --> 01:09:28,660
 

3081
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:31,089
 like orders of magnitudes it was order

3082
01:09:28,650 --> 01:09:31,089
 

3083
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:34,920
 of magnitude faster than any other SVM

3084
01:09:31,079 --> 01:09:34,920
 

3085
01:09:31,089 --> 01:09:38,560
 solver at the time and so what happened

3086
01:09:34,910 --> 01:09:38,560
 

3087
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:42,160
 later after this paper went out is that

3088
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:42,160
 

3089
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:44,200
 first you know people tried tried it

3090
01:09:42,150 --> 01:09:44,200
 

3091
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:46,600
 again and confirm the results like

3092
01:09:44,190 --> 01:09:46,600
 

3093
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:49,240
 patrick after for example making some

3094
01:09:46,590 --> 01:09:49,240
 

3095
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:51,580
 experiment of the same nature then for

3096
01:09:49,230 --> 01:09:51,580
 

3097
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:53,620
 example Olivia Chappell who was quite a

3098
01:09:51,570 --> 01:09:53,620
 

3099
01:09:51,580 --> 01:09:56,200
 big fan of conjugate gradient descent

3100
01:09:53,610 --> 01:09:56,200
 

3101
01:09:53,620 --> 01:09:59,200
 and add a very fast implementation of it

3102
01:09:56,190 --> 01:09:59,200
 

3103
01:09:56,200 --> 01:10:00,760
 proposed to run batch gradient descent

3104
01:09:59,190 --> 01:10:00,760
 

3105
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:02,440
 but with smaller batches he said maybe

3106
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:02,440
 

3107
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:04,690
 with smaller batches you get to the same

3108
01:10:02,430 --> 01:10:04,690
 

3109
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:06,820
 performance as SGD but turns out that

3110
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:06,820
 

3111
01:10:04,690 --> 01:10:10,870
 stochastic ran instance was better for

3112
01:10:06,810 --> 01:10:10,870
 

3113
01:10:06,820 --> 01:10:12,610
 any batch size they were also like some

3114
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:12,610
 

3115
01:10:10,870 --> 01:10:14,410
 theoretical follow-ups right afterwards

3116
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,410
 

3117
01:10:12,610 --> 01:10:16,600
 this paper in particular where the

3118
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,600
 

3119
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:19,390
 analysis was refined a little bit to

3120
01:10:16,590 --> 01:10:19,390
 

3121
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:20,340
 take into account the regularization in

3122
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:20,340
 

3123
01:10:19,390 --> 01:10:22,720
 SVM's

3124
01:10:20,330 --> 01:10:22,720
 

3125
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:24,280
 and and then there were three

3126
01:10:22,710 --> 01:10:24,280
 

3127
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:27,640
 essentially three directions in which

3128
01:10:24,270 --> 01:10:27,640
 

3129
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:29,260
 this was pursued one was variance

3130
01:10:27,630 --> 01:10:29,260
 

3131
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:31,450
 reduction stochastic gradient descent as

3132
01:10:29,250 --> 01:10:31,450
 

3133
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:33,190
 this disadvantage that the gradients are

3134
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:33,190
 

3135
01:10:31,450 --> 01:10:36,040
 noisy because you take a random real

3136
01:10:33,180 --> 01:10:36,040
 

3137
01:10:33,190 --> 01:10:37,420
 point at every step so people try to

3138
01:10:36,030 --> 01:10:37,420
 

3139
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:40,480
 reduce this variance by doing some

3140
01:10:37,410 --> 01:10:40,480
 

3141
01:10:37,420 --> 01:10:42,280
 averaging of the gradients it worked

3142
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:42,280
 

3143
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:43,900
 really well in convex optimization but

3144
01:10:42,270 --> 01:10:43,900
 

3145
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:47,470
 it's not clear yet to this point whether

3146
01:10:43,890 --> 01:10:47,470
 

3147
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:50,170
 it's really useful in in the case of

3148
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:50,170
 

3149
01:10:47,470 --> 01:10:52,120
 deep learning for example another

3150
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:52,120
 

3151
01:10:50,170 --> 01:10:53,740
 direction was this notion of implicit

3152
01:10:52,110 --> 01:10:53,740
 

3153
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:55,300
 regularization that's something that the

3154
01:10:53,730 --> 01:10:55,300
 

3155
01:10:53,740 --> 01:10:57,370
 original paper did not take into account

3156
01:10:55,290 --> 01:10:57,370
 

3157
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:59,620
 the fact that if you don't optimize all

3158
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:59,620
 

3159
01:10:57,370 --> 01:11:01,130
 the way then you also have some

3160
01:10:59,610 --> 01:11:01,130
 

3161
01:10:59,620 --> 01:11:04,130
 regularization effect

3162
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:04,130
 

3163
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:06,710
 by the fact that you don't go to search

3164
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:06,710
 

3165
01:11:04,130 --> 01:11:09,710
 the whole space of function and we use

3166
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:09,710
 

3167
01:11:06,710 --> 01:11:12,260
 like worst-case estimation bounds it

3168
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:12,260
 

3169
01:11:09,710 --> 01:11:14,659
 turns out that you can potentially get

3170
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:14,659
 

3171
01:11:12,260 --> 01:11:16,310
 get better if you study this property

3172
01:11:14,649 --> 01:11:16,310
 

3173
01:11:14,659 --> 01:11:18,650
 and that's the this notion of implicit

3174
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:18,650
 

3175
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:21,199
 regularization and and the third

3176
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:21,199
 

3177
01:11:18,650 --> 01:11:23,270
 Direction is the you know trying to make

3178
01:11:21,189 --> 01:11:23,270
 

3179
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:24,920
 this algorithm more robust because they

3180
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:24,920
 

3181
01:11:23,270 --> 01:11:27,860
 are very sensitive to the step size or

3182
01:11:24,910 --> 01:11:27,860
 

3183
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:30,850
 the learning rate and how you change it

3184
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:30,850
 

3185
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:32,989
 over time so many people have tried to

3186
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:32,989
 

3187
01:11:30,850 --> 01:11:36,320
 create algorithms that are more robust

3188
01:11:32,979 --> 01:11:36,320
 

3189
01:11:32,989 --> 01:11:38,630
 to this choice of parameters but really

3190
01:11:36,310 --> 01:11:38,630
 

3191
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:40,880
 the paper ended up being this thing

3192
01:11:38,620 --> 01:11:40,880
 

3193
01:11:38,630 --> 01:11:42,230
 right like an excuse for using SGD in

3194
01:11:40,870 --> 01:11:42,230
 

3195
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:43,820
 some sense like people were saying oh

3196
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:43,820
 

3197
01:11:42,230 --> 01:11:45,860
 well there is this article paper it

3198
01:11:43,810 --> 01:11:45,860
 

3199
01:11:43,820 --> 01:11:48,580
 proves that sgt is better let's just use

3200
01:11:45,850 --> 01:11:48,580
 

3201
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:52,429
 SGD and and forget it

3202
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:52,429
 

3203
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:54,920
 but so you know let me let me give you a

3204
01:11:52,419 --> 01:11:54,920
 

3205
01:11:52,429 --> 01:11:56,960
 few thoughts that are inspired by this

3206
01:11:54,910 --> 01:11:56,960
 

3207
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:58,760
 story the first thing I would say is

3208
01:11:56,950 --> 01:11:58,760
 

3209
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:01,699
 scientific truth doesn't follow fashion

3210
01:11:58,750 --> 01:12:01,699
 

3211
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:04,310
 and you know you should study SGD even

3212
01:12:01,689 --> 01:12:04,310
 

3213
01:12:01,699 --> 01:12:06,679
 if nobody cares about SGD and you know

3214
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:06,679
 

3215
01:12:04,310 --> 01:12:09,350
 the worst thing that can happen to us as

3216
01:12:06,669 --> 01:12:09,350
 

3217
01:12:06,679 --> 01:12:11,300
 a community is that we all start working

3218
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:11,300
 

3219
01:12:09,350 --> 01:12:14,060
 on the same things and we all explore

3220
01:12:11,290 --> 01:12:14,060
 

3221
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:15,440
 the same IDs we need diversity not just

3222
01:12:14,050 --> 01:12:15,440
 

3223
01:12:14,060 --> 01:12:18,489
 in terms of people and cultural

3224
01:12:15,430 --> 01:12:18,489
 

3225
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:22,580
 backgrounds but also in terms of IDs and

3226
01:12:18,479 --> 01:12:22,580
 

3227
01:12:18,489 --> 01:12:25,280
 one way to get to scientific truth is

3228
01:12:22,570 --> 01:12:25,280
 

3229
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:27,739
 through experiments and by experiments I

3230
01:12:25,270 --> 01:12:27,739
 

3231
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:29,630
 don't mean that you know that table that

3232
01:12:27,729 --> 01:12:29,630
 

3233
01:12:27,739 --> 01:12:31,580
 you put at the end of the paper where

3234
01:12:29,620 --> 01:12:31,580
 

3235
01:12:29,630 --> 01:12:33,500
 you magically found the right setup of

3236
01:12:31,570 --> 01:12:33,500
 

3237
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:35,000
 the architecture the parameters and the

3238
01:12:33,490 --> 01:12:35,000
 

3239
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:37,429
 data set on which you can do better than

3240
01:12:34,990 --> 01:12:37,429
 

3241
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:40,190
 you know the baseline or the state of

3242
01:12:37,419 --> 01:12:40,190
 

3243
01:12:37,429 --> 01:12:42,170
 the art what I mean by experiments is in

3244
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:42,170
 

3245
01:12:40,190 --> 01:12:44,449
 the scientific sense of a scientific

3246
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:44,449
 

3247
01:12:42,170 --> 01:12:47,179
 experiment like scientific experiments

3248
01:12:44,439 --> 01:12:47,179
 

3249
01:12:44,449 --> 01:12:49,030
 should help you understand phenomena you

3250
01:12:47,169 --> 01:12:49,030
 

3251
01:12:47,179 --> 01:12:51,560
 should start with the hypothesis and

3252
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:51,560
 

3253
01:12:49,030 --> 01:12:52,850
 perform an experiment or a series of

3254
01:12:51,550 --> 01:12:52,850
 

3255
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:56,270
 experiment to validate or invalidate

3256
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:56,270
 

3257
01:12:52,850 --> 01:12:57,860
 this hypothesis and you know experiment

3258
01:12:56,260 --> 01:12:57,860
 

3259
01:12:56,270 --> 01:12:59,960
 that show that things don't work are

3260
01:12:57,850 --> 01:12:59,960
 

3261
01:12:57,860 --> 01:13:01,790
 just as important and useful as

3262
01:12:59,950 --> 01:13:01,790
 

3263
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:04,630
 experiment that show that things work

3264
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:04,630
 

3265
01:13:01,790 --> 01:13:07,670
 that's something we often forget and

3266
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:07,670
 

3267
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:10,760
 last is you know on the use of

3268
01:13:07,660 --> 01:13:10,760
 

3269
01:13:07,670 --> 01:13:12,980
 mathematics of course tearsa theorems

3270
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:12,980
 

3271
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:15,830
 are here to help us understand again

3272
01:13:12,970 --> 01:13:15,830
 

3273
01:13:12,980 --> 01:13:18,080
 a theorem is not a blank check that you

3274
01:13:15,820 --> 01:13:18,080
 

3275
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:19,580
 know now that there is this theoretical

3276
01:13:18,070 --> 01:13:19,580
 

3277
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:21,590
 guarantee you can go and use this thing

3278
01:13:19,570 --> 01:13:21,590
 

3279
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:23,060
 it's guaranteed to work that's not the

3280
01:13:21,580 --> 01:13:23,060
 

3281
01:13:21,590 --> 01:13:24,170
 case we are dealing with data and there

3282
01:13:23,050 --> 01:13:24,170
 

3283
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:27,590
 are lots of things that serums don't

3284
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:27,590
 

3285
01:13:24,170 --> 01:13:30,800
 capture about our data and the flip side

3286
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:30,800
 

3287
01:13:27,590 --> 01:13:33,890
 of that is that we should not just focus

3288
01:13:30,790 --> 01:13:33,890
 

3289
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:36,440
 our energy on algorithms for which we

3290
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:36,440
 

3291
01:13:33,890 --> 01:13:37,940
 have theoretical guarantees right like

3292
01:13:36,430 --> 01:13:37,940
 

3293
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:40,670
 it's perfectly fine to develop an

3294
01:13:37,930 --> 01:13:40,670
 

3295
01:13:37,940 --> 01:13:43,489
 algorithm prove that it works like with

3296
01:13:40,660 --> 01:13:43,489
 

3297
01:13:40,670 --> 01:13:45,110
 proper experiments and if you don't have

3298
01:13:43,479 --> 01:13:45,110
 

3299
01:13:43,489 --> 01:13:47,840
 a proof for it so be it that's fine

3300
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:47,840
 

3301
01:13:45,110 --> 01:13:49,520
 let's not just you know focus on

3302
01:13:47,830 --> 01:13:49,520
 

3303
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:51,020
 algorithm for which we can prove

3304
01:13:49,510 --> 01:13:51,020
 

3305
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:54,680
 something because it limits our

3306
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:54,680
 

3307
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:56,510
 creativity and so you know to conclude I

3308
01:13:54,670 --> 01:13:56,510
 

3309
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:58,460
 will take this opportunity to present

3310
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:58,460
 

3311
01:13:56,510 --> 01:14:00,890
 maybe three directions of research that

3312
01:13:58,450 --> 01:14:00,890
 

3313
01:13:58,460 --> 01:14:02,960
 I find interesting and promising the

3314
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:02,960
 

3315
01:14:00,890 --> 01:14:04,280
 first one is you know continuing this

3316
01:14:02,950 --> 01:14:04,280
 

3317
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:06,890
 line of research on stochastic gradient

3318
01:14:04,270 --> 01:14:06,890
 

3319
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:08,510
 descent I think we're still far from

3320
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:08,510
 

3321
01:14:06,890 --> 01:14:08,960
 understanding all the subtleties of this

3322
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:08,960
 

3323
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:11,510
 algorithm

3324
01:14:08,950 --> 01:14:11,510
 

3325
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:13,160
 especially when it's combined with deep

3326
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:13,160
 

3327
01:14:11,510 --> 01:14:15,860
 learning and with these networks that

3328
01:14:13,150 --> 01:14:15,860
 

3329
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:19,100
 are largely over parametrized there are

3330
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:19,100
 

3331
01:14:15,860 --> 01:14:21,170
 lots of interesting effects that you

3332
01:14:19,090 --> 01:14:21,170
 

3333
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:24,110
 know tie the over parameterization with

3334
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:24,110
 

3335
01:14:21,170 --> 01:14:26,690
 the stochastic gradient descent to lead

3336
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:26,690
 

3337
01:14:24,110 --> 01:14:30,440
 to interesting generalization the second

3338
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:30,440
 

3339
01:14:26,690 --> 01:14:32,450
 point is we I think we are somewhat

3340
01:14:30,430 --> 01:14:32,450
 

3341
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:34,220
 limited also by this paradigm in which

3342
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:34,220
 

3343
01:14:32,450 --> 01:14:37,489
 the training data is always like the

3344
01:14:34,210 --> 01:14:37,489
 

3345
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:39,860
 test data so you know the test examples

3346
01:14:37,479 --> 01:14:39,860
 

3347
01:14:37,489 --> 01:14:41,660
 are from the same distribution but

3348
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:41,660
 

3349
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:44,510
 really if you think about it as humans

3350
01:14:41,650 --> 01:14:44,510
 

3351
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:47,120
 we learn to do simple things and then we

3352
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:47,120
 

3353
01:14:44,510 --> 01:14:49,880
 are able to perform complex tasks that

3354
01:14:47,110 --> 01:14:49,880
 

3355
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:52,850
 are compositions of those simple tasks

3356
01:14:49,870 --> 01:14:52,850
 

3357
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:54,680
 that we have learned and our models are

3358
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:54,680
 

3359
01:14:52,850 --> 01:14:57,290
 not designed this way with

3360
01:14:54,670 --> 01:14:57,290
 

3361
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:59,000
 compositionality in mind and the same

3362
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:59,000
 

3363
01:14:57,290 --> 01:15:00,560
 thing for our test data sets or

3364
01:14:58,990 --> 01:15:00,560
 

3365
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,880
 benchmarks they are not designed with

3366
01:15:00,550 --> 01:15:01,880
 

3367
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:03,290
 this composition on it in mind I think

3368
01:15:01,870 --> 01:15:03,290
 

3369
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:06,920
 this is a direction that we should

3370
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:06,920
 

3371
01:15:03,290 --> 01:15:09,530
 pursue and and the last one is causality

3372
01:15:06,910 --> 01:15:09,530
 

3373
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:12,500
 as humans we are very good at building

3374
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:12,500
 

3375
01:15:09,530 --> 01:15:15,140
 causal model of the world by interacting

3376
01:15:12,490 --> 01:15:15,140
 

3377
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:17,000
 and observing it and again our models

3378
01:15:15,130 --> 01:15:17,000
 

3379
01:15:15,140 --> 01:15:18,980
 currently don't don't have this this

3380
01:15:16,990 --> 01:15:18,980
 

3381
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,720
 capability and I think those two last

3382
01:15:18,970 --> 01:15:20,720
 

3383
01:15:18,980 --> 01:15:23,360
 points are important if we want to build

3384
01:15:20,710 --> 01:15:23,360
 

3385
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:24,809
 models that we can trust and that we can

3386
01:15:23,350 --> 01:15:24,809
 

3387
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:27,959
 understand

3388
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:27,959
 

3389
01:15:24,809 --> 01:15:30,719
 when we apply machine learning and with

3390
01:15:27,949 --> 01:15:30,719
 

3391
01:15:27,959 --> 01:15:33,239
 that I would you know say that Leo and I

3392
01:15:30,709 --> 01:15:33,239
 

3393
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:36,719
 are really grateful and thankful to the

3394
01:15:33,229 --> 01:15:36,719
 

3395
01:15:33,239 --> 01:15:39,659
 committee for this impressive and you

3396
01:15:36,709 --> 01:15:39,659
 

3397
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:42,050
 know humbling recognition of our work so

3398
01:15:39,649 --> 01:15:42,050
 

3399
01:15:39,659 --> 01:15:42,050
 thank you

3400
01:15:48,799 --> 01:15:48,799
 

3401
01:15:48,809 --> 01:15:52,639
 so we have time for a few questions

3402
01:15:56,319 --> 01:15:56,319
 

3403
01:15:56,329 --> 01:15:59,329
 questions

3404
01:16:03,709 --> 01:16:03,709
 

3405
01:16:03,719 --> 01:16:07,970
 if no questions then I guess we'll get

3406
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,970
 

3407
01:16:05,850 --> 01:16:12,919
 to the break thank you again

3408
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:12,919
 

3409
01:16:07,970 --> 01:16:12,919
