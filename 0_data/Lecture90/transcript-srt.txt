00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,950
 it's loading

2
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:45,630
 

3
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,580
 I got up at 6:00 this morning

4
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,120
 

5
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:14,040
 all right so let's see okay it's 8:30

6
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:18,420
 

7
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:25,419
 good morning everyone it is 8:30 so we

8
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,419
 

9
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:27,789
 will get started welcome to the

10
00:04:25,409 --> 00:04:27,789
 

11
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:30,669
 conference we have a very exciting day

12
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:30,669
 

13
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:33,039
 of activities planned for you so a

14
00:04:30,659 --> 00:04:33,039
 

15
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:35,979
 couple of things about this tutorial

16
00:04:33,029 --> 00:04:35,979
 

17
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:38,139
 first of all there will be a break about

18
00:04:35,969 --> 00:04:38,139
 

19
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:38,680
 halfway through so just keep that in

20
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:38,680
 

21
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:40,780
 mind

22
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,780
 

23
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,060
 secondly if you could hold your

24
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,060
 

25
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,889
 questions until the end because we are

26
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,889
 

27
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:47,199
 such a large group that would be

28
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:47,199
 

29
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:49,180
 fantastic when we get to the point of

30
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:49,180
 

31
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,430
 questions there are two microphones one

32
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,430
 

33
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,949
 over there in that aisle and one over

34
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,949
 

35
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:56,470
 there in that aisle also there may be

36
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:56,470
 

37
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:58,270
 press in attendance so please keep that

38
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,270
 

39
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:01,810
 in mind when you're asking your

40
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,810
 

41
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:03,970
 questions great and with that I am

42
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,970
 

43
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:07,210
 delighted to introduce Fernanda Viegas

44
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,210
 

45
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:09,789
 and Martin Wattenberg I'm an enormous

46
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,789
 

47
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:12,160
 fan of their work so it's a true honor

48
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:12,160
 

49
00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:14,860
 to be introducing them here today and to

50
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,860
 

51
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,030
 have them here at the conference for

52
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,030
 

53
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,280
 those of you who don't know them

54
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,280
 

55
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:21,370
 Fernanda and Martin co-lead Google's

56
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:21,370
 

57
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:24,039
 pair people and AI research initiative

58
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,039
 

59
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:25,750
 as part of Google brain and their work

60
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:25,750
 

61
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:28,120
 in machine learning focuses on

62
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,120
 

63
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:31,210
 transparency and interpretability

64
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,210
 

65
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:34,720
 part of a broad agenda to improve human

66
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,720
 

67
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:36,340
 AI collaboration interaction they're

68
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,340
 

69
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,050
 extremely well known for their

70
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,050
 

71
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:40,570
 contributions to social and

72
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,570
 

73
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:43,060
 collaborative visualization and for the

74
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,060
 

75
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:45,490
 systems they've created which used daily

76
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,490
 

77
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:47,530
 by millions of people and as if that

78
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,530
 

79
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:49,930
 wasn't enough awesomeness their

80
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,930
 

81
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:52,330
 visualization based artwork has also

82
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,330
 

83
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:54,190
 been exhibited worldwide and is part of

84
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,190
 

85
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:56,979
 the permanent collection at the Museum

86
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,979
 

87
00:05:54,190 --> 00:06:00,330
 of Modern Art in New York and with that

88
00:05:56,969 --> 00:06:00,330
 

89
00:05:56,979 --> 00:06:00,330
 I will hand over to them

90
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:04,980
 

91
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:11,389
 Thank You Hana thank you it's such an

92
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:11,389
 

93
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:14,000
 honor to be here we were so excited that

94
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:14,000
 

95
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:17,000
 there would be a tutorial at nerves

96
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:17,000
 

97
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,729
 about data visualization so let's get

98
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:19,729
 

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,849
 started we have a lot of ground to cover

100
00:06:19,719 --> 00:06:22,849
 

101
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:26,919
 and we just wanted to briefly introduce

102
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:26,919
 

103
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:30,349
 our team today we're gonna talk some

104
00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:30,349
 

105
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:31,729
 about our work but not a whole lie there

106
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:31,729
 

107
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:34,129
 will be a lot of work that was done

108
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:34,129
 

109
00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:37,250
 outside of our team and we're hoping to

110
00:06:34,119 --> 00:06:37,250
 

111
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:40,159
 give a landscape but these are the

112
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,159
 

113
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:43,849
 awesome folks that we work with at

114
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:43,849
 

115
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:46,009
 Google Martin and I also co-lead as

116
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:46,009
 

117
00:06:43,849 --> 00:06:48,050
 Hannah said the pair initiative the

118
00:06:45,999 --> 00:06:48,050
 

119
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:50,810
 people plus AI research initiative at

120
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,810
 

121
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:52,969
 Google and this aims to bring design

122
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,969
 

123
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:56,330
 thinking and HCI human-computer

124
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:56,330
 

125
00:06:52,969 --> 00:06:57,979
 interaction to machine learning and

126
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,979
 

127
00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:00,169
 hopefully you will see a little bit of

128
00:06:57,969 --> 00:07:00,169
 

129
00:06:57,979 --> 00:07:03,740
 what we mean by that as we talk about

130
00:07:00,159 --> 00:07:03,740
 

131
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:06,379
 some of the work we've done so today's

132
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:06,379
 

133
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:09,069
 agenda we're trying to hit a couple of

134
00:07:06,369 --> 00:07:09,069
 

135
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:12,740
 things one is what is data visualization

136
00:07:09,059 --> 00:07:12,740
 

137
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:14,599
 how does it work what are some of the

138
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,599
 

139
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,099
 best practices so when you're when

140
00:07:14,589 --> 00:07:16,099
 

141
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:17,560
 you're thinking about creating data

142
00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:17,560
 

143
00:07:16,099 --> 00:07:20,240
 visualization and using data

144
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:20,240
 

145
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:23,810
 visualization in your own work what

146
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:23,810
 

147
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:27,139
 could you do to make it work better and

148
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,139
 

149
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:29,000
 then secondly how has visualization been

150
00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:29,000
 

151
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:30,770
 applied to machine learning we're gonna

152
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,770
 

153
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,479
 as I said do an overview of the

154
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,479
 

155
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:34,550
 landscape some of the things we're gonna

156
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:34,550
 

157
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,750
 touch on very briefly because we feel

158
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,750
 

159
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:38,479
 like some of these things are well

160
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,479
 

161
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:42,020
 understood by the community so we're not

162
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:42,020
 

163
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:43,430
 gonna dwell on basics and then we're

164
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:43,430
 

165
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:46,009
 also gonna talk about a very special

166
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,009
 

167
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:47,539
 case that I think is a very native to

168
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:47,539
 

169
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:50,270
 machine learning which is high

170
00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:50,270
 

171
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:53,839
 dimensional data massively high

172
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,839
 

173
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:55,759
 dimensional data and we're gonna end up

174
00:07:53,829 --> 00:07:55,759
 

175
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:59,810
 with some what we think are promising

176
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:59,810
 

177
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:02,569
 directions the goals of this tutorial

178
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,569
 

179
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:04,460
 the way we thought about them are for

180
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,460
 

181
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:06,770
 you to understand the state of the art

182
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,770
 

183
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:09,709
 so catch up on what some of the best

184
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,709
 

185
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:11,029
 practices are what people are doing with

186
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:11,029
 

187
00:08:09,709 --> 00:08:12,060
 little visualization in machine learning

188
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:12,060
 

189
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:14,850
 today

190
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,850
 

191
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:17,580
 and then secondly how do you apply this

192
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,580
 

193
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:19,680
 to your own work we're going to talk

194
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,680
 

195
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:22,530
 about some reference tools and libraries

196
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:22,530
 

197
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,990
 and give you references to literature so

198
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,990
 

199
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:27,060
 that you can also become a visualizer

200
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,060
 

201
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:30,570
 you can also create hopefully new

202
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:30,570
 

203
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:32,789
 techniques and better techniques alright

204
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,789
 

205
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:34,740
 so let's start diving in what what is

206
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,740
 

207
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:36,390
 data visualization I'm sure that if you

208
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,390
 

209
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:38,219
 work with machine learning you've come

210
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,219
 

211
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:40,440
 across data visualization you know what

212
00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:40,440
 

213
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:44,130
 it is basically you are transforming

214
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:44,130
 

215
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:46,410
 data into visual encodings right what is

216
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,410
 

217
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:48,510
 this good for it's good for a bunch of

218
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,510
 

219
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:51,450
 things independently of machine learning

220
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,450
 

221
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:53,880
 it's good for exploring when you don't

222
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,880
 

223
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:55,290
 have a question you know exactly but you

224
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,290
 

225
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,779
 just want to get a sense of the data

226
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,779
 

227
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:59,700
 it's obviously good for scientific

228
00:08:57,769 --> 00:08:59,700
 

229
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:03,690
 insight in fact this is a lot of its

230
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:03,690
 

231
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:05,940
 pedigree comes from science it's also

232
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,940
 

233
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:08,040
 good for communicating your results very

234
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:08,040
 

235
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:10,350
 good for communicating or results and

236
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:10,350
 

237
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:14,270
 also for education we're gonna touch on

238
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:14,270
 

239
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:17,280
 some of these use cases as we go along

240
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,280
 

241
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:18,900
 now one of the things that a lot of

242
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,900
 

243
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,660
 people who work with visualization or

244
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:21,660
 

245
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:23,790
 use visualization don't usually think

246
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,790
 

247
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:28,890
 about but we think it's really important

248
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:28,890
 

249
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:31,260
 is how do you ensure it works well how

250
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,260
 

251
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:33,990
 do you engage the visual system our

252
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,990
 

253
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:36,270
 visual system in really smart ways how

254
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,270
 

255
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:39,839
 do you work organically with with what

256
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,839
 

257
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:41,370
 our eyes do really well and so how do

258
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,370
 

259
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,260
 you take advantage of things like

260
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,260
 

261
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:45,270
 pre-attentive processing we're gonna

262
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,270
 

263
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,160
 talk very briefly about some of these

264
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,160
 

265
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:50,310
 things but this is like some of the most

266
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:50,310
 

267
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:54,060
 fascinating things behind visualizations

268
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:54,060
 

269
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:55,680
 that work well another question that we

270
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,680
 

271
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,510
 get sometimes is the state of

272
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,510
 

273
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,990
 visualization different from statistics

274
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,990
 

275
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:03,390
 and it's not that they are completely

276
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,390
 

277
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:06,180
 separate animals in fact I think they

278
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:06,180
 

279
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:08,430
 are really beautifully complementary but

280
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,430
 

281
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:11,390
 there are a few things that might be

282
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,390
 

283
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:14,250
 different so for instance when you were

284
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,250
 

285
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:16,500
 exploring with data visualization a lot

286
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,500
 

287
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:18,959
 of times you don't have a specific

288
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,959
 

289
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:21,330
 question in mind you just really want to

290
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:21,330
 

291
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,940
 get a sense of the lay of the land and

292
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,940
 

293
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:25,310
 what the shape of your data

294
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,310
 

295
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:26,900
 is and you don't even know what question

296
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,900
 

297
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:29,780
 you want to ask

298
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:29,780
 

299
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:33,080
 with classic statistics a lot of times

300
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:33,080
 

301
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:36,620
 you may have a specific question you're

302
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:36,620
 

303
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:38,720
 hoping to analyze and so that's one of

304
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,720
 

305
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:40,850
 the ways in which they could different

306
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,850
 

307
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,420
 even though we have a asterisk there

308
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,420
 

309
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:47,450
 saying okay in exploratory data analysis

310
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,450
 

311
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:50,060
 which is part of statistics you don't

312
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,060
 

313
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:52,430
 always have a question but then you're

314
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,430
 

315
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:54,800
 also probably using visualization anyway

316
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,800
 

317
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:58,030
 so you kind of back to visualization and

318
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:58,030
 

319
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:01,220
 as I said I really think that there is a

320
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:01,220
 

321
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:04,280
 complementarity between visualization

322
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:04,280
 

323
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:06,860
 and statistics so it could be that as a

324
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,860
 

325
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:09,080
 first pass you look at your data from a

326
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:09,080
 

327
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:11,750
 visualization perspective you get a

328
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,750
 

329
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:14,930
 sense of some interesting outliers or

330
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,930
 

331
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:17,600
 patterns and then you start engaging

332
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,600
 

333
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:19,430
 with statistical analysis to be like

334
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,430
 

335
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,490
 okay but is this is this generalized

336
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,490
 

337
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:27,800
 what's going on in the entire in my

338
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,800
 

339
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:29,480
 entire data set okay so let's talk a

340
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,480
 

341
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,490
 little bit about the history of

342
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,490
 

343
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,140
 visualization I think one of the things

344
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,140
 

345
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:35,390
 that's important to realize it's a very

346
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,390
 

347
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:38,060
 general technique and it actually goes

348
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,060
 

349
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:40,220
 back quite a long way and very briefly

350
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:40,220
 

351
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:42,470
 let's talk about this so one thing that

352
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:42,470
 

353
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:44,180
 I found fascinating when I first started

354
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,180
 

355
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:45,770
 to learn the history of the field is

356
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,770
 

357
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,930
 that many of the sort of standard

358
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,930
 

359
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:49,490
 business graphics line charts bar charts

360
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,490
 

361
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:51,980
 pie charts and so forth were all

362
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,980
 

363
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:54,770
 invented by the same person William

364
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:54,770
 

365
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:56,420
 Playfair who I think you know I think of

366
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,420
 

367
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:58,580
 him as an economist some of his most

368
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,580
 

369
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:00,980
 famous graphs are exactly like this one

370
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:00,980
 

371
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:03,380
 here where he's showing sort of in this

372
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,380
 

373
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:05,750
 case the balance of trade and showing

374
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,750
 

375
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:07,520
 both sort of the deficit and surplus in

376
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,520
 

377
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:09,980
 a very beautiful way by comparing two

378
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,980
 

379
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,630
 line graphs one of the funny things I

380
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,630
 

381
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,310
 discovered more recently as he was

382
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,310
 

383
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:15,320
 actually apparently a secret agent as

384
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,320
 

385
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:17,300
 part of this job so that just makes them

386
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:17,300
 

387
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,850
 all the more cool and something you know

388
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,850
 

389
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,230
 I think we can we can think of it a

390
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,230
 

391
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:24,770
 little bit more glamorous than the

392
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,770
 

393
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:26,870
 typical visualizer I another person who

394
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,870
 

395
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:29,810
 I think push the field forward was

396
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,810
 

397
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:32,750
 Florence Nightingale and the interesting

398
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,750
 

399
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:35,600
 thing here is that Florence Nightingale

400
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:35,600
 

401
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:36,499
 was was sort of known for her work on

402
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:36,499
 

403
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,779
 the

404
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,779
 

405
00:12:36,499 --> 00:12:42,049
 military battlefield looking at yo

406
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:42,049
 

407
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:43,909
 trying to see soldiers come in injured

408
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:43,909
 

409
00:12:42,049 --> 00:12:45,229
 try to make sure that they would not

410
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:45,229
 

411
00:12:43,909 --> 00:12:49,189
 stay injured that they would get better

412
00:12:45,219 --> 00:12:49,189
 

413
00:12:45,229 --> 00:12:52,009
 and one of the things that she noticed

414
00:12:49,179 --> 00:12:52,009
 

415
00:12:49,189 --> 00:12:54,349
 is that in fact people were largely not

416
00:12:51,999 --> 00:12:54,349
 

417
00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:56,809
 dying from wounds they had sustained

418
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:56,809
 

419
00:12:54,349 --> 00:12:58,099
 immediately on the battlefield but you

420
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:58,099
 

421
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:59,719
 know things would get infected they

422
00:12:58,089 --> 00:12:59,719
 

423
00:12:58,099 --> 00:13:02,239
 would get sick and they would die from

424
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:02,239
 

425
00:12:59,719 --> 00:13:04,009
 the sickness and she realized that with

426
00:13:02,229 --> 00:13:04,009
 

427
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:05,809
 the right kinds of sanitation and

428
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:05,809
 

429
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:08,629
 hygiene measures you could save millions

430
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:08,629
 

431
00:13:05,809 --> 00:13:11,029
 of lives now the interesting thing is

432
00:13:08,619 --> 00:13:11,029
 

433
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:12,649
 that when she tried to make this case it

434
00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:12,649
 

435
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:15,769
 actually didn't go over particularly

436
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,769
 

437
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:17,659
 well immediately and so she really had

438
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:17,659
 

439
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:19,549
 to pitch it to people in charge those

440
00:13:17,649 --> 00:13:19,549
 

441
00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:22,069
 top politicians and the way she did this

442
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:22,069
 

443
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:24,319
 was with visualizations so she created

444
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:24,319
 

445
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:25,369
 on a number of things what you here to

446
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:25,369
 

447
00:13:24,319 --> 00:13:27,259
 see here is something she called the

448
00:13:25,359 --> 00:13:27,259
 

449
00:13:25,369 --> 00:13:30,289
 cockscomb chart it's a kind of

450
00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:30,289
 

451
00:13:27,259 --> 00:13:31,819
 complicated hide schardt and it ended up

452
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:31,819
 

453
00:13:30,289 --> 00:13:33,859
 being very effective and helping her

454
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:33,859
 

455
00:13:31,819 --> 00:13:36,409
 make the case and arguably this is the

456
00:13:33,849 --> 00:13:36,409
 

457
00:13:33,859 --> 00:13:38,599
 most of the best visualization ever if

458
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,599
 

459
00:13:36,409 --> 00:13:41,539
 measured in terms of number of lives

460
00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:41,539
 

461
00:13:38,599 --> 00:13:43,759
 saved there's another important lesson

462
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,759
 

463
00:13:41,539 --> 00:13:46,279
 for visualizers as we look at this which

464
00:13:43,749 --> 00:13:46,279
 

465
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:48,679
 is that today I think a lot of people

466
00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:48,679
 

467
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:51,079
 who are very kind of uptight about

468
00:13:48,669 --> 00:13:51,079
 

469
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:52,549
 proper graphic design would look at this

470
00:13:51,069 --> 00:13:52,549
 

471
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:54,529
 and say it is not a good visualization

472
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:54,529
 

473
00:13:52,549 --> 00:13:55,970
 we'll talk later about different visual

474
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:55,970
 

475
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:58,369
 encodings and you can make an argument

476
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,369
 

477
00:13:55,970 --> 00:14:00,379
 that you know she's not really using the

478
00:13:58,359 --> 00:14:00,379
 

479
00:13:58,369 --> 00:14:02,269
 optimal things here that didn't matter

480
00:14:00,369 --> 00:14:02,269
 

481
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:03,619
 this visualization saved millions of

482
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:03,619
 

483
00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:05,899
 lives and I think it's an important

484
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:05,899
 

485
00:14:03,619 --> 00:14:08,809
 lesson that you know as we go into

486
00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:08,809
 

487
00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:10,579
 visualization as you try things out it's

488
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:10,579
 

489
00:14:08,809 --> 00:14:12,349
 much more important to focus on asking

490
00:14:10,569 --> 00:14:12,349
 

491
00:14:10,579 --> 00:14:15,529
 the right questions on getting the right

492
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:15,529
 

493
00:14:12,349 --> 00:14:18,139
 data rather than feeling incredibly

494
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,139
 

495
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:20,179
 nervous about you know exactly the right

496
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:20,179
 

497
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:23,479
 technique it's much better to do it and

498
00:14:20,169 --> 00:14:23,479
 

499
00:14:20,179 --> 00:14:27,039
 to focus on the data one final example

500
00:14:23,469 --> 00:14:27,039
 

501
00:14:23,479 --> 00:14:29,779
 of historical interest is w eb de bois

502
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:29,779
 

503
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:32,329
 created this fantastic album of

504
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:32,329
 

505
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:34,219
 visualizations with his students showing

506
00:14:32,319 --> 00:14:34,219
 

507
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:36,229
 a wide variety of demographic data and

508
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:36,229
 

509
00:14:34,219 --> 00:14:37,519
 these I think are some of the earliest

510
00:14:36,219 --> 00:14:37,519
 

511
00:14:36,229 --> 00:14:39,679
 visualizations that I've seen that

512
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:39,679
 

513
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,169
 you've sort of funny almost function

514
00:14:39,669 --> 00:14:42,169
 

515
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:45,059
 like a modern dashboard in the sense

516
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:45,059
 

517
00:14:42,169 --> 00:14:46,859
 that they combine many many different

518
00:14:45,049 --> 00:14:46,859
 

519
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:50,099
 sort of types of data about the same

520
00:14:46,849 --> 00:14:50,099
 

521
00:14:46,859 --> 00:14:51,269
 theme in one image and I think there's

522
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:51,269
 

523
00:14:50,099 --> 00:14:54,959
 actually a lot that we can learn from

524
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:54,959
 

525
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:56,699
 this in terms of both sort of the

526
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:56,699
 

527
00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:00,679
 purpose of visualization and again its

528
00:14:56,689 --> 00:15:00,679
 

529
00:14:56,699 --> 00:15:02,819
 efficacy in making a case but also in

530
00:15:00,669 --> 00:15:02,819
 

531
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:04,589
 combining data in various ways like this

532
00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:04,589
 

533
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:07,109
 is a very beautiful visualization that

534
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:07,109
 

535
00:15:04,589 --> 00:15:09,269
 has very natural legends it's like the

536
00:15:07,099 --> 00:15:09,269
 

537
00:15:07,109 --> 00:15:11,609
 legends are almost serving as a table

538
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:11,609
 

539
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:14,159
 you see it's really nicely labeled and

540
00:15:11,599 --> 00:15:14,159
 

541
00:15:11,609 --> 00:15:15,659
 it's it's actually a perfect example of

542
00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:15,659
 

543
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:20,069
 how to combine many different

544
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:20,069
 

545
00:15:15,659 --> 00:15:22,019
 visualizations in one place okay so what

546
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:22,019
 

547
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:23,699
 is it that make these work besides

548
00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:23,699
 

549
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:25,229
 having the right data and sort of asking

550
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,229
 

551
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:27,839
 the right questions well they're using

552
00:15:25,219 --> 00:15:27,839
 

553
00:15:25,229 --> 00:15:29,339
 our own visual system in ways that it

554
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:29,339
 

555
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,589
 maybe was not designed for you know

556
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:31,589
 

557
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:32,999
 we're supposed to have visions so that

558
00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:32,999
 

559
00:15:31,589 --> 00:15:34,739
 we can you know see an animal that's

560
00:15:32,989 --> 00:15:34,739
 

561
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:37,409
 about to eat us and run away from it or

562
00:15:34,729 --> 00:15:37,409
 

563
00:15:34,739 --> 00:15:40,319
 whatever on not you know we did not

564
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:40,319
 

565
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:43,229
 evolve to analyze data but the truth is

566
00:15:40,309 --> 00:15:43,229
 

567
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:45,209
 that the visual system you know is very

568
00:15:43,219 --> 00:15:45,209
 

569
00:15:43,229 --> 00:15:47,969
 special and I like to think of it like a

570
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,969
 

571
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:50,789
 GPU it has all of these native abilities

572
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:50,789
 

573
00:15:47,969 --> 00:15:53,639
 that worked incredibly fast better than

574
00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:53,639
 

575
00:15:50,789 --> 00:15:56,279
 our general-purpose brain but they're

576
00:15:53,629 --> 00:15:56,279
 

577
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:58,739
 very specialized as well and so the

578
00:15:56,269 --> 00:15:58,739
 

579
00:15:56,279 --> 00:16:01,019
 whole game behind visualization is much

580
00:15:58,729 --> 00:16:01,019
 

581
00:15:58,739 --> 00:16:02,669
 like GPU programming where you're taking

582
00:16:01,009 --> 00:16:02,669
 

583
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:05,219
 something that was made for videogames

584
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:05,219
 

585
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:05,929
 originally and you're repurposing it for

586
00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:05,929
 

587
00:16:05,219 --> 00:16:08,579
 something else

588
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:08,579
 

589
00:16:05,929 --> 00:16:11,159
 one consequence of this that I think is

590
00:16:08,569 --> 00:16:11,159
 

591
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:13,739
 actually critical to realize is that all

592
00:16:11,149 --> 00:16:13,739
 

593
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:16,439
 visualizations as a result involve

594
00:16:13,729 --> 00:16:16,439
 

595
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:18,839
 compromises you know it's not like we

596
00:16:16,429 --> 00:16:18,839
 

597
00:16:16,439 --> 00:16:20,729
 have this amazing data analysis part of

598
00:16:18,829 --> 00:16:20,729
 

599
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:22,289
 our brain but we're repurposing

600
00:16:20,719 --> 00:16:22,289
 

601
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:25,289
 something that was not built for that

602
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:25,289
 

603
00:16:22,289 --> 00:16:27,089
 and again that causes a lot of

604
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,089
 

605
00:16:25,289 --> 00:16:28,949
 trade-offs so let's talk about what

606
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:28,949
 

607
00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:31,889
 those sort of primitive operations are

608
00:16:28,939 --> 00:16:31,889
 

609
00:16:28,949 --> 00:16:34,619
 in the GPU in our brain how do these

610
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:34,619
 

611
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:36,119
 things work so the idea is that you want

612
00:16:34,609 --> 00:16:36,119
 

613
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:38,159
 to find visual encodings you want to

614
00:16:36,109 --> 00:16:38,159
 

615
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:40,409
 take data transform it into vision and

616
00:16:38,149 --> 00:16:40,409
 

617
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:42,299
 those encoding will do a bunch of things

618
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,299
 

619
00:16:40,409 --> 00:16:44,909
 so the first thing is they guide the

620
00:16:42,289 --> 00:16:44,909
 

621
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:46,889
 viewers attention the second is they

622
00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:46,889
 

623
00:16:44,909 --> 00:16:48,599
 communicate data now it's interesting

624
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:48,599
 

625
00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:50,639
 very often when you hear people talk

626
00:16:48,589 --> 00:16:50,639
 

627
00:16:48,599 --> 00:16:52,379
 about charting they'll think just about

628
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:52,379
 

629
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,819
 this middle thing they act like is just

630
00:16:52,369 --> 00:16:53,819
 

631
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:55,259
 about communicating data but this is

632
00:16:53,809 --> 00:16:55,259
 

633
00:16:53,819 --> 00:16:55,590
 just one of several things that's good

634
00:16:55,249 --> 00:16:55,590
 

635
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:57,960
 for

636
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,960
 

637
00:16:55,590 --> 00:17:00,240
 the third means thing you can do in a

638
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,240
 

639
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:02,220
 static operation is that you can let the

640
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,220
 

641
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,110
 viewer calculate with data and also some

642
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:04,110
 

643
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,939
 examples with that it turns out your

644
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,939
 

645
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:07,500
 brain can do some amazing calculations

646
00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:07,500
 

647
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:09,630
 very quickly and then once you're on a

648
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,630
 

649
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:12,510
 computer you can interactively explore

650
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:12,510
 

651
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:15,930
 data and that open there's a whole set

652
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,930
 

653
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:18,000
 of frontiers beyond paper okay so let's

654
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,000
 

655
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:20,730
 take a look at some examples on let's

656
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,730
 

657
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,250
 talk about the example of you have wind

658
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,250
 

659
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:25,199
 data and you want to show wind data

660
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,199
 

661
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,459
 across the world this is something

662
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:26,459
 

663
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,910
 people have thought about for hundreds

664
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:26,910
 

665
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:29,190
 of years

666
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,190
 

667
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:31,020
 I think the earliest example that I

668
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,020
 

669
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:33,780
 could find comes from Edmund Halley

670
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:33,780
 

671
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:36,750
 in the 1600s and it's this map of trade

672
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:36,750
 

673
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:38,130
 winds in the ocean and you can see what

674
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,130
 

675
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:40,710
 he's doing is he's basically doing

676
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,710
 

677
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:42,180
 something fairly reasonable he's saying

678
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,180
 

679
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:43,980
 I'm going to show the direction of wind

680
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,980
 

681
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:46,500
 with you know a vector that points in

682
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:46,500
 

683
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:48,450
 the right direction it's static but it

684
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:48,450
 

685
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,830
 actually works pretty well let's talk

686
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,830
 

687
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:56,340
 about how you might use this on in

688
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:56,340
 

689
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:58,380
 modern setting okay so this is a

690
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:58,380
 

691
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:02,580
 visualization that Fernanda and I

692
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:02,580
 

693
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:04,740
 created as an art project many years ago

694
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,740
 

695
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:08,190
 this is showing the wind across the

696
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:08,190
 

697
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:09,450
 United States right now and you can see

698
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,450
 

699
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:12,870
 that the encoding we're using is very

700
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,870
 

701
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:14,880
 much like Edmund Haley's however what

702
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,880
 

703
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:16,679
 we're doing is adding motion as well in

704
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,679
 

705
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,929
 fact if you look at this legend down

706
00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:18,929
 

707
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:20,310
 here you'll see that you know the legend

708
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:20,310
 

709
00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:23,370
 is actually not a static thing it's

710
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,370
 

711
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:26,940
 moving like the whole whole thing this

712
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,940
 

713
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:29,940
 is a very very simple visualization it

714
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:29,940
 

715
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:31,770
 is designed really for us we created

716
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,770
 

717
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:34,230
 this as an art project not a science

718
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,230
 

719
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:37,280
 project even though it turns out later

720
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:37,280
 

721
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:39,210
 scientists became interested in this and

722
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:39,210
 

723
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,840
 you can see that there's a sort of

724
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,840
 

725
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:45,679
 simplicity to it that's very nice okay

726
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,679
 

727
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,679
 what about

728
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:48,950
 

729
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:56,460
 okay so let's look at a more complicated

730
00:18:51,909 --> 00:18:56,460
 

731
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:59,029
 encoding that was done later about the

732
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:59,029
 

733
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:02,070
 year after we created that visualization

734
00:18:59,019 --> 00:19:02,070
 

735
00:18:59,029 --> 00:19:05,190
 someone in Cameron Vicario was inspired

736
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:05,190
 

737
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:06,840
 and he created this globe visualization

738
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,840
 

739
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:08,159
 and you can see he's a lot more

740
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,159
 

741
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,350
 encodings and I think it's very

742
00:19:08,149 --> 00:19:10,350
 

743
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:13,230
 interesting to sort of sift through this

744
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:13,230
 

745
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:16,320
 and take a look at all the things he's

746
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,320
 

747
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:18,720
 doing so lifehouse he is using sort of

748
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,720
 

749
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,510
 motion and angle so you know we built

750
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:21,510
 

751
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,820
 onto Edmund Halley he's building up

752
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,820
 

753
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:27,419
 we've he's adding in a color here which

754
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:27,419
 

755
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:29,610
 I think in this case indicates the sort

756
00:19:27,409 --> 00:19:29,610
 

757
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:31,620
 of scale of this but we can actually add

758
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,620
 

759
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:36,120
 all sorts of other things so we can say

760
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:36,120
 

761
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:37,980
 let's look at particulate matter and now

762
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,980
 

763
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:40,830
 it's going to show us all sorts of you

764
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:40,830
 

765
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:42,630
 know dust and smoke again using a color

766
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,630
 

767
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:44,070
 scale you might ask how did he choose

768
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,070
 

769
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:45,149
 those colors we'll talk a little bit

770
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,149
 

771
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:47,279
 about that in a moment

772
00:19:45,139 --> 00:19:47,279
 

773
00:19:45,149 --> 00:19:51,899
 you could overlay all sorts of other

774
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:51,899
 

775
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:55,020
 things you could change projections in

776
00:19:51,889 --> 00:19:55,020
 

777
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:59,250
 various ways all sorts of crazy

778
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:59,250
 

779
00:19:55,020 --> 00:20:01,980
 projections in fact and let's see I

780
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,980
 

781
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:08,760
 think we can even get waves if we look

782
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:08,760
 

783
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:10,049
 in the right place let's see we've in

784
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,049
 

785
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,669
 the interest of time I won't show all

786
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:11,669
 

787
00:20:10,049 --> 00:20:13,440
 the things I can do but you can see that

788
00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:13,440
 

789
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:15,720
 essentially by layering of various

790
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,720
 

791
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:20,309
 encoding he's able to actually show more

792
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:20,309
 

793
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:23,429
 data on this okay so let's talk about

794
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:23,429
 

795
00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:25,200
 those encoding specifically so there are

796
00:20:23,419 --> 00:20:25,200
 

797
00:20:23,429 --> 00:20:28,110
 many different types of ways that you

798
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,110
 

799
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,610
 can put numbers into images you see some

800
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,610
 

801
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:31,500
 of them laid out here there's certainly

802
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,500
 

803
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:33,090
 many more and the whole game behind

804
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:33,090
 

805
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,690
 visualization is that each of these are

806
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,690
 

807
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:39,029
 good for various things so for example

808
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,029
 

809
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:41,880
 position and length are very good for

810
00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:41,880
 

811
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:44,370
 communicating exact values as is text

812
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:44,370
 

813
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,870
 for instance certainly you can get

814
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,870
 

815
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:49,799
 things you know to that and the decimal

816
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:49,799
 

817
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:53,070
 point that way what about ratios their

818
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:53,070
 

819
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:55,799
 length is really good whereas you know

820
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,799
 

821
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:59,159
 position areas somewhat okay color is

822
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:59,159
 

823
00:20:55,799 --> 00:21:00,600
 just impossible to tell ratios and this

824
00:20:59,149 --> 00:21:00,600
 

825
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:01,720
 is sort of as it you know it's this

826
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,720
 

827
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,519
 perceptual fat

828
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,519
 

829
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,740
 so that your brain is kind of computing

830
00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:05,740
 

831
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:07,299
 ratios this is sort of what will help

832
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,299
 

833
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:10,659
 you decide between for example a bar

834
00:21:07,289 --> 00:21:10,659
 

835
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:12,909
 chart and a line chart other things are

836
00:21:10,649 --> 00:21:12,909
 

837
00:21:10,659 --> 00:21:15,039
 good for drawing attention color is one

838
00:21:12,899 --> 00:21:15,039
 

839
00:21:12,909 --> 00:21:16,600
 of the first things we see when we go

840
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:16,600
 

841
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:19,029
 look at a visualization and it tells us

842
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:19,029
 

843
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,830
 where we should be looking for for next

844
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:20,830
 

845
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:22,840
 area is also a very good way to draw

846
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,840
 

847
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:24,879
 attention bigger things much more

848
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,879
 

849
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:28,450
 prominent and draw your attention with

850
00:21:24,869 --> 00:21:28,450
 

851
00:21:24,879 --> 00:21:30,129
 smaller things color I want to talk a

852
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,129
 

853
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:31,480
 little bit about just because this is

854
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:31,480
 

855
00:21:30,129 --> 00:21:33,639
 something that in some ways is one of

856
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,639
 

857
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,799
 the best understood phenomena are

858
00:21:33,629 --> 00:21:35,799
 

859
00:21:33,639 --> 00:21:38,940
 encodings and it's actually very subtle

860
00:21:35,789 --> 00:21:38,940
 

861
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:41,049
 so starting a couple decades ago

862
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,049
 

863
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:42,460
 rogowitz and train --is-- where some of

864
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,460
 

865
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:45,250
 the people who really started doing this

866
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:45,250
 

867
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:47,470
 people started asking what is the right

868
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,470
 

869
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:49,960
 way if you are showing the America data

870
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,960
 

871
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:52,059
 with color that you should show it now

872
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:52,059
 

873
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,190
 an interesting question is why are you

874
00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:54,190
 

875
00:21:52,059 --> 00:21:55,779
 showing numeric data using color because

876
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,779
 

877
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:58,419
 we just talked about how things like

878
00:21:55,769 --> 00:21:58,419
 

879
00:21:55,779 --> 00:22:00,970
 position length and so far it's there's

880
00:21:58,409 --> 00:22:00,970
 

881
00:21:58,419 --> 00:22:03,129
 so much better for communicating numbers

882
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,129
 

883
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:04,840
 on the other hand if you remember back

884
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:04,840
 

885
00:22:03,129 --> 00:22:06,820
 to that wind map that I show the final

886
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,820
 

887
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,139
 one on the globe the point there is that

888
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:08,139
 

889
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:10,419
 if you wanted to show something like

890
00:22:08,129 --> 00:22:10,419
 

891
00:22:08,139 --> 00:22:12,129
 temperature pressure or so forth you

892
00:22:10,409 --> 00:22:12,129
 

893
00:22:10,419 --> 00:22:13,870
 would already used up all your spatial

894
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:13,870
 

895
00:22:12,129 --> 00:22:16,179
 dimensions so color was essentially one

896
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,179
 

897
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:18,000
 of the few things you have left and for

898
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:18,000
 

899
00:22:16,179 --> 00:22:20,620
 this reason color is very important on

900
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:20,620
 

901
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,759
 they so rogowitz entrain ish did a

902
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:24,759
 

903
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:26,799
 series of careful studies where they

904
00:22:24,749 --> 00:22:26,799
 

905
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:29,470
 would take the same data in this case I

906
00:22:26,789 --> 00:22:29,470
 

907
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:31,240
 think it's an MRI scan they would I sort

908
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,240
 

909
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:33,070
 of display it using all sorts of

910
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:33,070
 

911
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,659
 different color scales and they came to

912
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,659
 

913
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:37,230
 sort of some interesting conclusions so

914
00:22:34,649 --> 00:22:37,230
 

915
00:22:34,659 --> 00:22:39,940
 one is that they found that for

916
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,940
 

917
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:43,269
 high-frequency components luminance is

918
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:43,269
 

919
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:46,149
 the best thing to sort of much easier to

920
00:22:43,259 --> 00:22:46,149
 

921
00:22:43,269 --> 00:22:48,970
 see and you can essentially you know

922
00:22:46,139 --> 00:22:48,970
 

923
00:22:46,149 --> 00:22:50,379
 make sense of numbers best that way hue

924
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,379
 

925
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:52,450
 is actually somewhat better for

926
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,450
 

927
00:22:50,379 --> 00:22:53,710
 low-frequency components one thing that

928
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,710
 

929
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:55,990
 they did discover though even though

930
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,990
 

931
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:58,240
 there's no best scale is it in many ways

932
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,240
 

933
00:22:55,990 --> 00:23:00,129
 a rainbow scale one of the most popular

934
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,129
 

935
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,080
 things is actually really bad that it

936
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:02,080
 

937
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:03,759
 has all sorts of weird optical illusions

938
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,759
 

939
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:07,360
 that occur in it and then the less

940
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:07,360
 

941
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:10,240
 decades later people still use it

942
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:10,240
 

943
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:12,670
 practically speaking so how do you make

944
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:12,670
 

945
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,190
 sense of all of these different types of

946
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:15,190
 

947
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:16,660
 colors so there's a lot of theory and

948
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,660
 

949
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:19,420
 one of the things that I would say is

950
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:19,420
 

951
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:21,100
 that a great way to use these things of

952
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:21,100
 

953
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,550
 practice is to go to a site called color

954
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:21,550
 

955
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,460
 Brewer

956
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:24,460
 

957
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:24,940
 and this was created by symphony cynthia

958
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:24,940
 

959
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:28,750
 brewer

960
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:28,750
 

961
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:31,450
 she's a cartographer its color Brewer 2

962
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,450
 

963
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:34,000
 org and it's actually a very beautiful

964
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,000
 

965
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:35,950
 site on a number of levels so one thing

966
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,950
 

967
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,410
 that's cool is it will let you try out

968
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,410
 

969
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:41,020
 different palettes on in sort of

970
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,020
 

971
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:43,900
 realistic settings so what we're showing

972
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:43,900
 

973
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:46,300
 here is he has kind of a sample set of

974
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:46,300
 

975
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:51,370
 data at what looks like maybe city level

976
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:51,370
 

977
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:53,710
 or county level on map and then you can

978
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,710
 

979
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:56,680
 try out different scales and see what

980
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,680
 

981
00:23:53,710 --> 00:24:01,300
 they look like these are sort of multi

982
00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:01,300
 

983
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:02,890
 hue you can try single hue you can these

984
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:02,890
 

985
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,240
 are all sequential scales in which

986
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,240
 

987
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:06,460
 you've got some number that's

988
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:06,460
 

989
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,340
 monotonically sort of increasing that's

990
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:09,340
 

991
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:11,530
 that's all that you care about you could

992
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:11,530
 

993
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:14,800
 also try different diverging scales so

994
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,800
 

995
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:16,660
 if sometimes there's a special unit for

996
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,660
 

997
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,220
 example in many cases positive numbers

998
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,220
 

999
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:20,380
 and negative numbers means very very

1000
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:20,380
 

1001
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:21,970
 different things and in those cases you

1002
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:21,970
 

1003
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:23,710
 might want a diverging scale in which

1004
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,710
 

1005
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:26,890
 two ends of the scale look very

1006
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,890
 

1007
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:28,270
 different you can also try different

1008
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,270
 

1009
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:30,610
 qualitative scales where maybe you don't

1010
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,610
 

1011
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:32,440
 want to have any sense of a sequence and

1012
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,440
 

1013
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:35,080
 in that case you want a set of colors

1014
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:35,080
 

1015
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:38,710
 that doesn't convey any sort of sequence

1016
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:38,710
 

1017
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:40,570
 in the same way that these ones do so as

1018
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,570
 

1019
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:42,430
 of both a practical tool and a way to

1020
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,430
 

1021
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:44,050
 learn about these colors strong

1022
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,050
 

1023
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:47,380
 recommendation for the color brewery

1024
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,380
 

1025
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:49,600
 site so just one more thing I think is

1026
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:49,600
 

1027
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:52,090
 really important here when you're

1028
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:52,090
 

1029
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:55,840
 talking about categorical data or these

1030
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,840
 

1031
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:58,240
 diverging palettes one of the tricks is

1032
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:58,240
 

1033
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,250
 to make sure that your cut you choose a

1034
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,250
 

1035
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,890
 color palette where one color doesn't

1036
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,890
 

1037
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:05,500
 look more important than the other right

1038
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,500
 

1039
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:07,600
 one color should not pop up and the

1040
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:07,600
 

1041
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,850
 others receive because that can be

1042
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,850
 

1043
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,620
 perceived as one category being more

1044
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,620
 

1045
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:12,500
 important than the other so that's why

1046
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:12,500
 

1047
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:15,500
 having

1048
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:15,500
 

1049
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:18,080
 tools like color blue Brewer is really

1050
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:18,080
 

1051
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:20,510
 helpful because the the palette has been

1052
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:20,510
 

1053
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,040
 balanced from a perceptual perspective

1054
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,040
 

1055
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:26,200
 to make sure that everything kind of

1056
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:26,200
 

1057
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:26,200
 looks like it has the same importance

1058
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:34,240
 

1059
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:39,799
 okay okay and the thing that would

1060
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,799
 

1061
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,590
 emphasize is that this is a genuinely

1062
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:42,590
 

1063
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:44,590
 subtle art picking the right color and

1064
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,590
 

1065
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:46,520
 in fact there's been you know very

1066
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,520
 

1067
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:48,980
 active research and the visualization

1068
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,980
 

1069
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,330
 community to this day one thing I would

1070
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:50,330
 

1071
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,679
 just sort of point out as an interesting

1072
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,679
 

1073
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:54,760
 paper if you do want to read more about

1074
00:25:51,669 --> 00:25:54,760
 

1075
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:58,010
 this is this recent paper from CAI and

1076
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:58,010
 

1077
00:25:54,760 --> 00:26:00,080
 they tested a whole bunch of color

1078
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,080
 

1079
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:01,820
 scales that had been put together by

1080
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,820
 

1081
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,640
 people who had you know knew something

1082
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,640
 

1083
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:07,159
 about perception plus the rainbow color

1084
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:07,159
 

1085
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,990
 scale just to kind of bash it and they

1086
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:08,990
 

1087
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:11,150
 did a wide variety of sort of human

1088
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,150
 

1089
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:13,100
 subject studies and it essentially

1090
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,100
 

1091
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:15,740
 confirmed the rainbow color scale is not

1092
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:15,740
 

1093
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:17,510
 very good other ones are better but it's

1094
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:17,510
 

1095
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,100
 a subtle art and it's hard to find

1096
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,100
 

1097
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:21,590
 significant differences between the top

1098
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:21,590
 

1099
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:23,570
 ones one thing that's critical though is

1100
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,570
 

1101
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:26,240
 all of these color scales kind of

1102
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,240
 

1103
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:28,250
 collapse in a crazy way if you're

1104
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:28,250
 

1105
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,179
 colorblind and it's important to

1106
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,179
 

1107
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,710
 remember the actually a fairly

1108
00:26:29,169 --> 00:26:30,710
 

1109
00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:33,350
 significant number of people have

1110
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,350
 

1111
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:36,679
 trouble in some aspect of colorblindness

1112
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:36,679
 

1113
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:39,679
 most typically sort of red-green color

1114
00:26:36,669 --> 00:26:39,679
 

1115
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:41,210
 blindness is a super common something

1116
00:26:39,669 --> 00:26:41,210
 

1117
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:44,720
 like eight to ten percent of men have

1118
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,720
 

1119
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:45,409
 that and if you have that kind of

1120
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:45,409
 

1121
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,870
 colorblindness

1122
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:47,870
 

1123
00:26:45,409 --> 00:26:50,419
 this is exactly what all of these

1124
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:50,419
 

1125
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:52,909
 beautiful color scales look like to you

1126
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:52,909
 

1127
00:26:50,419 --> 00:26:54,770
 and so it's important if you are making

1128
00:26:52,899 --> 00:26:54,770
 

1129
00:26:52,909 --> 00:26:56,690
 a general tool something that's not just

1130
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,690
 

1131
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:59,600
 for you to look at but something that's

1132
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,600
 

1133
00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:01,130
 very general to think hard about what is

1134
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,130
 

1135
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,159
 a safe thing to do so for instance

1136
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,159
 

1137
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:05,840
 there's the blue orange scale down here

1138
00:27:04,149 --> 00:27:05,840
 

1139
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,730
 and you can see that actually survives

1140
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,730
 

1141
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,400
 pretty well for a colorblind person

1142
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,400
 

1143
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:11,990
 whereas some of these other things you

1144
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,990
 

1145
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,490
 know certainly like the rainbow map

1146
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,490
 

1147
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:19,580
 doesn't look good at all and some of the

1148
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:19,580
 

1149
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:21,940
 other things are very hard okay all

1150
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:21,940
 

1151
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:23,920
 right so now

1152
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,920
 

1153
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:26,170
 let's talk a little bit about one of my

1154
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:26,170
 

1155
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:29,050
 favorite things one of my favorite

1156
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,050
 

1157
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:30,250
 superpowers in data visualization it's

1158
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,250
 

1159
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:32,560
 what we call pre-attentive processing

1160
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,560
 

1161
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:34,060
 and it goes back to a little bit to what

1162
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,060
 

1163
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:36,370
 Martin was saying about our mind

1164
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:36,370
 

1165
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:41,470
 function our visual system functioning

1166
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:41,470
 

1167
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:43,570
 like a GPU it turns out that we're

1168
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,570
 

1169
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:45,100
 really good if we're giving the right

1170
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,100
 

1171
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:48,400
 stimuli I'm gonna go back a little bit

1172
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:48,400
 

1173
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:52,200
 if we're giving the right kind of visual

1174
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:52,200
 

1175
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:55,840
 stimuli our our visual system just

1176
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:55,840
 

1177
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:59,440
 worked super fast incredibly fast faster

1178
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:59,440
 

1179
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:01,540
 than you moving your eyes okay so to

1180
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:01,540
 

1181
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,520
 give you an example of this let's look

1182
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:03,520
 

1183
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:10,150
 at these numbers and let's count the

1184
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:10,150
 

1185
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:13,750
 fives number five and now let's count

1186
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:13,750
 

1187
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:17,680
 the fives again okay so this is how fast

1188
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:17,680
 

1189
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:20,560
 it is as long as we encode the stimuli

1190
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:20,560
 

1191
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:23,560
 in a way that takes advantage of this

1192
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:23,560
 

1193
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:26,740
 pre-processing power we have it just

1194
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:26,740
 

1195
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:29,050
 works you don't even have to try so how

1196
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:29,050
 

1197
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:31,390
 do we do this it turns out that there is

1198
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,390
 

1199
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:34,090
 theory behind this that there are

1200
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,090
 

1201
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:38,710
 certain things we are acutely aware of

1202
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:38,710
 

1203
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:40,180
 visually one of them is is color just

1204
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,180
 

1205
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:42,550
 like what you just saw with the number

1206
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:42,550
 

1207
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:44,440
 Five's but there are other things too

1208
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,440
 

1209
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:48,040
 there are difference in differences in

1210
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:48,040
 

1211
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:50,250
 shapes differences in alignment there's

1212
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:50,250
 

1213
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:54,070
 a bunch of different things you can use

1214
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,070
 

1215
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:57,460
 that will just work incredibly fast for

1216
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:57,460
 

1217
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:59,110
 your reviewers here's just insert

1218
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:59,110
 

1219
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:01,390
 something as we talked about this which

1220
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,390
 

1221
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:04,120
 is that it doesn't mean that all of

1222
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:04,120
 

1223
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:05,770
 these are equally good so one thing that

1224
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,770
 

1225
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,960
 is pre-attentive for example is

1226
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,960
 

1227
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:10,840
 sharpness versus blurriness and in fact

1228
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:10,840
 

1229
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:13,000
 that has been explored as something that

1230
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:13,000
 

1231
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:15,220
 is a way of encoding data I would say if

1232
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:15,220
 

1233
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,200
 you absolutely have to you could

1234
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:17,200
 

1235
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,300
 consider that but if not be careful

1236
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,300
 

1237
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,230
 because it turns out to be incredibly

1238
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,230
 

1239
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:22,300
 fatiguing to look at all the blurry

1240
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,300
 

1241
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:24,190
 stuff on the screen if you do that so

1242
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:24,190
 

1243
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:26,610
 this is an example of the type of

1244
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,610
 

1245
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:29,800
 trade-off that you see in visual agents

1246
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,800
 

1247
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:32,050
 absolutely and so and and one of the

1248
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:32,050
 

1249
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:35,530
 things that you get for free with these

1250
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:35,530
 

1251
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:38,350
 kinds of visual encodings is that in a

1252
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,350
 

1253
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:40,720
 sense no matter how many distractors you

1254
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,720
 

1255
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:43,360
 have certain things are going to pop up

1256
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:43,360
 

1257
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:46,270
 really really fast so things like color

1258
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:46,270
 

1259
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:50,020
 again as long as you choose the right

1260
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:50,020
 

1261
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:53,050
 color palette is going to pop up really

1262
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:53,050
 

1263
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:54,790
 really well for people shape also tends

1264
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,790
 

1265
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:58,720
 to be one of those things but again even

1266
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:58,720
 

1267
00:29:54,790 --> 00:30:01,720
 here for me as I look at the example one

1268
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:01,720
 

1269
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:04,180
 color versus the example in shape color

1270
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:04,180
 

1271
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:06,820
 for me where it's way faster way better

1272
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:06,820
 

1273
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:09,400
 than shape so again these trade-offs

1274
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:09,400
 

1275
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:11,620
 that Martin is talking about are really

1276
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,620
 

1277
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:13,570
 important and chances are that your

1278
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,570
 

1279
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:16,750
 visualization is never gonna be as

1280
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,750
 

1281
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:20,170
 simple as this right it's probably going

1282
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:20,170
 

1283
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:22,410
 to have multiple dimensions and so again

1284
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,410
 

1285
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:26,020
 things are always a trade-off between

1286
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:26,020
 

1287
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:29,470
 these visual stimuli your visual

1288
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:29,470
 

1289
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:32,290
 encodings right but also everything on

1290
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,290
 

1291
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:34,360
 the page everything that you're showing

1292
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,360
 

1293
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:37,420
 at once and so this is something that

1294
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:37,420
 

1295
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:40,060
 you have to constantly keep in mind just

1296
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:40,060
 

1297
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:41,950
 very very simple thing to do when you're

1298
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:41,950
 

1299
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:43,540
 if you are creating a visualization and

1300
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,540
 

1301
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:46,420
 you aren't sure how well things are

1302
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:46,420
 

1303
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:48,070
 working show it to other people show it

1304
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:48,070
 

1305
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:50,040
 to people do who don't know your data

1306
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,040
 

1307
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:52,870
 don't know what you're trying to look at

1308
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:52,870
 

1309
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:54,630
 ask them is this working for you what do

1310
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,630
 

1311
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:58,770
 you see here okay

1312
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:58,770
 

1313
00:30:54,630 --> 00:31:01,480
 here's an example this is not about a

1314
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,480
 

1315
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:04,840
 visualization of data but this is a

1316
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:04,840
 

1317
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:08,380
 really complicated diagram of parts of a

1318
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:08,380
 

1319
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:10,660
 machine they're all labeled and so if I

1320
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:10,660
 

1321
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:13,750
 were to ask you okay can you can you

1322
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:13,750
 

1323
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:16,270
 find number and they are numbered right

1324
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:16,270
 

1325
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:20,650
 there are hundreds of parts if I were to

1326
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:20,650
 

1327
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:23,620
 ask you can you find number 57 it takes

1328
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,620
 

1329
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:27,160
 a while right one thing you could do is

1330
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:27,160
 

1331
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:29,710
 to layer things so now I'm using two

1332
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:29,710
 

1333
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:32,530
 different colors and again it's still a

1334
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,530
 

1335
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:34,540
 ton of stuff it's it's not gonna just

1336
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,540
 

1337
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:37,750
 number fifty seven is not gonna pop up

1338
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:37,750
 

1339
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:39,290
 to me but it's going to be much faster

1340
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,290
 

1341
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:41,600
 for me to just be like

1342
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,600
 

1343
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:43,280
 now I'm paying attention to numbers so

1344
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,280
 

1345
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,880
 I'm only paying attention to read things

1346
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:46,880
 

1347
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:49,910
 okay think about this as you're thinking

1348
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:49,910
 

1349
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:55,400
 about layering multiple pieces of

1350
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:55,400
 

1351
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:57,920
 information on your visualization okay

1352
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:57,920
 

1353
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:59,750
 what else can you do well you can your

1354
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:59,750
 

1355
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:02,530
 brain can calculate with visual

1356
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:02,530
 

1357
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:04,490
 information there's a whole set of

1358
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,490
 

1359
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:06,350
 perceptual research and you can also

1360
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,350
 

1361
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:08,300
 kind of sense this in yourself if you

1362
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,300
 

1363
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:11,000
 introspect one thing that is kind of

1364
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:11,000
 

1365
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:14,660
 fascinating is a set of work done by Dan

1366
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:14,660
 

1367
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:17,930
 Ariely where he showed that you can

1368
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:17,930
 

1369
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:19,790
 average visual variables so for example

1370
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,790
 

1371
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:22,730
 if you see a whole bunch of circles and

1372
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:22,730
 

1373
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:24,530
 then ask person to compare say show a

1374
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,530
 

1375
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:27,560
 person a single circle and say is that

1376
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,560
 

1377
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:29,990
 single circle bigger or smaller than the

1378
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,990
 

1379
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:32,270
 average size of that set people are

1380
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,270
 

1381
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:34,370
 extraordinarily accurate at this way

1382
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,370
 

1383
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:36,680
 more so than you would expect and they

1384
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,680
 

1385
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:38,060
 can do it very very quickly and it's an

1386
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:38,060
 

1387
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,830
 example basically of something you get

1388
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:39,830
 

1389
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:41,660
 for free it's like wow we just have this

1390
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,660
 

1391
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:42,920
 calculator in our head that you know if

1392
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:42,920
 

1393
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:44,270
 I gave you a whole set of numbers

1394
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:44,270
 

1395
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,280
 written down and asked you to calculate

1396
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,280
 

1397
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:48,950
 the average it would be kind of hard but

1398
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,950
 

1399
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:51,350
 your eye can do this very quickly um you

1400
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:51,350
 

1401
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:52,670
 can use this to do weighted averages as

1402
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,670
 

1403
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:57,110
 well and here I'm going to show you

1404
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:57,110
 

1405
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:59,620
 rather than a piece of psychology I'm

1406
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,620
 

1407
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:59,620
 going to show you

1408
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:07,960
 

1409
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:13,120
 well chrome comeback

1410
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:17,860
 

1411
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:23,090
 we're hoping it's good ah there we go

1412
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,090
 

1413
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:25,610
 okay good the internet gods have smiled

1414
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,610
 

1415
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:30,110
 on this okay so this is a visualization

1416
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,110
 

1417
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:31,250
 of the stock market this is something

1418
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,250
 

1419
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:33,289
 there's actually a whole traditional

1420
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,289
 

1421
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:35,480
 visualizing the stock market in this way

1422
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,480
 

1423
00:33:33,289 --> 00:33:37,730
 which I'm fond of because I it's one of

1424
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:37,730
 

1425
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:42,490
 the places where I started my career but

1426
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:42,490
 

1427
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:42,490
 this is not created by I either of us

1428
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:45,990
 

1429
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,049
 there okay

1430
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:51,049
 

1431
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:53,000
 gone all right and what you're saying is

1432
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,000
 

1433
00:33:51,049 --> 00:33:55,940
 is essentially hundreds of publicly

1434
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:55,940
 

1435
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,820
 traded companies on each rectangle

1436
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:58,820
 

1437
00:33:55,940 --> 00:34:01,130
 represents a company the area of a

1438
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:01,130
 

1439
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:03,260
 rectangle represents the market

1440
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,260
 

1441
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:04,880
 capitalization the color tells you how

1442
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,880
 

1443
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:06,620
 it's doing in the market today so I'm

1444
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:06,620
 

1445
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:09,169
 happy to say the market overall looks

1446
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:09,169
 

1447
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:11,839
 sort of reasonable Green is good

1448
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:11,839
 

1449
00:34:09,169 --> 00:34:13,639
 meaning it's gone up red is means has

1450
00:34:11,829 --> 00:34:13,639
 

1451
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:15,440
 gone down I think this would be an

1452
00:34:13,629 --> 00:34:15,440
 

1453
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:17,480
 example of something where you could

1454
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:17,480
 

1455
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,700
 quibble with the color scale this

1456
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:19,700
 

1457
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:23,480
 red-green color scale although it is

1458
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:23,480
 

1459
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:26,540
 classic for Wall Street is very bad for

1460
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:26,540
 

1461
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:28,220
 people who are colorblind so were i

1462
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:28,220
 

1463
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:29,599
 creating something like this in fact I

1464
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:29,599
 

1465
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:32,179
 was doing things like this at one point

1466
00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:32,179
 

1467
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:34,970
 we'd always have a sort of blue orange

1468
00:34:32,169 --> 00:34:34,970
 

1469
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:37,399
 or blue green blue yellow color scale as

1470
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,399
 

1471
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:38,810
 well but why does this work well one of

1472
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:38,810
 

1473
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:40,940
 the things that's nice about this is

1474
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,940
 

1475
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:43,609
 that all of these companies have been

1476
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:43,609
 

1477
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:46,190
 arranged by sector and by sub sector and

1478
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,190
 

1479
00:34:43,609 --> 00:34:48,919
 so that means that you can take a look

1480
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:48,919
 

1481
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:50,899
 at this and immediately see patterns you

1482
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:50,899
 

1483
00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:52,750
 can say aha okay so actually the tech

1484
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:52,750
 

1485
00:34:50,899 --> 00:34:55,220
 companies are doing pretty well overall

1486
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:55,220
 

1487
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:57,139
 you sort of average that out to green

1488
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:57,139
 

1489
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:59,420
 but then you can also see wait there's

1490
00:34:57,129 --> 00:34:59,420
 

1491
00:34:57,139 --> 00:35:01,910
 one little section that as a whole is

1492
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:01,910
 

1493
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:03,440
 not doing that bad well and meanwhile

1494
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,440
 

1495
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:05,630
 there's a bunch of like very mixed

1496
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:05,630
 

1497
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,790
 activity up here in basic materials and

1498
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,790
 

1499
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:10,430
 so forth so this technique calls a

1500
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:10,430
 

1501
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:12,200
 treatment called a treemap uses your

1502
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,200
 

1503
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:14,960
 eyes ability to see these sort of

1504
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:14,960
 

1505
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:16,849
 averages essentially and do a lot of

1506
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:16,849
 

1507
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,500
 calculations very quickly again if you

1508
00:35:16,839 --> 00:35:18,500
 

1509
00:35:16,849 --> 00:35:20,060
 compare this the alternative looking at

1510
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:20,060
 

1511
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:22,670
 the stock quote pages in an

1512
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:22,670
 

1513
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:26,660
 old-fashioned printed newspaper it would

1514
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:26,660
 

1515
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:29,540
 not nearly be not nearly as good okay so

1516
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:29,540
 

1517
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:31,820
 that is weighted averages on other

1518
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:31,820
 

1519
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:34,550
 things we can do so there's

1520
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:34,550
 

1521
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:35,840
 a famous diagram in astronomy the

1522
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,840
 

1523
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:38,680
 hertzsprung-russell diagram that

1524
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:38,680
 

1525
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:41,450
 essentially is plotting four stars on

1526
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:41,450
 

1527
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:43,490
 luminosity versus heat and various

1528
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,490
 

1529
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:44,990
 versions of this diagram have existed

1530
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,990
 

1531
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:46,400
 for more than a hundred years this is

1532
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,400
 

1533
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:48,740
 actually I think one of the very first

1534
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:48,740
 

1535
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,600
 scatter plots you scientifically you see

1536
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,600
 

1537
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:52,970
 a modern version here now what's

1538
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,970
 

1539
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:55,070
 interesting about this is that when you

1540
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,070
 

1541
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:58,100
 make this plot you see a very clear

1542
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:58,100
 

1543
00:35:55,070 --> 00:36:00,110
 pattern right there's this sort of long

1544
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:00,110
 

1545
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:01,880
 thing here is typically astronomers

1546
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,880
 

1547
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:04,160
 called the main-sequence there's many

1548
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:04,160
 

1549
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:06,290
 many stars in this area but it's not a

1550
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:06,290
 

1551
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,180
 line it's a little bit you know wavy and

1552
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,180
 

1553
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:09,590
 then there are these clusters up here

1554
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:09,590
 

1555
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:11,210
 and then there's actually a very sparse

1556
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,210
 

1557
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:14,270
 sequence down there that you can find

1558
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,270
 

1559
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:16,580
 and your eye just picks this up

1560
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:16,580
 

1561
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:18,350
 immediately it's like you see this

1562
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:18,350
 

1563
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:20,300
 probability distribution essentially

1564
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,300
 

1565
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:21,890
 right away and you don't see this as a

1566
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:21,890
 

1567
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:24,320
 set of dots you really do see this as

1568
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,320
 

1569
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:26,450
 like ah okay it's very dense here it's

1570
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:26,450
 

1571
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,620
 less dense there really your brain is

1572
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,620
 

1573
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:30,770
 essentially doing kernel density

1574
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:30,770
 

1575
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:32,150
 estimation and it's doing it for free so

1576
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,150
 

1577
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:34,640
 again something that you can take

1578
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,640
 

1579
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:36,260
 advantage I very effectively okay the

1580
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,260
 

1581
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,810
 final thing is how do visualizations

1582
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:38,810
 

1583
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:41,000
 work on computers what is added beyond

1584
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,000
 

1585
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:43,430
 the static kind of image we have and

1586
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:43,430
 

1587
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,070
 they're they're a couple of key things

1588
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:46,070
 

1589
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:48,290
 on interaction is the main one and then

1590
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:48,290
 

1591
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:49,820
 also on the web helping people converse

1592
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,820
 

1593
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:51,620
 and collaborate we won't be talking

1594
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:51,620
 

1595
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:55,160
 about that as much but I do want to talk

1596
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:55,160
 

1597
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:56,540
 a little bit about interaction so there

1598
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,540
 

1599
00:36:55,160 --> 00:37:00,230
 are a couple of ways of thinking about

1600
00:36:56,530 --> 00:37:00,230
 

1601
00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:01,790
 interaction one of my favorite practical

1602
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,790
 

1603
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:03,440
 things again is more than twenty years

1604
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,440
 

1605
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:05,570
 old it comes from ben shneiderman

1606
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,570
 

1607
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,820
 he calls it a mantra that when you are

1608
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,820
 

1609
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:09,260
 thinking about a visualization you think

1610
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:09,260
 

1611
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:11,990
 okay I'm gonna design this so that

1612
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:11,990
 

1613
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:14,270
 people get an overview first then they

1614
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,270
 

1615
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:17,540
 can zoom and filter and then they're get

1616
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:17,540
 

1617
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:20,210
 details-on-demand if they want and as we

1618
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:20,210
 

1619
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:22,310
 show visualizations today we will prefer

1620
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,310
 

1621
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:24,500
 back to this at various points it's

1622
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,500
 

1623
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:26,540
 funny he actually uh you know thought

1624
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:26,540
 

1625
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:28,340
 this was so important that he wrote this

1626
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:28,340
 

1627
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:29,990
 article where he had repeated this

1628
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:29,990
 

1629
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:31,670
 monitor over and over again for every

1630
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,670
 

1631
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:35,050
 project work he's forgotten it and was

1632
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:35,050
 

1633
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:36,670
 unhappy I'm gonna show a demo

1634
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,670
 

1635
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:42,220
 Oh actually you know we had might have

1636
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:42,220
 

1637
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:46,810
 that already yeah okay and let's go

1638
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:46,810
 

1639
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:51,100
 fullscreen okay this shows us so here we

1640
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,100
 

1641
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:53,860
 have a map that is showing essentially

1642
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:53,860
 

1643
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:58,060
 every person in the United States this

1644
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:58,060
 

1645
00:37:53,860 --> 00:38:01,060
 is based on census data and from 2010

1646
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:01,060
 

1647
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:03,130
 and you can see right away you get this

1648
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:03,130
 

1649
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:05,110
 overview you sort of see the shape of

1650
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,110
 

1651
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:06,670
 the US by the way we've looked for one

1652
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,670
 

1653
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:08,700
 for Canada and unfortunately doesn't

1654
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,700
 

1655
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:10,870
 exist there is one for Brazil though

1656
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:10,870
 

1657
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:13,540
 what you're seeing here is each dot

1658
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,540
 

1659
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:15,190
 represents a person and the location of

1660
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:15,190
 

1661
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:16,510
 the dot it's not quite down to the House

1662
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,510
 

1663
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:18,790
 level I think that would be an invasion

1664
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,790
 

1665
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:21,040
 of privacy and the census doesn't make

1666
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:21,040
 

1667
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:22,420
 that level of data available for 2010

1668
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,420
 

1669
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,070
 but it's very close it's down

1670
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:24,070
 

1671
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:27,040
 essentially to a neighborhood level and

1672
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:27,040
 

1673
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:28,930
 the color of the dot tells you that the

1674
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:28,930
 

1675
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:31,650
 the race that the person who filled out

1676
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,650
 

1677
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:34,390
 the census form identified with and

1678
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,390
 

1679
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:36,280
 immediately just looking at this you've

1680
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,280
 

1681
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:38,920
 got this overview this you can start to

1682
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:38,920
 

1683
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:40,750
 see like okay there's these broad swaths

1684
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:40,750
 

1685
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,760
 of blue in the middle of the country

1686
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,760
 

1687
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:44,020
 that corresponds to white you can but

1688
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:44,020
 

1689
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:47,020
 you can see sort of these much more

1690
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:47,020
 

1691
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:49,450
 colorful areas where their cities let's

1692
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:49,450
 

1693
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:52,780
 say I think a bunch of people are from

1694
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,780
 

1695
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:56,400
 California I'm guessing so now comes

1696
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:56,400
 

1697
00:38:52,780 --> 00:39:02,250
 we've seen the overview let's zoom in

1698
00:38:56,390 --> 00:39:02,250
 

1699
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:06,490
 and you actually can start to see let's

1700
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,490
 

1701
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:08,380
 go to San Francisco for example and you

1702
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,380
 

1703
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:11,770
 can start to see actually very strong

1704
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:11,770
 

1705
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:14,590
 patterns of it's not equally mixed

1706
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,590
 

1707
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:16,770
 there's a clear sort of housing

1708
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,770
 

1709
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:16,770
 segregation

1710
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:17,630
 

1711
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:22,589
 if I add the math labels you can

1712
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:22,589
 

1713
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:24,839
 actually get some streets you can start

1714
00:39:22,579 --> 00:39:24,839
 

1715
00:39:22,589 --> 00:39:26,369
 to see neighborhoods and you can start

1716
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:26,369
 

1717
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:29,280
 to see essentially a lot of the history

1718
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:29,280
 

1719
00:39:26,369 --> 00:39:32,010
 of the United States and including some

1720
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:32,010
 

1721
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,470
 fairly unfortunate history written in to

1722
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,470
 

1723
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:37,520
 the census that we see today and this is

1724
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:37,520
 

1725
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:40,319
 something that I think is an incredibly

1726
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:40,319
 

1727
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:43,069
 interesting map you can see all sorts of

1728
00:39:40,309 --> 00:39:43,069
 

1729
00:39:40,319 --> 00:39:46,380
 you every city has its own particular

1730
00:39:43,059 --> 00:39:46,380
 

1731
00:39:43,069 --> 00:39:49,050
 thumbprint you can see the if Chicago is

1732
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:49,050
 

1733
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:51,210
 another very very interesting one and

1734
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,210
 

1735
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:54,270
 the idea is that you can very seamlessly

1736
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,270
 

1737
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:56,609
 move between the big view of the whole

1738
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:56,609
 

1739
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:59,160
 country and the small view all the way

1740
00:39:56,599 --> 00:39:59,160
 

1741
00:39:56,609 --> 00:40:00,660
 down to sort of individual dots and if

1742
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,660
 

1743
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:02,790
 you do want details if you do want these

1744
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:02,790
 

1745
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:05,280
 labels you can just add them in and I

1746
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:05,280
 

1747
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:14,760
 think this is sort of a great example of

1748
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:14,760
 

1749
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:16,559
 that type of transition just one more

1750
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,559
 

1751
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:21,119
 thing I want to add here that I think is

1752
00:40:16,549 --> 00:40:21,119
 

1753
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:22,920
 interesting is this visualization is

1754
00:40:21,109 --> 00:40:22,920
 

1755
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:26,130
 again taking advantage of those

1756
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:26,130
 

1757
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:28,819
 superpowers so I just took out all of

1758
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,819
 

1759
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:32,660
 the map information there is no map here

1760
00:40:28,809 --> 00:40:32,660
 

1761
00:40:28,819 --> 00:40:37,220
 literally it's a bunch of dots on white

1762
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:37,220
 

1763
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:40,559
 and yet it looks like a map right

1764
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:40,559
 

1765
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:44,099
 because our eyes are doing the gestalt

1766
00:40:40,549 --> 00:40:44,099
 

1767
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:47,190
 thing of closure so when I start putting

1768
00:40:44,089 --> 00:40:47,190
 

1769
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:50,369
 things close enough our eyes just fill

1770
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:50,369
 

1771
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:53,099
 in the blanks that's why we can see

1772
00:40:50,359 --> 00:40:53,099
 

1773
00:40:50,369 --> 00:40:55,319
 shapes but basically I'm just drawing a

1774
00:40:53,089 --> 00:40:55,319
 

1775
00:40:53,099 --> 00:40:58,380
 bunch of dots on a white background I

1776
00:40:55,309 --> 00:40:58,380
 

1777
00:40:55,319 --> 00:41:00,930
 don't have a map and yet it totally

1778
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:00,930
 

1779
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:04,290
 looks like a map right so think about

1780
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:04,290
 

1781
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:07,549
 the power again you cannot not see this

1782
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,549
 

1783
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:07,549
 you see it

1784
00:41:12,819 --> 00:41:12,819
 

1785
00:41:12,829 --> 00:41:15,640
 all right

1786
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:15,810
 

1787
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:21,370
 okay so let's talk a little bit about

1788
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:21,370
 

1789
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:23,020
 how you put these together one thing

1790
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,020
 

1791
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:25,330
 that we thought would be really nice to

1792
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:25,330
 

1793
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:27,700
 do actually is to talk about peoples of

1794
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,700
 

1795
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:29,530
 numbers because every time we've talked

1796
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:29,530
 

1797
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:31,090
 to machine learning teams and we spent a

1798
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,090
 

1799
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:32,680
 lot of time inside of google talking to

1800
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,680
 

1801
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:34,960
 different teams working with ml in

1802
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:34,960
 

1803
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:36,760
 various forms and sometimes they come to

1804
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,760
 

1805
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,500
 us and ask for visualizations often

1806
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:38,500
 

1807
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:41,530
 they've seen something very fancy and

1808
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:41,530
 

1809
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:43,180
 they want something very fancy but quite

1810
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,180
 

1811
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:45,250
 often you look at what they're actually

1812
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:45,250
 

1813
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:47,260
 seeing day to day and it's tables of

1814
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,260
 

1815
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:50,470
 numbers and those numbers are important

1816
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:50,470
 

1817
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:52,090
 and they're really hard to read and so

1818
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,090
 

1819
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:53,650
 one of the things that I believe is that

1820
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,650
 

1821
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:55,750
 almost the first thing you should try

1822
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,750
 

1823
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:58,030
 and thinking about making any data

1824
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:58,030
 

1825
00:41:55,750 --> 00:42:00,100
 display you have better is to redesign

1826
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:00,100
 

1827
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:01,780
 your tables and there's actually a

1828
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:01,780
 

1829
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:03,430
 beautiful video from a place called

1830
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:03,430
 

1831
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:05,590
 darkhorse analytics that we'd like to

1832
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,590
 

1833
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:09,270
 show that sort of illustrates that's

1834
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:09,270
 

1835
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:09,270
 about as well as anything I've ever seen

1836
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:09,650
 

1837
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:15,630
 we're gonna hope the internet gods will

1838
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:15,630
 

1839
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:15,630
 pay for us once again on this

1840
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:19,800
 

1841
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:25,840
 okay so they start out with his bad

1842
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:25,840
 

1843
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:28,870
 table they remove colors removed

1844
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:28,870
 

1845
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:35,920
 gridlines in fact they remove all those

1846
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:35,920
 

1847
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:37,870
 fills no borders look at watch this

1848
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:37,870
 

1849
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:44,740
 alignment it's like you breathe easy

1850
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:44,740
 

1851
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:48,820
 when things get aligned oh yes let's

1852
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:48,820
 

1853
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:53,200
 resize those columns please oh look the

1854
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:53,200
 

1855
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:55,120
 white space is working for us look at

1856
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:55,120
 

1857
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:59,040
 them rounding the numbers look how much

1858
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:59,040
 

1859
00:42:55,120 --> 00:43:01,360
 better that is round your numbers folks

1860
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:01,360
 

1861
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:03,040
 they don't like that font that's not the

1862
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:03,040
 

1863
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:06,850
 worst thing in here and then you can add

1864
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:06,850
 

1865
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:09,310
 emphasis once you have things yeah we're

1866
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,310
 

1867
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:10,630
 gonna leave it again cuz it's fast but

1868
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,630
 

1869
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:12,100
 that's normal right like that looked

1870
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,100
 

1871
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:16,240
 like a normal thing but this is the N

1872
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:16,240
 

1873
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:20,130
 table so think about how many things

1874
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:20,130
 

1875
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:20,130
 they removed from the default

1876
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:32,720
 

1877
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:37,940
 they left allowing some columns and

1878
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,940
 

1879
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:40,770
 right-aligned others that's interesting

1880
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:40,770
 

1881
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:43,560
 they write a line numbers because it's

1882
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,560
 

1883
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:45,960
 easy easier visually for me to scan

1884
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:45,960
 

1885
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:48,120
 numbers that are right aligned but it's

1886
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:48,120
 

1887
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:50,420
 easier for me to scan text that is left

1888
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:50,420
 

1889
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,420
 aligned

1890
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:56,190
 

1891
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:00,720
 yeah so even though this is again

1892
00:43:59,819 --> 00:44:00,720
 

1893
00:43:59,829 --> 00:44:02,559
 probably not the most glamorous

1894
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:02,559
 

1895
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,930
 visualization you've seen all day I do

1896
00:44:02,549 --> 00:44:04,930
 

1897
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:06,670
 think that this is like 90 percent of

1898
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,670
 

1899
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:09,430
 the time you can get a genuine

1900
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:09,430
 

1901
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:10,750
 improvement in any data display system

1902
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:10,750
 

1903
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:18,210
 you have by just following these

1904
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:18,210
 

1905
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:21,160
 principles all right all right so now

1906
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,160
 

1907
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:23,079
 some were common techniques that we

1908
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:23,079
 

1909
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:26,530
 think could be very helpful in machine

1910
00:44:23,069 --> 00:44:26,530
 

1911
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:29,470
 learning land when you have a ton of

1912
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,470
 

1913
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:31,780
 data high density there's something

1914
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,780
 

1915
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:36,160
 called in small multiples which is

1916
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:36,160
 

1917
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:38,410
 basically you repeat your chart over and

1918
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:38,410
 

1919
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:41,200
 over again for each moment that is

1920
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,200
 

1921
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:43,210
 important so what we're showing here is

1922
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:43,210
 

1923
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:46,410
 a visualization that was on the New York

1924
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,410
 

1925
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:50,079
 Times for a drought in the US over

1926
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,079
 

1927
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:54,040
 decades so each one of these rows is a

1928
00:44:50,069 --> 00:44:54,040
 

1929
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:56,890
 decade's worth of drought in the US okay

1930
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:56,890
 

1931
00:44:54,040 --> 00:45:00,520
 and the question that the article was

1932
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,520
 

1933
00:44:56,890 --> 00:45:03,130
 asking is are we having more droughts

1934
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:03,130
 

1935
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:03,940
 today than we've had in the past you be

1936
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:03,940
 

1937
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:05,980
 the judge

1938
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:05,980
 

1939
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:07,900
 so there is a temporal dimension here

1940
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:07,900
 

1941
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:10,450
 but they unpacked this temporal

1942
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:10,450
 

1943
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:12,880
 dimension so that you could have this

1944
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,880
 

1945
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:15,579
 matrix okay so you can keep scanning

1946
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:15,579
 

1947
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:17,559
 over and over again now another thing I

1948
00:45:15,569 --> 00:45:17,559
 

1949
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:19,990
 want to call attention to here think

1950
00:45:17,549 --> 00:45:19,990
 

1951
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:23,500
 about the color I have a background

1952
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:23,500
 

1953
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:25,480
 color that is very faint so that my map

1954
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:25,480
 

1955
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:28,240
 of the US recedes into the background

1956
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:28,240
 

1957
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:30,490
 because you know what my map is not the

1958
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:30,490
 

1959
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:33,069
 most important thing it is the context

1960
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,069
 

1961
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:35,559
 so it is important but the drought

1962
00:45:33,059 --> 00:45:35,559
 

1963
00:45:33,069 --> 00:45:38,859
 information is what I want to pop up and

1964
00:45:35,549 --> 00:45:38,859
 

1965
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:42,400
 so the really highlighting saturated

1966
00:45:38,849 --> 00:45:42,400
 

1967
00:45:38,859 --> 00:45:44,710
 color is only for the drought so now I'm

1968
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:44,710
 

1969
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,780
 playing with receding to the background

1970
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,780
 

1971
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:49,599
 and coming to the foreground with the

1972
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:49,599
 

1973
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:51,940
 highlighted color here's another one

1974
00:45:49,589 --> 00:45:51,940
 

1975
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:55,780
 that works very much the same way this

1976
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:55,780
 

1977
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:59,470
 is patterns of birds what exists today

1978
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:59,470
 

1979
00:45:55,780 --> 00:46:03,339
 in blue and probably where they will

1980
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:03,339
 

1981
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:05,280
 exist in many years if climate change

1982
00:46:03,329 --> 00:46:05,280
 

1983
00:46:03,339 --> 00:46:07,350
 continues

1984
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:07,350
 

1985
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:10,350
 but again think about how many numbers

1986
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:10,350
 

1987
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:12,360
 worth of data this is and again the same

1988
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:12,360
 

1989
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:15,420
 kind of visual encoding with the map

1990
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:15,420
 

1991
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:19,470
 very faint in the background to give me

1992
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:19,470
 

1993
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:23,340
 context and these now two layers of data

1994
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:23,340
 

1995
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:25,560
 at the same time the last thing I want

1996
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:25,560
 

1997
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:28,200
 to call attention to is this notion of

1998
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:28,200
 

1999
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:29,850
 faceting so we're gonna go to this New

2000
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:29,850
 

2001
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,950
 York Times by the way the New York Times

2002
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,950
 

2003
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:35,780
 is an amazing powerhouse of data

2004
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:35,780
 

2005
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:38,520
 visualization and so I highly recommend

2006
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:38,520
 

2007
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:40,730
 looking at some of the work they do but

2008
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:40,730
 

2009
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:43,410
 this is this is basically looking

2010
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,410
 

2011
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:46,830
 visualizing a ton of companies across

2012
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,830
 

2013
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:48,930
 the US and how much tax what are the tax

2014
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:48,930
 

2015
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:52,020
 rates for these companies and how much

2016
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:52,020
 

2017
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:54,840
 variance there is in the tax rates each

2018
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:54,840
 

2019
00:46:52,020 --> 00:47:00,090
 one of these circles is a company ok

2020
00:46:54,830 --> 00:47:00,090
 

2021
00:46:54,840 --> 00:47:02,510
 sized differently by and I can tell you

2022
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,510
 

2023
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:07,110
 here what it is because it has a legend

2024
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:07,110
 

2025
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:10,340
 legends yes important labels important

2026
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:10,340
 

2027
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:13,080
 always always label your data and

2028
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:13,080
 

2029
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:15,240
 explain the legend so the market

2030
00:47:13,070 --> 00:47:15,240
 

2031
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:16,650
 capitalization I didn't have to memorize

2032
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:16,650
 

2033
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:19,800
 this I could just come here and look

2034
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,800
 

2035
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:22,110
 before I tell you the color is also here

2036
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:22,110
 

2037
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:24,510
 right but look at this interesting thing

2038
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:24,510
 

2039
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:27,510
 that they did with the color they are

2040
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,510
 

2041
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:31,920
 already showing me a distribution that

2042
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:31,920
 

2043
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:35,040
 goes from the lowest tax rate on the

2044
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:35,040
 

2045
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:37,860
 left to the highest tax rates on the

2046
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:37,860
 

2047
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:39,630
 right so just by looking at this

2048
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:39,630
 

2049
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:41,700
 distribution I know that things are

2050
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:41,700
 

2051
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:44,430
 going up the further to the right they

2052
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:44,430
 

2053
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:49,170
 are but then they went one step further

2054
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:49,170
 

2055
00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:51,990
 they bend things with colors for me okay

2056
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:51,990
 

2057
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:56,880
 so these colors are just binning things

2058
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:56,880
 

2059
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:59,220
 and the binning is is explained here all

2060
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:59,220
 

2061
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,420
 right they did another thing that is

2062
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:00,420
 

2063
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:04,170
 just helping me

2064
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:04,170
 

2065
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:07,740
 they actually calculated here the

2066
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,740
 

2067
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:10,920
 overall average tax rate for the entire

2068
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:10,920
 

2069
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:13,589
 distribution right so again they are

2070
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:13,589
 

2071
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:16,260
 hacking a ton of information into this

2072
00:48:13,579 --> 00:48:16,260
 

2073
00:48:13,589 --> 00:48:17,940
 graph there's a bunch more explanation

2074
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:17,940
 

2075
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:20,520
 here but then there is this beautiful

2076
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:20,520
 

2077
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:23,099
 thing they do which is these are all the

2078
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:23,099
 

2079
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:25,170
 companies together now I'm gonna click

2080
00:48:23,089 --> 00:48:25,170
 

2081
00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:29,640
 this button and I'm gonna see it by

2082
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:29,640
 

2083
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:33,660
 industry and it just does this beautiful

2084
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:33,660
 

2085
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:36,630
 waterfall by industry now again they are

2086
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:36,630
 

2087
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:40,140
 showing me the distribution but now they

2088
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:40,140
 

2089
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:42,329
 are calculating that average line for

2090
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:42,329
 

2091
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:44,940
 each one of these industry sections

2092
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:44,940
 

2093
00:48:42,329 --> 00:48:48,079
 which is awesome and they have a little

2094
00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:48,079
 

2095
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:50,520
 commentary for each one of those two

2096
00:48:48,069 --> 00:48:50,520
 

2097
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:54,170
 showing me things that are interesting

2098
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:54,170
 

2099
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:59,309
 they are also arranging these by the way

2100
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:59,309
 

2101
00:48:54,170 --> 00:49:01,770
 in in Crescent order right so I'm going

2102
00:48:59,299 --> 00:49:01,770
 

2103
00:48:59,309 --> 00:49:06,599
 from the from utilities which has the

2104
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:06,599
 

2105
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:10,380
 lowest average to insurance which has

2106
00:49:06,589 --> 00:49:10,380
 

2107
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:15,410
 the highest average okay so really

2108
00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:15,410
 

2109
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:15,410
 nicely done ton of information here

2110
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:18,760
 

2111
00:49:18,770 --> 00:49:27,590
 okay okay so all of this so far has been

2112
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:27,590
 

2113
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:29,680
 just general visualization information

2114
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:29,680
 

2115
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:31,850
 let's talk a little bit about

2116
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:31,850
 

2117
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:33,590
 visualization in machine learning so

2118
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,590
 

2119
00:49:31,850 --> 00:49:36,620
 what you see here is the visualization

2120
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:36,620
 

2121
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:38,810
 pipeline this is a slide that I've taken

2122
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:38,810
 

2123
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:41,780
 from Yannick ahsoka someone in our group

2124
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,780
 

2125
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:44,720
 who actually realized that if you look

2126
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:44,720
 

2127
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:46,790
 at the pipeline of machine learning you

2128
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:46,790
 

2129
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:49,430
 can identify where visualization may be

2130
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:49,430
 

2131
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:51,320
 especially helpful on its thinking about

2132
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:51,320
 

2133
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:53,090
 terms of acquiring data it's as you

2134
00:49:51,310 --> 00:49:53,090
 

2135
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:55,700
 implement a model as you between

2136
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:55,700
 

2137
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:58,490
 training and when you deploy it for

2138
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:58,490
 

2139
00:49:55,700 --> 00:50:00,950
 monitoring and so that's essentially a

2140
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,950
 

2141
00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:04,190
 framework that we'd like to use as we

2142
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:04,190
 

2143
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:05,800
 talk through machine learning so we've

2144
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:05,800
 

2145
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:09,230
 got we're gonna talk a lot about

2146
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:09,230
 

2147
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:10,670
 visualizing training data we will very

2148
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:10,670
 

2149
00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:13,070
 very briefly talk about model

2150
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:13,070
 

2151
00:50:10,670 --> 00:50:14,570
 performance and then we'll talk about

2152
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:14,570
 

2153
00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:16,460
 interpretability and the model

2154
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,460
 

2155
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:19,250
 inspection kind of trying to crack open

2156
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:19,250
 

2157
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:21,800
 the so-called black box we'll think

2158
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,800
 

2159
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:23,660
 about high dimensional data and then I

2160
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:23,660
 

2161
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:25,730
 think education and a communication

2162
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:25,730
 

2163
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:28,460
 scientific communication is incredibly

2164
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:28,460
 

2165
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:30,950
 important in a lot of ways and

2166
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:30,950
 

2167
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:32,950
 visualization is a perfect match for

2168
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:32,950
 

2169
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:38,660
 that particular task

2170
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:38,660
 

2171
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:40,970
 alright so visualizing training data one

2172
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:40,970
 

2173
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:45,200
 of the things this is some work we did a

2174
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:45,200
 

2175
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:47,930
 while ago and we realized that there are

2176
00:50:45,190 --> 00:50:47,930
 

2177
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:50,210
 there's a dearth of good tools for just

2178
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,210
 

2179
00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:55,040
 looking at your data your training data

2180
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:55,040
 

2181
00:50:50,210 --> 00:51:00,080
 so we looked at a how do you visualize

2182
00:50:55,030 --> 00:51:00,080
 

2183
00:50:55,040 --> 00:51:02,660
 very simply something like CFR 10 and so

2184
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:02,660
 

2185
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:06,740
 we created this let me see if I can

2186
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:06,740
 

2187
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:09,500
 enter full screen here so this is called

2188
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:09,500
 

2189
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:12,080
 facets and it's nothing more than

2190
00:51:09,490 --> 00:51:12,080
 

2191
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:14,270
 looking at your pictures from CFR 10 so

2192
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:14,270
 

2193
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:16,730
 I have all my images here this is not

2194
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:16,730
 

2195
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:19,460
 the data set in its entirety but it's a

2196
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,460
 

2197
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:22,010
 good chunk of the data set and I'm just

2198
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:22,010
 

2199
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:25,010
 organizing my pictures by the categories

2200
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,010
 

2201
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:27,590
 in C frightened immediately I can see

2202
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,590
 

2203
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:28,370
 things like oh differences in hues okay

2204
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:28,370
 

2205
00:51:27,590 --> 00:51:30,910
 makes sense

2206
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,910
 

2207
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:34,000
 airplanes are more probably going to

2208
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:34,000
 

2209
00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:36,099
 in the Blue Zone and so our ships versus

2210
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:36,099
 

2211
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,900
 birds for instance but then the other

2212
00:51:36,089 --> 00:51:37,900
 

2213
00:51:36,099 --> 00:51:39,789
 thing I can do is I can start playing

2214
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:39,789
 

2215
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:43,390
 with this I can start zooming in very

2216
00:51:39,779 --> 00:51:43,390
 

2217
00:51:39,789 --> 00:51:46,049
 quickly and just making sure that my

2218
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:46,049
 

2219
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:48,940
 data set looks right and that you know

2220
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:48,940
 

2221
00:51:46,049 --> 00:51:50,769
 half of my data set is in blank for

2222
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:50,769
 

2223
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:54,119
 instance even that at this point is it

2224
00:51:50,759 --> 00:51:54,119
 

2225
00:51:50,769 --> 00:51:57,039
 is interesting another thing I can do is

2226
00:51:54,109 --> 00:51:57,039
 

2227
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:59,259
 I can start playing some games so now I

2228
00:51:57,029 --> 00:51:59,259
 

2229
00:51:57,039 --> 00:52:01,240
 want to see the same visualization the

2230
00:51:59,249 --> 00:52:01,240
 

2231
00:51:59,259 --> 00:52:03,519
 same data but I want to see the hue

2232
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:03,519
 

2233
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:05,859
 distribution within each one of the

2234
00:52:03,509 --> 00:52:05,859
 

2235
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:08,589
 classes and then again I can see okay

2236
00:52:05,849 --> 00:52:08,589
 

2237
00:52:05,859 --> 00:52:11,859
 all right airplanes and ships big bulge

2238
00:52:08,579 --> 00:52:11,859
 

2239
00:52:08,589 --> 00:52:14,710
 of blue there versus the animals here

2240
00:52:11,849 --> 00:52:14,710
 

2241
00:52:11,859 --> 00:52:18,069
 which are you know earth tones make

2242
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:18,069
 

2243
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:21,190
 sense other things we can start to do is

2244
00:52:18,059 --> 00:52:21,190
 

2245
00:52:18,069 --> 00:52:22,930
 to create a confusion matrix and this is

2246
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:22,930
 

2247
00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:24,400
 so cool this is the kind of audience I

2248
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:24,400
 

2249
00:52:22,930 --> 00:52:27,809
 don't have to explain a confusion matrix

2250
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:27,809
 

2251
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:30,670
 to so good news Maya Maya diagonal is

2252
00:52:27,799 --> 00:52:30,670
 

2253
00:52:27,809 --> 00:52:34,000
 highly populated that's awesome

2254
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:34,000
 

2255
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:36,579
 but now what I want to do is I want to

2256
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:36,579
 

2257
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:39,250
 take out that diagonal I want to take

2258
00:52:36,569 --> 00:52:39,250
 

2259
00:52:36,579 --> 00:52:41,859
 out all the right stuff and boom I have

2260
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,859
 

2261
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:45,160
 all the mistakes that my system has made

2262
00:52:41,849 --> 00:52:45,160
 

2263
00:52:41,859 --> 00:52:47,799
 and immediately I can see that there are

2264
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:47,799
 

2265
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:51,069
 two selves here that are highly

2266
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:51,069
 

2267
00:52:47,799 --> 00:52:54,849
 populated right and they happen to be

2268
00:52:51,059 --> 00:52:54,849
 

2269
00:52:51,069 --> 00:52:58,059
 the cells that are mixing up cats and

2270
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:58,059
 

2271
00:52:54,849 --> 00:53:01,650
 dogs okay so that tells me something

2272
00:52:58,049 --> 00:53:01,650
 

2273
00:52:58,059 --> 00:53:06,630
 about the kinds of mistakes my my system

2274
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:06,630
 

2275
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:09,269
 is starting to make go away all right

2276
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:09,269
 

2277
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:13,480
 another thing I want to show is this

2278
00:53:09,259 --> 00:53:13,480
 

2279
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:15,880
 visualization of the softmax layer and

2280
00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:15,880
 

2281
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:17,980
 what's happening here I just want to see

2282
00:53:15,870 --> 00:53:17,980
 

2283
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:21,460
 the distribution and so the more to the

2284
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:21,460
 

2285
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:24,490
 right an image is the more certain my

2286
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:24,490
 

2287
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:28,869
 system is that that image is indeed an

2288
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,869
 

2289
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:32,319
 airplane or a dog or a cat but likewise

2290
00:53:28,859 --> 00:53:32,319
 

2291
00:53:28,869 --> 00:53:34,020
 the more to the left the more likely the

2292
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:34,020
 

2293
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:36,300
 more certain my

2294
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:36,300
 

2295
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:39,600
 system is that that image is not an

2296
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:39,600
 

2297
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:41,100
 airplane or not a cat okay and so we

2298
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:41,100
 

2299
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:44,010
 were immediately looked at this were

2300
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:44,010
 

2301
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:46,260
 like Oh cats that is the biggest one

2302
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,260
 

2303
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:48,780
 that my system is very very sure about

2304
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:48,780
 

2305
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:51,480
 so let's look into cat so we zoom in

2306
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:51,480
 

2307
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:54,570
 into cats and remember this is CFR ten

2308
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:54,570
 

2309
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:57,570
 so thousands of people have looked and

2310
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:57,570
 

2311
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:59,430
 played with this data set and so did we

2312
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:59,430
 

2313
00:53:57,570 --> 00:54:02,520
 and then we started looking and we're

2314
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:02,520
 

2315
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:04,230
 like oh look that's interesting these

2316
00:54:02,510 --> 00:54:04,230
 

2317
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:07,350
 are the cats my system is very sure in

2318
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:07,350
 

2319
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:13,830
 our cat are not cats and can you spot

2320
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:13,830
 

2321
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:17,760
 towards the bottom hint a non cat over

2322
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:17,760
 

2323
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:20,970
 here this guy has been labeled by humans

2324
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:20,970
 

2325
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:23,010
 as a cat and my system is very very sure

2326
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,010
 

2327
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:25,710
 it's a frog and I have to give it to my

2328
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,710
 

2329
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:27,210
 system I think it's a frog I don't think

2330
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:27,210
 

2331
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:29,430
 it's a cat at all I think it's a mistake

2332
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,430
 

2333
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:32,220
 right so this is interesting because

2334
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:32,220
 

2335
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:35,850
 just by visualizing and making your

2336
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:35,850
 

2337
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:37,560
 dataset very accessible chances are you

2338
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,560
 

2339
00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:41,880
 could start spotting more and you know

2340
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:41,880
 

2341
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:44,570
 mistakes and so this is one example of

2342
00:54:41,870 --> 00:54:44,570
 

2343
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:47,130
 how you might want to use visualization

2344
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:47,130
 

2345
00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:48,810
 to look at your training data I'm just

2346
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,810
 

2347
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:51,390
 gonna interject something which is that

2348
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,390
 

2349
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:54,120
 this really illustrates very well this

2350
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:54,120
 

2351
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:56,580
 idea of overview first zoom in this case

2352
00:54:54,110 --> 00:54:56,580
 

2353
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:58,770
 right literally zoom filter and then the

2354
00:54:56,570 --> 00:54:58,770
 

2355
00:54:56,580 --> 00:55:03,120
 details-on-demand to see the individual

2356
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:03,120
 

2357
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:05,610
 frog good point and and facets is

2358
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:05,610
 

2359
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:07,680
 available it's open source and so please

2360
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,680
 

2361
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:08,760
 feel free to download it use it make it

2362
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:08,760
 

2363
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:11,430
 better

2364
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:11,430
 

2365
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:12,840
 that's the idea there I want to call

2366
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:12,840
 

2367
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:14,850
 your attention to something I think was

2368
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:14,850
 

2369
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:17,190
 very cool that quick-draw did this is

2370
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:17,190
 

2371
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:20,010
 not our team's work everybody knows

2372
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:20,010
 

2373
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:21,750
 quick-draw here some people okay

2374
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,750
 

2375
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:24,030
 for those of you who have not heard of

2376
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:24,030
 

2377
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:26,850
 this please do not play it now it's a

2378
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:26,850
 

2379
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:28,350
 game you go on a noise and it makes

2380
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,350
 

2381
00:55:26,850 --> 00:55:30,480
 noise yeah and it's gonna make our

2382
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:30,480
 

2383
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:33,240
 internet really slow but basically

2384
00:55:30,470 --> 00:55:33,240
 

2385
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:36,030
 you're playing pictionary with a machine

2386
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:36,030
 

2387
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:38,070
 learning system it gives you 20 seconds

2388
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:38,070
 

2389
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:40,290
 it gives you something to draw and 20

2390
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:40,290
 

2391
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:42,480
 seconds to draw and it keeps trying to

2392
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,480
 

2393
00:55:40,290 --> 00:55:45,850
 guess what it is that you're drawing

2394
00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:45,850
 

2395
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:49,000
 okay and so what happens is that

2396
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:49,000
 

2397
00:55:45,850 --> 00:55:53,280
 this went viral and it created a huge

2398
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:53,280
 

2399
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:56,950
 data set of drawings of doodles and they

2400
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:56,950
 

2401
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:59,350
 open sourced the team open sourced this

2402
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:59,350
 

2403
00:55:56,950 --> 00:56:01,930
 data set and it's really cool because

2404
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:01,930
 

2405
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:03,580
 you can be like ooh onion okay I click

2406
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,580
 

2407
00:56:01,930 --> 00:56:06,910
 here I can see all the onions that

2408
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:06,910
 

2409
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:08,890
 people are you know drawing and and they

2410
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:08,890
 

2411
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:11,020
 actually show me the strokes and

2412
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,020
 

2413
00:56:08,890 --> 00:56:14,710
 everything but one of the things that

2414
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:14,710
 

2415
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:16,330
 this allowed that the team to do and

2416
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:16,330
 

2417
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:18,040
 other because they open sores to other

2418
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,040
 

2419
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:20,320
 people outside of the team started doing

2420
00:56:18,030 --> 00:56:20,320
 

2421
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:23,980
 this too is do some data analysis of the

2422
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:23,980
 

2423
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:27,490
 training data so things like if you

2424
00:56:23,970 --> 00:56:27,490
 

2425
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:29,200
 could overlay all of the cats that

2426
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:29,200
 

2427
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:32,920
 people from different countries have

2428
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:32,920
 

2429
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:34,900
 drawn you get things like these and you

2430
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:34,900
 

2431
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:37,690
 can get a sense that yeah people draw

2432
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:37,690
 

2433
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:38,830
 cats very very similarly across the

2434
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:38,830
 

2435
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:40,690
 globe that's great

2436
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:40,690
 

2437
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:43,000
 turns out that that's not true for

2438
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:43,000
 

2439
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:45,340
 everything turns out that chairs for

2440
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:45,340
 

2441
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:48,840
 instance are drawn very differently in

2442
00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:48,840
 

2443
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:53,380
 Korea than in Brazil where I'm from so

2444
00:56:48,830 --> 00:56:53,380
 

2445
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:56,940
 like I knew that this one I find really

2446
00:56:53,370 --> 00:56:56,940
 

2447
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:59,650
 interesting outlets and it's it's just

2448
00:56:56,930 --> 00:56:59,650
 

2449
00:56:56,940 --> 00:57:02,860
 very illustrative of where people are

2450
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:02,860
 

2451
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:05,260
 coming from so again this is another

2452
00:57:02,850 --> 00:57:05,260
 

2453
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:07,030
 kind of visualization for looking at

2454
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:07,030
 

2455
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:09,190
 your data set and starting to think

2456
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:09,190
 

2457
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:12,160
 about what are some of the questions

2458
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:12,160
 

2459
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:15,310
 that might be interesting there this is

2460
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:15,310
 

2461
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:18,240
 this is the same data set and they were

2462
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:18,240
 

2463
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:21,190
 looking at fish the category fish and so

2464
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:21,190
 

2465
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:24,580
 remember small multiples these are small

2466
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:24,580
 

2467
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:27,040
 multiples for each country okay and it's

2468
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:27,040
 

2469
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:30,990
 overlays and the cool thing is that you

2470
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:30,990
 

2471
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:34,630
 can see that in some countries the fish

2472
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:34,630
 

2473
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:36,810
 definitely face one direction okay and

2474
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:36,810
 

2475
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:39,550
 it's usually to the left

2476
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:39,550
 

2477
00:57:36,810 --> 00:57:42,580
 turkey turns out to be the only country

2478
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:42,580
 

2479
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:47,110
 where the fish very definitely faces the

2480
00:57:42,570 --> 00:57:47,110
 

2481
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:49,360
 other direction okay that's interesting

2482
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:49,360
 

2483
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:51,400
 nobody knew this but again think about

2484
00:57:49,350 --> 00:57:51,400
 

2485
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:52,310
 things like if you're training your

2486
00:57:51,390 --> 00:57:52,310
 

2487
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:55,250
 system

2488
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:55,250
 

2489
00:57:52,310 --> 00:57:57,680
 and you want to be aware of biases right

2490
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:57,680
 

2491
00:57:55,250 --> 00:58:01,490
 this would start to give you some notion

2492
00:57:57,670 --> 00:58:01,490
 

2493
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:04,130
 of oh is my fish always facing one way

2494
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:04,130
 

2495
00:58:01,490 --> 00:58:08,360
 versus the other am i covering a ton of

2496
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:08,360
 

2497
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:11,540
 ground here ok so this is the last note

2498
00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:11,540
 

2499
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:16,610
 we won a very briefly say before we

2500
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:16,610
 

2501
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:19,460
 break performance monitoring is probably

2502
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:19,460
 

2503
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:21,440
 the place where most of us see

2504
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:21,440
 

2505
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:23,720
 visualization on a day to day basis

2506
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:23,720
 

2507
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:26,840
 right because it's basically a ton of

2508
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:26,840
 

2509
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:29,990
 line charts it's a lot of charts you are

2510
00:58:26,830 --> 00:58:29,990
 

2511
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:32,900
 constantly trying to make sure that your

2512
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:32,900
 

2513
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:36,700
 system is is converging it's doing what

2514
00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:36,700
 

2515
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:39,740
 it's supposed to do and a lot of basics

2516
00:58:36,690 --> 00:58:39,740
 

2517
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:43,490
 work here line charts yay

2518
00:58:39,730 --> 00:58:43,490
 

2519
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:46,490
 go Alli insurance awesome so we're not

2520
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:46,490
 

2521
00:58:43,490 --> 00:58:47,990
 going to dwell a whole lot on monitoring

2522
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,990
 

2523
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:50,000
 dashboards

2524
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:50,000
 

2525
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:52,400
 we're just saying yes visualization

2526
00:58:49,990 --> 00:58:52,400
 

2527
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,920
 super useful continue to use

2528
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:54,920
 

2529
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:57,770
 visualization basics apply here it's all

2530
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:57,770
 

2531
00:58:54,920 --> 00:59:02,000
 good I think we're gonna stop for a

2532
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:02,000
 

2533
00:58:57,770 --> 00:59:08,990
 break here ten minutes and and then we

2534
00:59:01,990 --> 00:59:08,990
 

2535
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:12,200
 come back 10 9 35 okay so we're coming

2536
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:12,200
 

2537
00:59:08,990 --> 00:59:13,640
 back at 9:35 for interpretability you do

2538
00:59:12,190 --> 00:59:13,640
 

2539
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:15,920
 not want to miss that high dimensional

2540
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:15,920
 

2541
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:18,850
 data all sorts of good stuff all right

2542
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:18,850
 

2543
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,850

 okay okay sounds good it sounds good

2588
01:09:25,090 --> 01:09:25,090
 

2589
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:28,660
 and feel free to move the microphone

2590
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:38,160
 

2591
01:09:38,170 --> 01:09:47,440
 okay and we're going to start back with

2592
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:47,440
 

2593
01:09:44,730 --> 01:09:50,530
 what what I think is one of the most

2594
01:09:47,430 --> 01:09:50,530
 

2595
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:52,030
 exciting areas for data visualization in

2596
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,030
 

2597
01:09:50,530 --> 01:09:55,050
 machine learning which is

2598
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:55,050
 

2599
01:09:52,030 --> 01:09:58,600
 interpretability and model inspection

2600
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:58,600
 

2601
01:09:55,050 --> 01:10:01,270
 and I feel like here there are many

2602
01:09:58,590 --> 01:10:01,270
 

2603
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:03,370
 different kinds of approaches and many

2604
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:03,370
 

2605
01:10:01,270 --> 01:10:06,520
 different kinds of questions that people

2606
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:06,520
 

2607
01:10:03,370 --> 01:10:08,050
 are asking when they ask about what are

2608
01:10:06,510 --> 01:10:08,050
 

2609
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:12,580
 their models doing how are they behaving

2610
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:12,580
 

2611
01:10:08,050 --> 01:10:15,730
 and so we're gonna there are different

2612
01:10:12,570 --> 01:10:15,730
 

2613
01:10:12,580 --> 01:10:17,860
 sections to to this part so the first

2614
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:17,860
 

2615
01:10:15,730 --> 01:10:20,560
 thing we're gonna talk about again kind

2616
01:10:17,850 --> 01:10:20,560
 

2617
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:25,000
 of briefly is convolutional neural nets

2618
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:25,000
 

2619
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:27,370
 and we're thinking about the

2620
01:10:24,990 --> 01:10:27,370
 

2621
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:31,300
 interpretation of image classification

2622
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:31,300
 

2623
01:10:27,370 --> 01:10:33,280
 systems here is a petri dish right as we

2624
01:10:31,290 --> 01:10:33,280
 

2625
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:35,800
 all know image classifiers are quite

2626
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:35,800
 

2627
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:37,420
 effective in practice but exactly what

2628
01:10:35,790 --> 01:10:37,420
 

2629
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:39,970
 they're doing and how they're doing it

2630
01:10:37,410 --> 01:10:39,970
 

2631
01:10:37,420 --> 01:10:43,390
 is kind of mysterious and then they have

2632
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:43,390
 

2633
01:10:39,970 --> 01:10:47,620
 failures that add to that mystery right

2634
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:47,620
 

2635
01:10:43,390 --> 01:10:51,720
 for example adversarial examples but

2636
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:51,720
 

2637
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:55,180
 still there are ways to inspect than our

2638
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:55,180
 

2639
01:10:51,720 --> 01:11:00,610
 image classifiers in our human brain so

2640
01:10:55,170 --> 01:11:00,610
 

2641
01:10:55,180 --> 01:11:03,130
 that's good news I guess so and I guess

2642
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:03,130
 

2643
01:11:00,610 --> 01:11:06,310
 another thing is since they are visual

2644
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:06,310
 

2645
01:11:03,130 --> 01:11:07,870
 right they are image classifiers it's

2646
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:07,870
 

2647
01:11:06,310 --> 01:11:11,140
 kind of natural to try to use

2648
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:11,140
 

2649
01:11:07,870 --> 01:11:13,780
 visualization to understand what it is

2650
01:11:11,130 --> 01:11:13,780
 

2651
01:11:11,140 --> 01:11:16,300
 that they're doing so some of the things

2652
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:16,300
 

2653
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:18,550
 that I'm sure a lot of you have seen in

2654
01:11:16,290 --> 01:11:18,550
 

2655
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:22,090
 the literature that these kinds of

2656
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:22,090
 

2657
01:11:18,550 --> 01:11:24,160
 visualization systems try to do it is

2658
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:24,160
 

2659
01:11:22,090 --> 01:11:27,370
 trying to understand what features are

2660
01:11:24,150 --> 01:11:27,370
 

2661
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:30,370
 these networks really using do

2662
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:30,370
 

2663
01:11:27,370 --> 01:11:31,450
 individual units have meaning and this

2664
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:31,450
 

2665
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:33,400
 is really interesting because I feel

2666
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,400
 

2667
01:11:31,450 --> 01:11:35,830
 like there's a class of researchers

2668
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:35,830
 

2669
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:37,690
 where like yes let's inspect individual

2670
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:37,690
 

2671
01:11:35,830 --> 01:11:40,450
 units and other class of researchers was

2672
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:40,450
 

2673
01:11:37,690 --> 01:11:44,170
 like no what are you doing so there are

2674
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:44,170
 

2675
01:11:40,450 --> 01:11:46,030
 different camps what you know what roles

2676
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:46,030
 

2677
01:11:44,170 --> 01:11:48,160
 are played by different layers of the

2678
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:48,160
 

2679
01:11:46,030 --> 01:11:50,920
 network so if you start taking into

2680
01:11:48,150 --> 01:11:50,920
 

2681
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:53,950
 account the architecture of the network

2682
01:11:50,910 --> 01:11:53,950
 

2683
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:57,910
 then how our high-level concepts build

2684
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:57,910
 

2685
01:11:53,950 --> 01:11:59,770
 from lower level concepts okay so one of

2686
01:11:57,900 --> 01:11:59,770
 

2687
01:11:57,910 --> 01:12:02,560
 the first things and one of the most

2688
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:02,560
 

2689
01:11:59,770 --> 01:12:05,110
 ubiquitous things that we see our saline

2690
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:05,110
 

2691
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:08,470
 C maps right and these are those kinds

2692
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:08,470
 

2693
01:12:05,110 --> 01:12:10,360
 of maps where you were trying to

2694
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:10,360
 

2695
01:12:08,470 --> 01:12:12,640
 understand which pixels are the most

2696
01:12:10,350 --> 01:12:12,640
 

2697
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:16,720
 relevant from some for some

2698
01:12:12,630 --> 01:12:16,720
 

2699
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:19,990
 classification and there are a number of

2700
01:12:16,710 --> 01:12:19,990
 

2701
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:22,780
 different methods for getting at saline

2702
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:22,780
 

2703
01:12:19,990 --> 01:12:25,330
 C maps and some of them are looking at

2704
01:12:22,770 --> 01:12:25,330
 

2705
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:27,460
 gradients integrated gradients you you

2706
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:27,460
 

2707
01:12:25,330 --> 01:12:33,060
 can have your pick there are many many

2708
01:12:27,450 --> 01:12:33,060
 

2709
01:12:27,460 --> 01:12:35,770
 different versions of saline C maps so

2710
01:12:33,050 --> 01:12:35,770
 

2711
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:38,890
 the idea with saline C maps is to

2712
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:38,890
 

2713
01:12:35,770 --> 01:12:43,240
 consider the sensitivity of a class to

2714
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:43,240
 

2715
01:12:38,890 --> 01:12:44,350
 each pixel right and there as I was

2716
01:12:43,230 --> 01:12:44,350
 

2717
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:46,720
 saying there are many different ways

2718
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:46,720
 

2719
01:12:44,350 --> 01:12:49,090
 that people have extended that initial

2720
01:12:46,710 --> 01:12:49,090
 

2721
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:49,900
 idea that basic idea there is layer wise

2722
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:49,900
 

2723
01:12:49,090 --> 01:12:53,560
 relevance

2724
01:12:49,890 --> 01:12:53,560
 

2725
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:57,100
 there's integrated gradients guided by

2726
01:12:53,550 --> 01:12:57,100
 

2727
01:12:53,560 --> 01:13:00,180
 crop etc one thing to keep in mind

2728
01:12:57,090 --> 01:13:00,180
 

2729
01:12:57,100 --> 01:13:03,550
 though is that these can be sometimes

2730
01:13:00,170 --> 01:13:03,550
 

2731
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:08,530
 deceiving you know they tend to be

2732
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:08,530
 

2733
01:13:03,550 --> 01:13:12,400
 visually noisy are these guys it's

2734
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:12,400
 

2735
01:13:08,530 --> 01:13:15,970
 sometimes easy to project onto them what

2736
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:15,970
 

2737
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:18,610
 you think you were seeing right oh I see

2738
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:18,610
 

2739
01:13:15,970 --> 01:13:21,460
 the dog face here oh I see the eyes and

2740
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:21,460
 

2741
01:13:18,610 --> 01:13:24,640
 sometimes you do but is it really that

2742
01:13:21,450 --> 01:13:24,640
 

2743
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:27,400
 it's paying attention to eyes and ears

2744
01:13:24,630 --> 01:13:27,400
 

2745
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:30,190
 or is it that it's doing an edge

2746
01:13:27,390 --> 01:13:30,190
 

2747
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:32,320
 detection kind of thing and so there has

2748
01:13:30,180 --> 01:13:32,320
 

2749
01:13:30,190 --> 01:13:34,960
 been work that is trying to tease these

2750
01:13:32,310 --> 01:13:34,960
 

2751
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:38,650
 things apart and it's noisy it's not

2752
01:13:34,950 --> 01:13:38,650
 

2753
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:41,290
 clear that these things are doing what

2754
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:41,290
 

2755
01:13:38,650 --> 01:13:45,630
 we want them to do so just a word of

2756
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:45,630
 

2757
01:13:41,290 --> 01:13:47,650
 caution there other kind of work that I

2758
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:47,650
 

2759
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:49,860
 imagining the community here is very

2760
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:49,860
 

2761
01:13:47,650 --> 01:13:53,230
 familiar with is this notion of

2762
01:13:49,850 --> 01:13:53,230
 

2763
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:55,099
 maximizing neurone response right so

2764
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:55,099
 

2765
01:13:53,230 --> 01:13:58,210
 what are the images that

2766
01:13:55,089 --> 01:13:58,210
 

2767
01:13:55,099 --> 01:14:01,699
 summize the response from us from

2768
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:01,699
 

2769
01:13:58,210 --> 01:14:03,619
 arbitrary neurons and you start to see

2770
01:14:01,689 --> 01:14:03,619
 

2771
01:14:01,699 --> 01:14:07,400
 these interesting kind of building

2772
01:14:03,609 --> 01:14:07,400
 

2773
01:14:03,619 --> 01:14:11,090
 blocks oh you know there are stripe pet

2774
01:14:07,390 --> 01:14:11,090
 

2775
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:14,980
 stripy patterns or there are colors that

2776
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:14,980
 

2777
01:14:11,090 --> 01:14:17,360
 really activate a certain neuron and so

2778
01:14:14,970 --> 01:14:17,360
 

2779
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:18,770
 part of what you're trying to do there

2780
01:14:17,350 --> 01:14:18,770
 

2781
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:20,480
 is to try to understand is there

2782
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:20,480
 

2783
01:14:18,770 --> 01:14:22,159
 anything that we can interpret from

2784
01:14:20,470 --> 01:14:22,159
 

2785
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:25,310
 these from these images that are

2786
01:14:22,149 --> 01:14:25,310
 

2787
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:30,530
 maximally that are maximizing the

2788
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:30,530
 

2789
01:14:25,310 --> 01:14:32,389
 response from given neuron there is also

2790
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,389
 

2791
01:14:30,530 --> 01:14:35,630
 you can do the same kind of thing with

2792
01:14:32,379 --> 01:14:35,630
 

2793
01:14:32,389 --> 01:14:40,010
 relationship to entire classes right so

2794
01:14:35,620 --> 01:14:40,010
 

2795
01:14:35,630 --> 01:14:41,510
 you can say okay the Pelican class what

2796
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,510
 

2797
01:14:40,010 --> 01:14:44,150
 is what are the kinds of things that

2798
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:44,150
 

2799
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:45,949
 activates the most response to that kind

2800
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:45,949
 

2801
01:14:44,150 --> 01:14:49,250
 of class and there is a little bit of

2802
01:14:45,939 --> 01:14:49,250
 

2803
01:14:45,949 --> 01:14:52,280
 art there it's not just otherwise these

2804
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:52,280
 

2805
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:55,310
 these images can kind of look random

2806
01:14:52,270 --> 01:14:55,310
 

2807
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:57,770
 like noise like visual noise so there's

2808
01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:57,770
 

2809
01:14:55,310 --> 01:15:00,040
 a lot of art into making sure that you

2810
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:00,040
 

2811
01:14:57,770 --> 01:15:06,320
 get something that starts to look

2812
01:15:00,030 --> 01:15:06,320
 

2813
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:09,349
 humanly interpretable one of the

2814
01:15:06,310 --> 01:15:09,349
 

2815
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:11,900
 visualizations that I think is super

2816
01:15:09,339 --> 01:15:11,900
 

2817
01:15:09,349 --> 01:15:14,690
 helped has been super helpful and this

2818
01:15:11,890 --> 01:15:14,690
 

2819
01:15:11,900 --> 01:15:20,260
 has been done a while ago is draw net by

2820
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:20,260
 

2821
01:15:14,690 --> 01:15:22,699
 Antonio de Alba and and partners at MIT

2822
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:22,699
 

2823
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:25,400
 this was one of the first visualizations

2824
01:15:22,689 --> 01:15:25,400
 

2825
01:15:22,699 --> 01:15:27,739
 that try to follow this notion of

2826
01:15:25,390 --> 01:15:27,739
 

2827
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:29,929
 activation what is you know what are the

2828
01:15:27,729 --> 01:15:29,929
 

2829
01:15:27,739 --> 01:15:33,230
 building blocks at the very top there

2830
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:33,230
 

2831
01:15:29,929 --> 01:15:35,239
 what are the most basic visual building

2832
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:35,239
 

2833
01:15:33,230 --> 01:15:37,790
 blocks that are that activate neurons

2834
01:15:35,229 --> 01:15:37,790
 

2835
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:40,880
 and then each one of these rows is a

2836
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:40,880
 

2837
01:15:37,790 --> 01:15:44,440
 layer and each one of these dots is a

2838
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:44,440
 

2839
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:48,170
 different neuron in that layer and so

2840
01:15:44,430 --> 01:15:48,170
 

2841
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:53,119
 you can start you can click on different

2842
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:53,119
 

2843
01:15:48,170 --> 01:15:57,460
 neurons and see actually let me see let

2844
01:15:53,109 --> 01:15:57,460
 

2845
01:15:53,119 --> 01:15:57,460
 me see if I can give a very quick

2846
01:15:58,180 --> 01:15:58,180
 

2847
01:15:58,190 --> 01:16:10,680
 demo of this if it takes too long I will

2848
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:10,680
 

2849
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:14,370
 move on I'll move on but one of the

2850
01:16:10,670 --> 01:16:14,370
 

2851
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:16,920
 things that I think is really nice about

2852
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:16,920
 

2853
01:16:14,370 --> 01:16:20,070
 this visualization is that I've seen

2854
01:16:16,910 --> 01:16:20,070
 

2855
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:21,739
 this being used to tell to explain to

2856
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:21,739
 

2857
01:16:20,070 --> 01:16:25,739
 people outside of the machine learning

2858
01:16:21,729 --> 01:16:25,739
 

2859
01:16:21,739 --> 01:16:28,530
 community how neural networks how how

2860
01:16:25,729 --> 01:16:28,530
 

2861
01:16:25,739 --> 01:16:31,110
 these systems work and how they kind of

2862
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:31,110
 

2863
01:16:28,530 --> 01:16:34,100
 pieced together from building blocks all

2864
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:34,100
 

2865
01:16:31,110 --> 01:16:38,100
 the way into complicated scenes or

2866
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:38,100
 

2867
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:41,450
 entire concepts like a flower a dog and

2868
01:16:38,090 --> 01:16:41,450
 

2869
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:44,250
 and so forth and so there is a lot of

2870
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:44,250
 

2871
01:16:41,450 --> 01:16:48,360
 power in a visualization like this that

2872
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:48,360
 

2873
01:16:44,250 --> 01:16:51,120
 tries to connect these concepts and then

2874
01:16:48,350 --> 01:16:51,120
 

2875
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:52,410
 obviously we have things like deep dream

2876
01:16:51,110 --> 01:16:52,410
 

2877
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:56,660
 in a sense this is like the culmination

2878
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:56,660
 

2879
01:16:52,410 --> 01:17:04,620
 of trying to activate the heck out of

2880
01:16:56,650 --> 01:17:04,620
 

2881
01:16:56,660 --> 01:17:07,950
 these neurons and then we come to places

2882
01:17:04,610 --> 01:17:07,950
 

2883
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:09,540
 where like this this paper here called

2884
01:17:07,940 --> 01:17:09,540
 

2885
01:17:07,950 --> 01:17:14,130
 the building blocks of interpretability

2886
01:17:09,530 --> 01:17:14,130
 

2887
01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:16,170
 and this was a paper on distill that try

2888
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:16,170
 

2889
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:19,830
 to bring together a lot of these

2890
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:19,830
 

2891
01:17:16,170 --> 01:17:21,540
 different approaches and say oh okay if

2892
01:17:19,820 --> 01:17:21,540
 

2893
01:17:19,830 --> 01:17:25,860
 we start looking at these different

2894
01:17:21,530 --> 01:17:25,860
 

2895
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:27,690
 activations notice here just referring

2896
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:27,690
 

2897
01:17:25,860 --> 01:17:30,630
 back to some of the things we were

2898
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:30,630
 

2899
01:17:27,690 --> 01:17:34,500
 talking about before they are making use

2900
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:34,500
 

2901
01:17:30,630 --> 01:17:36,900
 of small multiples they are labeling a

2902
01:17:34,490 --> 01:17:36,900
 

2903
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:39,360
 lot of a lot of what they're doing a lot

2904
01:17:36,890 --> 01:17:39,360
 

2905
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:42,120
 of this is very interactive so they

2906
01:17:39,350 --> 01:17:42,120
 

2907
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:43,710
 really use to the fold this notion of

2908
01:17:42,110 --> 01:17:43,710
 

2909
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:47,430
 I'm going to interact with this very

2910
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:47,430
 

2911
01:17:43,710 --> 01:17:51,510
 complicated space of data to try to

2912
01:17:47,420 --> 01:17:51,510
 

2913
01:17:47,430 --> 01:17:53,130
 understand how are these systems working

2914
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,130
 

2915
01:17:51,510 --> 01:17:57,960
 and they have a whole system that lays

2916
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:57,960
 

2917
01:17:53,130 --> 01:18:00,900
 out kind of in their minds what the

2918
01:17:57,950 --> 01:18:00,900
 

2919
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:02,760
 interpretability landscape is like and

2920
01:18:00,890 --> 01:18:02,760
 

2921
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:03,320
 what kinds of insights you might want to

2922
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:03,320
 

2923
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:07,000
 get

2924
01:18:03,310 --> 01:18:07,000
 

2925
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:12,770
 by doing different kinds of approaches

2926
01:18:06,990 --> 01:18:12,770
 

2927
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:15,140
 here's another work from MIT where they

2928
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:15,140
 

2929
01:18:12,770 --> 01:18:17,390
 are going from visualizations to

2930
01:18:15,130 --> 01:18:17,390
 

2931
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:22,310
 interpretation so they are taking this

2932
01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:22,310
 

2933
01:18:17,390 --> 01:18:24,650
 idea of you have a scene a complex scene

2934
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:24,650
 

2935
01:18:22,310 --> 01:18:28,420
 that has been human labeled and and

2936
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:28,420
 

2937
01:18:24,650 --> 01:18:33,080
 there's more than one concept her image

2938
01:18:28,410 --> 01:18:33,080
 

2939
01:18:28,420 --> 01:18:37,490
 and then you visualize a certain you you

2940
01:18:33,070 --> 01:18:37,490
 

2941
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:39,170
 you look at the top activated images for

2942
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:39,170
 

2943
01:18:37,490 --> 01:18:43,790
 some unit okay

2944
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:43,790
 

2945
01:18:39,170 --> 01:18:46,460
 so this top row here happens to be faces

2946
01:18:43,780 --> 01:18:46,460
 

2947
01:18:43,790 --> 01:18:48,860
 and then you try to look at what is the

2948
01:18:46,450 --> 01:18:48,860
 

2949
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:52,160
 concept that it most closely matches to

2950
01:18:48,850 --> 01:18:52,160
 

2951
01:18:48,860 --> 01:18:56,510
 and in this case its head so it starts

2952
01:18:52,150 --> 01:18:56,510
 

2953
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:58,850
 to bridge that gap between activations

2954
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:58,850
 

2955
01:18:56,510 --> 01:19:02,660
 visual activations and actual concepts

2956
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:02,660
 

2957
01:18:58,850 --> 01:19:04,850
 that we can interpret and then we can

2958
01:19:02,650 --> 01:19:04,850
 

2959
01:19:02,660 --> 01:19:07,850
 understand and so this seems like an

2960
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:07,850
 

2961
01:19:04,850 --> 01:19:09,650
 interesting way of bridging not only

2962
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,650
 

2963
01:19:07,850 --> 01:19:11,930
 what's happening visually and what's

2964
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:11,930
 

2965
01:19:09,650 --> 01:19:14,090
 happening with the pixels but getting

2966
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:14,090
 

2967
01:19:11,930 --> 01:19:21,800
 into more of the semantics and the

2968
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:21,800
 

2969
01:19:14,090 --> 01:19:24,190
 conceptual sense okay so our n ends here

2970
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:24,190
 

2971
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:27,290
 one of the one of the works that we

2972
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:27,290
 

2973
01:19:24,190 --> 01:19:29,810
 admire a lot is Carpathia's work that

2974
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:29,810
 

2975
01:19:27,290 --> 01:19:32,840
 again it's kind of it's a it's kind of

2976
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:32,840
 

2977
01:19:29,810 --> 01:19:36,230
 old at this point but we thought did an

2978
01:19:32,830 --> 01:19:36,230
 

2979
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:38,720
 amazing job of looking at visualizing

2980
01:19:36,220 --> 01:19:38,720
 

2981
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:41,060
 text sequences and again trying to

2982
01:19:38,710 --> 01:19:41,060
 

2983
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:43,400
 understand oh if you activate different

2984
01:19:41,050 --> 01:19:43,400
 

2985
01:19:41,060 --> 01:19:47,030
 cells what kinds of can you interpret

2986
01:19:43,390 --> 01:19:47,030
 

2987
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:49,610
 them and grant it most of the cells you

2988
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:49,610
 

2989
01:19:47,030 --> 01:19:52,220
 can't interpret they don't give you any

2990
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:52,220
 

2991
01:19:49,610 --> 01:19:55,220
 pattern that kind of makes sense but

2992
01:19:52,210 --> 01:19:55,220
 

2993
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:58,220
 some of them I think it was around 5% of

2994
01:19:55,210 --> 01:19:58,220
 

2995
01:19:55,220 --> 01:20:02,360
 them did so here's a couple of examples

2996
01:19:58,210 --> 01:20:02,360
 

2997
01:19:58,220 --> 01:20:05,540
 of those the top one this one here that

2998
01:20:02,350 --> 01:20:05,540
 

2999
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:07,940
 looks like a gradient is a cell that's

3000
01:20:05,530 --> 01:20:07,940
 

3001
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:10,309
 sensitive to position in line in the

3002
01:20:07,930 --> 01:20:10,309
 

3003
01:20:07,940 --> 01:20:13,489
 line of text okay

3004
01:20:10,299 --> 01:20:13,489
 

3005
01:20:10,309 --> 01:20:17,150
 and then the bottom one is a cell that

3006
01:20:13,479 --> 01:20:17,150
 

3007
01:20:13,489 --> 01:20:20,300
 turns on inside quotes so you open the

3008
01:20:17,140 --> 01:20:20,300
 

3009
01:20:17,150 --> 01:20:22,340
 quotes here and it turns red and then

3010
01:20:20,290 --> 01:20:22,340
 

3011
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:25,489
 you close the quotes and it goes back

3012
01:20:22,330 --> 01:20:25,489
 

3013
01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:27,889
 right so it's very very sensitive to to

3014
01:20:25,479 --> 01:20:27,889
 

3015
01:20:25,489 --> 01:20:30,710
 these concepts I'm gonna interject a

3016
01:20:27,879 --> 01:20:30,710
 

3017
01:20:27,889 --> 01:20:31,940
 little visualization note here is to

3018
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:31,940
 

3019
01:20:30,710 --> 01:20:33,530
 look at what's going on in this like

3020
01:20:31,930 --> 01:20:33,530
 

3021
01:20:31,940 --> 01:20:35,300
 this is a very beautiful simple

3022
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:35,300
 

3023
01:20:33,530 --> 01:20:38,420
 visualization but first of all the color

3024
01:20:35,290 --> 01:20:38,420
 

3025
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:40,699
 scale is very friendly to people who are

3026
01:20:38,410 --> 01:20:40,699
 

3027
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:43,489
 red-green color blind the other thing is

3028
01:20:40,689 --> 01:20:43,489
 

3029
01:20:40,699 --> 01:20:45,710
 looking the fact that he used color here

3030
01:20:43,479 --> 01:20:45,710
 

3031
01:20:43,489 --> 01:20:47,840
 is really nice because it layers right

3032
01:20:45,700 --> 01:20:47,840
 

3033
01:20:45,710 --> 01:20:49,190
 on top of the data and so it's a good

3034
01:20:47,830 --> 01:20:49,190
 

3035
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:50,809
 example of even though color is

3036
01:20:49,180 --> 01:20:50,809
 

3037
01:20:49,190 --> 01:20:53,059
 typically not considered the right way

3038
01:20:50,799 --> 01:20:53,059
 

3039
01:20:50,809 --> 01:20:55,099
 to show quantitative data and you say a

3040
01:20:53,049 --> 01:20:55,099
 

3041
01:20:53,059 --> 01:20:55,550
 graph or something this is actually

3042
01:20:55,089 --> 01:20:55,550
 

3043
01:20:55,099 --> 01:20:57,980
 really good

3044
01:20:55,540 --> 01:20:57,980
 

3045
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:59,480
 it's and it's a good example of making

3046
01:20:57,970 --> 01:20:59,480
 

3047
01:20:57,980 --> 01:21:04,520
 the right trade-off to make the

3048
01:20:59,470 --> 01:21:04,520
 

3049
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:05,929
 visualization work yeah and you brought

3050
01:21:04,510 --> 01:21:05,929
 

3051
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:09,079
 up a really good point that I want to

3052
01:21:05,919 --> 01:21:09,079
 

3053
01:21:05,929 --> 01:21:11,719
 emphasize is whenever you're visualizing

3054
01:21:09,069 --> 01:21:11,719
 

3055
01:21:09,079 --> 01:21:14,270
 something if you can always go back to

3056
01:21:11,709 --> 01:21:14,270
 

3057
01:21:11,719 --> 01:21:16,909
 your raw data and show that to the user

3058
01:21:14,260 --> 01:21:16,909
 

3059
01:21:14,270 --> 01:21:19,550
 in this case the raw data is the text

3060
01:21:16,899 --> 01:21:19,550
 

3061
01:21:16,909 --> 01:21:21,079
 the better your visualization is going

3062
01:21:19,540 --> 01:21:21,079
 

3063
01:21:19,550 --> 01:21:24,530
 to be because you're gonna bridge that

3064
01:21:21,069 --> 01:21:24,530
 

3065
01:21:21,079 --> 01:21:26,860
 gap between like some analytical framing

3066
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:26,860
 

3067
01:21:24,530 --> 01:21:30,320
 or a visual encoding you're doing and

3068
01:21:26,850 --> 01:21:30,320
 

3069
01:21:26,860 --> 01:21:32,570
 the messiness of the raw and exactly

3070
01:21:30,310 --> 01:21:32,570
 

3071
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:35,989
 what it is you're encoding so take

3072
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:35,989
 

3073
01:21:32,570 --> 01:21:39,099
 advantage of that as much as you can and

3074
01:21:35,979 --> 01:21:39,099
 

3075
01:21:35,989 --> 01:21:43,309
 a final exam here example here of a cell

3076
01:21:39,089 --> 01:21:43,309
 

3077
01:21:39,099 --> 01:21:45,739
 that activates inside if statements so

3078
01:21:43,299 --> 01:21:45,739
 

3079
01:21:43,309 --> 01:21:50,960
 it really cares about if statements and

3080
01:21:45,729 --> 01:21:50,960
 

3081
01:21:45,739 --> 01:21:53,980
 then it flips back this is another

3082
01:21:50,950 --> 01:21:53,980
 

3083
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:57,590
 example this is a much more recent

3084
01:21:53,970 --> 01:21:57,590
 

3085
01:21:53,980 --> 01:22:02,000
 example of visualizing RNN so this is a

3086
01:21:57,580 --> 01:22:02,000
 

3087
01:21:57,590 --> 01:22:05,690
 seek to seek this and it's by Hendricks

3088
01:22:01,990 --> 01:22:05,690
 

3089
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:07,940
 TRO belt and here what he was looking at

3090
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:07,940
 

3091
01:22:05,690 --> 01:22:11,119
 he was really interested in building a

3092
01:22:07,930 --> 01:22:11,119
 

3093
01:22:07,940 --> 01:22:15,860
 visual tool that allowed researchers to

3094
01:22:11,109 --> 01:22:15,860
 

3095
01:22:11,119 --> 01:22:17,239
 debug a translation system okay so what

3096
01:22:15,850 --> 01:22:17,239
 

3097
01:22:15,860 --> 01:22:19,619
 he's he has a ton of different

3098
01:22:17,229 --> 01:22:19,619
 

3099
01:22:17,239 --> 01:22:21,360
 visualizations here put together

3100
01:22:19,609 --> 01:22:21,360
 

3101
01:22:19,619 --> 01:22:23,789
 and they are all interacting with each

3102
01:22:21,350 --> 01:22:23,789
 

3103
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:27,809
 other and it starts here at the top

3104
01:22:23,779 --> 01:22:27,809
 

3105
01:22:23,789 --> 01:22:31,199
 where he enters a sentence in German and

3106
01:22:27,799 --> 01:22:31,199
 

3107
01:22:27,809 --> 01:22:34,349
 so this is what the encoder see hears in

3108
01:22:31,189 --> 01:22:34,349
 

3109
01:22:31,199 --> 01:22:38,209
 German the decoder is looking at English

3110
01:22:34,339 --> 01:22:38,209
 

3111
01:22:34,349 --> 01:22:41,369
 but it's giving you for each one of its

3112
01:22:38,199 --> 01:22:41,369
 

3113
01:22:38,209 --> 01:22:44,159
 words in that sequence it's giving you a

3114
01:22:41,359 --> 01:22:44,159
 

3115
01:22:41,369 --> 01:22:48,749
 notion of all the other words he didn't

3116
01:22:44,149 --> 01:22:48,749
 

3117
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:50,789
 choose and Hendrik is overlaying a bar

3118
01:22:48,739 --> 01:22:50,789
 

3119
01:22:48,749 --> 01:22:53,099
 chart to give you a sense of the

3120
01:22:50,779 --> 01:22:53,099
 

3121
01:22:50,789 --> 01:22:56,550
 probability so you can see that for some

3122
01:22:53,089 --> 01:22:56,550
 

3123
01:22:53,099 --> 01:22:58,379
 of these choices here the choice was

3124
01:22:56,540 --> 01:22:58,379
 

3125
01:22:56,550 --> 01:23:02,939
 very close the probability was very

3126
01:22:58,369 --> 01:23:02,939
 

3127
01:22:58,379 --> 01:23:05,309
 close so this starts to not only remind

3128
01:23:02,929 --> 01:23:05,309
 

3129
01:23:02,939 --> 01:23:07,409
 you of the output of the system but it

3130
01:23:05,299 --> 01:23:07,409
 

3131
01:23:05,309 --> 01:23:09,059
 goes one layer down and starts to show

3132
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:09,059
 

3133
01:23:07,409 --> 01:23:10,979
 you yeah but I was kind of confused

3134
01:23:09,049 --> 01:23:10,979
 

3135
01:23:09,059 --> 01:23:12,869
 about you know these two words or I

3136
01:23:10,969 --> 01:23:12,869
 

3137
01:23:10,979 --> 01:23:16,050
 could have chosen the other one or no I

3138
01:23:12,859 --> 01:23:16,050
 

3139
01:23:12,869 --> 01:23:20,099
 was very very certain of my top choice

3140
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:20,099
 

3141
01:23:16,050 --> 01:23:22,260
 there it also it also shows you this

3142
01:23:20,089 --> 01:23:22,260
 

3143
01:23:20,099 --> 01:23:25,110
 tree structure for all the different

3144
01:23:22,250 --> 01:23:25,110
 

3145
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:27,959
 paths it could have followed in this

3146
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:27,959
 

3147
01:23:25,110 --> 01:23:31,289
 translation and it highlights for you in

3148
01:23:27,949 --> 01:23:31,289
 

3149
01:23:27,959 --> 01:23:35,099
 in a thicker way here the path it shows

3150
01:23:31,279 --> 01:23:35,099
 

3151
01:23:31,289 --> 01:23:37,439
 again trying to give you a sense of all

3152
01:23:35,089 --> 01:23:37,439
 

3153
01:23:35,099 --> 01:23:41,399
 the different choices it was considering

3154
01:23:37,429 --> 01:23:41,399
 

3155
01:23:37,439 --> 01:23:46,289
 and then here it takes each one of these

3156
01:23:41,389 --> 01:23:46,289
 

3157
01:23:41,399 --> 01:23:49,559
 words in in the target language and it

3158
01:23:46,279 --> 01:23:49,559
 

3159
01:23:46,289 --> 01:23:52,229
 looks at the embedding spaces but not

3160
01:23:49,549 --> 01:23:52,229
 

3161
01:23:49,559 --> 01:23:54,869
 only that it also gives you a notion of

3162
01:23:52,219 --> 01:23:54,869
 

3163
01:23:52,229 --> 01:23:56,879
 the nearest neighbors for each one of

3164
01:23:54,859 --> 01:23:56,879
 

3165
01:23:54,869 --> 01:24:00,419
 these words that it that it was looking

3166
01:23:56,869 --> 01:24:00,419
 

3167
01:23:56,879 --> 01:24:02,629
 at so again giving you the target but

3168
01:24:00,409 --> 01:24:02,629
 

3169
01:24:00,419 --> 01:24:05,249
 always giving you the context and

3170
01:24:02,619 --> 01:24:05,249
 

3171
01:24:02,629 --> 01:24:07,919
 allowing you to kind of try to

3172
01:24:05,239 --> 01:24:07,919
 

3173
01:24:05,249 --> 01:24:09,989
 understand oh do I agree with what it's

3174
01:24:07,909 --> 01:24:09,989
 

3175
01:24:07,919 --> 01:24:13,079
 doing do I think there is a problem how

3176
01:24:09,979 --> 01:24:13,079
 

3177
01:24:09,989 --> 01:24:15,869
 do i do bug this thing okay I believe

3178
01:24:13,069 --> 01:24:15,869
 

3179
01:24:13,079 --> 01:24:19,610
 this is open source right I think it's

3180
01:24:15,859 --> 01:24:19,610
 

3181
01:24:15,869 --> 01:24:22,490
 open source and then finally

3182
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:22,490
 

3183
01:24:19,610 --> 01:24:27,950
 this is one visualization that was

3184
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:27,950
 

3185
01:24:22,490 --> 01:24:28,970
 looking at games and very complicated

3186
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:28,970
 

3187
01:24:27,950 --> 01:24:32,690
 you can see there's a ton of

3188
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:32,690
 

3189
01:24:28,970 --> 01:24:35,660
 visualizations here right and again it

3190
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:35,660
 

3191
01:24:32,690 --> 01:24:38,000
 was one of these connected views where

3192
01:24:35,650 --> 01:24:38,000
 

3193
01:24:35,660 --> 01:24:41,030
 you would highlight one breath and you

3194
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:41,030
 

3195
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:42,830
 would the others would respond to

3196
01:24:41,020 --> 01:24:42,830
 

3197
01:24:41,030 --> 01:24:46,820
 whatever it is that you were you were

3198
01:24:42,820 --> 01:24:46,820
 

3199
01:24:42,830 --> 01:24:48,500
 looking at and one of the things we

3200
01:24:46,810 --> 01:24:48,500
 

3201
01:24:46,820 --> 01:24:51,860
 wanted to call attention to if you are

3202
01:24:48,490 --> 01:24:51,860
 

3203
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:56,870
 interested in visualization is this vast

3204
01:24:51,850 --> 01:24:56,870
 

3205
01:24:51,860 --> 01:24:58,700
 vest is a conference visual analytics

3206
01:24:56,860 --> 01:24:58,700
 

3207
01:24:56,870 --> 01:25:01,970
 conference and they are starting to do a

3208
01:24:58,690 --> 01:25:01,970
 

3209
01:24:58,700 --> 01:25:03,500
 lot of work on visualizations for

3210
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:03,500
 

3211
01:25:01,970 --> 01:25:10,370
 machine learning and so this work was

3212
01:25:03,490 --> 01:25:10,370
 

3213
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:12,290
 was published there cool okay so let's

3214
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:12,290
 

3215
01:25:10,370 --> 01:25:15,590
 talk a little bit about high dimensional

3216
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:15,590
 

3217
01:25:12,290 --> 01:25:18,200
 data so this is a sort of you know

3218
01:25:15,580 --> 01:25:18,200
 

3219
01:25:15,590 --> 01:25:20,330
 critical part of machine learning that

3220
01:25:18,190 --> 01:25:20,330
 

3221
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:22,610
 in a sense it's the lingua franca this

3222
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:22,610
 

3223
01:25:20,330 --> 01:25:24,800
 is how you know so many things in a

3224
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:24,800
 

3225
01:25:22,610 --> 01:25:27,890
 complex model can be reduced to a vector

3226
01:25:24,790 --> 01:25:27,890
 

3227
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:29,660
 in high dimensional space and so the the

3228
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:29,660
 

3229
01:25:27,890 --> 01:25:31,870
 question about visualizing this this

3230
01:25:29,650 --> 01:25:31,870
 

3231
01:25:29,660 --> 01:25:34,370
 kind of data it becomes critical

3232
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:34,370
 

3233
01:25:31,870 --> 01:25:36,260
 unfortunately it's really tough and it's

3234
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:36,260
 

3235
01:25:34,370 --> 01:25:38,240
 tough for the unfortunate reason that

3236
01:25:36,250 --> 01:25:38,240
 

3237
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:40,790
 it's impossible like you just can't do

3238
01:25:38,230 --> 01:25:40,790
 

3239
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:43,760
 it right you know and the familiar

3240
01:25:40,780 --> 01:25:43,760
 

3241
01:25:40,790 --> 01:25:45,590
 analogy is with a map that if we try to

3242
01:25:43,750 --> 01:25:45,590
 

3243
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:47,690
 project the globe onto two dimensions

3244
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:47,690
 

3245
01:25:45,590 --> 01:25:49,970
 there are lots of different ways we can

3246
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:49,970
 

3247
01:25:47,690 --> 01:25:52,370
 do it but it's always just inevitably

3248
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:52,370
 

3249
01:25:49,970 --> 01:25:55,190
 from math going to distort some

3250
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:55,190
 

3251
01:25:52,370 --> 01:25:58,190
 distances and I like this image from

3252
01:25:55,180 --> 01:25:58,190
 

3253
01:25:55,190 --> 01:26:01,880
 Mike Bostock of many many different

3254
01:25:58,180 --> 01:26:01,880
 

3255
01:25:58,190 --> 01:26:04,370
 projections at once so what do we do we

3256
01:26:01,870 --> 01:26:04,370
 

3257
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:06,560
 basically again visualization is always

3258
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:06,560
 

3259
01:26:04,370 --> 01:26:08,690
 an art of trade-offs and they're a bunch

3260
01:26:06,550 --> 01:26:08,690
 

3261
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:10,910
 of approaches that we can use to try to

3262
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:10,910
 

3263
01:26:08,690 --> 01:26:13,870
 make these trade-offs so they fall into

3264
01:26:10,900 --> 01:26:13,870
 

3265
01:26:10,910 --> 01:26:15,710
 two main categories one is on linear

3266
01:26:13,860 --> 01:26:15,710
 

3267
01:26:13,870 --> 01:26:17,360
 approaches where we're trying to find a

3268
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:17,360
 

3269
01:26:15,710 --> 01:26:18,860
 good linear projection principal

3270
01:26:17,350 --> 01:26:18,860
 

3271
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:19,430
 component analysis is kind of a

3272
01:26:18,850 --> 01:26:19,430
 

3273
01:26:18,860 --> 01:26:21,860
 workhorse

3274
01:26:19,420 --> 01:26:21,860
 

3275
01:26:19,430 --> 01:26:24,470
 oh I realized I don't have authorship on

3276
01:26:21,850 --> 01:26:24,470
 

3277
01:26:21,860 --> 01:26:27,650
 this there's a paper from 2003 in focus

3278
01:26:24,460 --> 01:26:27,650
 

3279
01:26:24,470 --> 01:26:29,120
 which I feel like is not seen enough but

3280
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:29,120
 

3281
01:26:27,650 --> 01:26:32,060
 yahuda Corin is

3282
01:26:29,110 --> 01:26:32,060
 

3283
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:33,680
 authorites not present this I in which

3284
01:26:32,050 --> 01:26:33,680
 

3285
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:35,060
 they do this brilliant thing which I

3286
01:26:33,670 --> 01:26:35,060
 

3287
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:37,730
 don't think is done enough where if you

3288
01:26:35,050 --> 01:26:37,730
 

3289
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:39,890
 wanted to if you have labeled data you

3290
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:39,890
 

3291
01:26:37,730 --> 01:26:41,810
 can simultaneously you can find an

3292
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:41,810
 

3293
01:26:39,890 --> 01:26:43,340
 optimal linear projection to separate

3294
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:43,340
 

3295
01:26:41,810 --> 01:26:46,040
 the labels from each other and its

3296
01:26:43,330 --> 01:26:46,040
 

3297
01:26:43,340 --> 01:26:48,500
 really effective so that's another thing

3298
01:26:46,030 --> 01:26:48,500
 

3299
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:51,290
 to consider there's also a bunch of

3300
01:26:48,490 --> 01:26:51,290
 

3301
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:53,630
 nonlinear methods many many of them and

3302
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:53,630
 

3303
01:26:51,290 --> 01:26:54,980
 you can sort of think overall to like

3304
01:26:53,620 --> 01:26:54,980
 

3305
01:26:53,630 --> 01:26:57,230
 what is the goal of each of these

3306
01:26:54,970 --> 01:26:57,230
 

3307
01:26:54,980 --> 01:27:00,020
 methods you know PCA is just trying to

3308
01:26:57,220 --> 01:27:00,020
 

3309
01:26:57,230 --> 01:27:01,520
 capture as much variation this idea of

3310
01:27:00,010 --> 01:27:01,520
 

3311
01:27:00,020 --> 01:27:03,530
 visualization label data it doesn't have

3312
01:27:01,510 --> 01:27:03,530
 

3313
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:05,990
 a catchy name you've sort of matched the

3314
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:05,990
 

3315
01:27:03,530 --> 01:27:07,700
 clusters with a projection and the

3316
01:27:05,980 --> 01:27:07,700
 

3317
01:27:05,990 --> 01:27:10,430
 nonlinear methods generally have some

3318
01:27:07,690 --> 01:27:10,430
 

3319
01:27:07,700 --> 01:27:15,020
 metric of distortion that they use and

3320
01:27:10,420 --> 01:27:15,020
 

3321
01:27:10,430 --> 01:27:16,820
 try to minimize that distortion so let's

3322
01:27:15,010 --> 01:27:16,820
 

3323
01:27:15,020 --> 01:27:18,560
 take a look at some of these in practice

3324
01:27:16,810 --> 01:27:18,560
 

3325
01:27:16,820 --> 01:27:20,570
 and then I want to talk a little bit

3326
01:27:18,550 --> 01:27:20,570
 

3327
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:22,810
 about sort of the theory and how to read

3328
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:22,810
 

3329
01:27:20,570 --> 01:27:22,810
 these

3330
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:29,160
 

3331
01:27:29,170 --> 01:27:33,430
 okay so what you're seeing here is a

3332
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:33,430
 

3333
01:27:31,390 --> 01:27:35,410
 tool called the embedding projector that

3334
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:35,410
 

3335
01:27:33,430 --> 01:27:38,890
 our group created it's out in the world

3336
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:38,890
 

3337
01:27:35,410 --> 01:27:40,810
 open source and we'll use our high

3338
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:40,810
 

3339
01:27:38,890 --> 01:27:44,440
 dimensional data set em NIST largely

3340
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:44,440
 

3341
01:27:40,810 --> 01:27:45,790
 because it's familiar and this is

3342
01:27:44,430 --> 01:27:45,790
 

3343
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:47,650
 showing what happens when you do a

3344
01:27:45,780 --> 01:27:47,650
 

3345
01:27:45,790 --> 01:27:50,350
 principal component analysis view a

3346
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:50,350
 

3347
01:27:47,650 --> 01:27:52,270
 feminist and we can do this makes a

3348
01:27:50,340 --> 01:27:52,270
 

3349
01:27:50,350 --> 01:27:55,630
 little bit more readable

3350
01:27:52,260 --> 01:27:55,630
 

3351
01:27:52,270 --> 01:27:58,630
 by adding a color to this so now that

3352
01:27:55,620 --> 01:27:58,630
 

3353
01:27:55,630 --> 01:28:00,850
 every digit gets its own color again

3354
01:27:58,620 --> 01:28:00,850
 

3355
01:27:58,630 --> 01:28:03,430
 thinking about color scales we're

3356
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:03,430
 

3357
01:28:00,850 --> 01:28:06,310
 choosing what on the color Brewer tool

3358
01:28:03,420 --> 01:28:06,310
 

3359
01:28:03,430 --> 01:28:07,780
 would think of as not sequential or not

3360
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:07,780
 

3361
01:28:06,310 --> 01:28:09,220
 diverging but one of these ones is

3362
01:28:07,770 --> 01:28:09,220
 

3363
01:28:07,780 --> 01:28:11,890
 designed to show different categories

3364
01:28:09,210 --> 01:28:11,890
 

3365
01:28:09,220 --> 01:28:14,860
 and when we do that we can actually see

3366
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:14,860
 

3367
01:28:11,890 --> 01:28:16,540
 that PCA does not do a terrible job of

3368
01:28:14,850 --> 01:28:16,540
 

3369
01:28:14,860 --> 01:28:18,730
 separating these things like you can

3370
01:28:16,530 --> 01:28:18,730
 

3371
01:28:16,540 --> 01:28:20,260
 sort of see the ones are all in their

3372
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:20,260
 

3373
01:28:18,730 --> 01:28:21,940
 area but then there's a bunch of things

3374
01:28:20,250 --> 01:28:21,940
 

3375
01:28:20,260 --> 01:28:23,620
 that sort of are are getting mixed up

3376
01:28:21,930 --> 01:28:23,620
 

3377
01:28:21,940 --> 01:28:26,380
 here but so it's maybe a little better

3378
01:28:23,610 --> 01:28:26,380
 

3379
01:28:23,620 --> 01:28:27,910
 than you think however we can still do

3380
01:28:26,370 --> 01:28:27,910
 

3381
01:28:26,380 --> 01:28:36,490
 better than this if we wanted to look

3382
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:36,490
 

3383
01:28:27,910 --> 01:28:40,750
 for clusters in particular we can look

3384
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:40,750
 

3385
01:28:36,490 --> 01:28:42,640
 at T Snee a nonlinear method and when we

3386
01:28:40,740 --> 01:28:42,640
 

3387
01:28:40,750 --> 01:28:45,640
 do that we suddenly get a bunch of

3388
01:28:42,630 --> 01:28:45,640
 

3389
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:47,650
 fairly well separated clusters and we

3390
01:28:45,630 --> 01:28:47,650
 

3391
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:49,860
 even can start to see things that look

3392
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:49,860
 

3393
01:28:47,650 --> 01:28:53,020
 like they might be sort of significant

3394
01:28:49,850 --> 01:28:53,020
 

3395
01:28:49,860 --> 01:28:55,630
 you know one thing is if we look at for

3396
01:28:53,010 --> 01:28:55,630
 

3397
01:28:53,020 --> 01:28:57,370
 example this cluster of ones you can

3398
01:28:55,620 --> 01:28:57,370
 

3399
01:28:55,630 --> 01:28:59,350
 sort of see there's a slant going on

3400
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:59,350
 

3401
01:28:57,370 --> 01:29:01,090
 where on the left here they're slanting

3402
01:28:59,340 --> 01:29:01,090
 

3403
01:28:59,350 --> 01:29:03,130
 to the right over on this side they're

3404
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:03,130
 

3405
01:29:01,090 --> 01:29:04,960
 slanting to the left and it feels like

3406
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:04,960
 

3407
01:29:03,130 --> 01:29:09,360
 it's starting to capture some sort of

3408
01:29:04,950 --> 01:29:09,360
 

3409
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:09,360
 useful information okay

3410
01:29:12,739 --> 01:29:12,739
 

3411
01:29:12,749 --> 01:29:19,280
 let's go back here

3412
01:29:16,299 --> 01:29:19,280
 

3413
01:29:16,309 --> 01:29:20,809
 okay the trouble is that as I said you

3414
01:29:19,270 --> 01:29:20,809
 

3415
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:23,570
 know you can't really get a faithful

3416
01:29:20,799 --> 01:29:23,570
 

3417
01:29:20,809 --> 01:29:25,460
 projection down and so there's a lot of

3418
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:25,460
 

3419
01:29:23,570 --> 01:29:29,300
 trickiness and let's analyze that

3420
01:29:25,450 --> 01:29:29,300
 

3421
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:32,030
 trickiness so let's start with TCE this

3422
01:29:29,290 --> 01:29:32,030
 

3423
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:35,389
 is our main example so this is a truly

3424
01:29:32,020 --> 01:29:35,389
 

3425
01:29:32,030 --> 01:29:37,550
 beautiful visualization method and one

3426
01:29:35,379 --> 01:29:37,550
 

3427
01:29:35,389 --> 01:29:39,770
 of the things that makes it work but

3428
01:29:37,540 --> 01:29:39,770
 

3429
01:29:37,550 --> 01:29:41,960
 also makes it hard to interpret is it

3430
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:41,960
 

3431
01:29:39,770 --> 01:29:45,800
 has this adaptive sense of distance and

3432
01:29:41,950 --> 01:29:45,800
 

3433
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:48,050
 this is designed to sort of provide a

3434
01:29:45,790 --> 01:29:48,050
 

3435
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:49,520
 good translation between how distances

3436
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:49,520
 

3437
01:29:48,050 --> 01:29:51,980
 work in high dimensional space and low

3438
01:29:49,510 --> 01:29:51,980
 

3439
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:53,840
 dimensional space and also you know it

3440
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:53,840
 

3441
01:29:51,980 --> 01:29:57,739
 does a lot of good things but it can be

3442
01:29:53,830 --> 01:29:57,739
 

3443
01:29:53,840 --> 01:30:01,219
 tricky so let's take a look at how you

3444
01:29:57,729 --> 01:30:01,219
 

3445
01:29:57,739 --> 01:30:04,969
 would close read it so this is based on

3446
01:30:01,209 --> 01:30:04,969
 

3447
01:30:01,219 --> 01:30:06,710
 a distill article that we wrote called

3448
01:30:04,959 --> 01:30:06,710
 

3449
01:30:04,969 --> 01:30:08,570
 how to use tea Snee effectively and

3450
01:30:06,700 --> 01:30:08,570
 

3451
01:30:06,710 --> 01:30:10,489
 because you can look it up but let's

3452
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:10,489
 

3453
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:12,829
 talk about what what are and what we did

3454
01:30:10,479 --> 01:30:12,829
 

3455
01:30:10,489 --> 01:30:14,869
 is we said we'll take some examples

3456
01:30:12,819 --> 01:30:14,869
 

3457
01:30:12,829 --> 01:30:16,340
 where we know ground truth even in high

3458
01:30:14,859 --> 01:30:16,340
 

3459
01:30:14,869 --> 01:30:18,679
 dimensions because we'll use completely

3460
01:30:16,330 --> 01:30:18,679
 

3461
01:30:16,340 --> 01:30:20,210
 synthetic data not like M Ness but

3462
01:30:18,669 --> 01:30:20,210
 

3463
01:30:18,679 --> 01:30:22,429
 something we truly can understand and

3464
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:22,429
 

3465
01:30:20,210 --> 01:30:27,110
 control and we'll look at what happens

3466
01:30:22,419 --> 01:30:27,110
 

3467
01:30:22,429 --> 01:30:28,280
 and get a sense of how to do it so one

3468
01:30:27,100 --> 01:30:28,280
 

3469
01:30:27,110 --> 01:30:29,900
 thing is that there's their hyper

3470
01:30:28,270 --> 01:30:29,900
 

3471
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:33,530
 parameters in just about all of these

3472
01:30:29,890 --> 01:30:33,530
 

3473
01:30:29,900 --> 01:30:35,270
 methods in tease me there's a hyper

3474
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:35,270
 

3475
01:30:33,530 --> 01:30:38,150
 parameter called perplexity which

3476
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:38,150
 

3477
01:30:35,270 --> 01:30:41,119
 roughly speaking tells you sort of how

3478
01:30:38,140 --> 01:30:41,119
 

3479
01:30:38,150 --> 01:30:43,579
 big you expect a neighborhood of a point

3480
01:30:41,109 --> 01:30:43,579
 

3481
01:30:41,119 --> 01:30:46,070
 to be like what what a near neighbor

3482
01:30:43,569 --> 01:30:46,070
 

3483
01:30:43,579 --> 01:30:48,289
 would be and it turns out that that

3484
01:30:46,060 --> 01:30:48,289
 

3485
01:30:46,070 --> 01:30:50,630
 makes a huge difference so let's take as

3486
01:30:48,279 --> 01:30:50,630
 

3487
01:30:48,289 --> 01:30:52,760
 an original two clusters that are

3488
01:30:50,620 --> 01:30:52,760
 

3489
01:30:50,630 --> 01:30:56,090
 Gaussian clusters that are fairly well

3490
01:30:52,750 --> 01:30:56,090
 

3491
01:30:52,760 --> 01:31:00,739
 separated and let's say that there are

3492
01:30:56,080 --> 01:31:00,739
 

3493
01:30:56,090 --> 01:31:02,360
 50 items each and if we create a system

3494
01:31:00,729 --> 01:31:02,360
 

3495
01:31:00,739 --> 01:31:04,909
 like this you'll start to see something

3496
01:31:02,350 --> 01:31:04,909
 

3497
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:07,219
 happening that it when perplexity is -

3498
01:31:04,899 --> 01:31:07,219
 

3499
01:31:04,909 --> 01:31:09,559
 you don't see those clusters at all like

3500
01:31:07,209 --> 01:31:09,559
 

3501
01:31:07,219 --> 01:31:14,030
 they just sort of explode into little

3502
01:31:09,549 --> 01:31:14,030
 

3503
01:31:09,559 --> 01:31:15,349
 tiny pieces largely because - is such a

3504
01:31:14,020 --> 01:31:15,349
 

3505
01:31:14,030 --> 01:31:17,690
 small number you're essentially just

3506
01:31:15,339 --> 01:31:17,690
 

3507
01:31:15,349 --> 01:31:19,219
 picking out tiny neighbors of like pairs

3508
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:19,219
 

3509
01:31:17,690 --> 01:31:20,750
 of points that are very near each other

3510
01:31:19,209 --> 01:31:20,750
 

3511
01:31:19,219 --> 01:31:23,659
 so you don't see anything close to

3512
01:31:20,740 --> 01:31:23,659
 

3513
01:31:20,750 --> 01:31:26,809
 global or medium scale you can see at 5

3514
01:31:23,649 --> 01:31:26,809
 

3515
01:31:23,659 --> 01:31:28,820
 you start to get those clusters out 30

3516
01:31:26,799 --> 01:31:28,820
 

3517
01:31:26,809 --> 01:31:29,180
 and 50 seems to do about right because

3518
01:31:28,810 --> 01:31:29,180
 

3519
01:31:28,820 --> 01:31:31,310
 in

3520
01:31:29,170 --> 01:31:31,310
 

3521
01:31:29,180 --> 01:31:33,140
 that matches roughly the scale those

3522
01:31:31,300 --> 01:31:33,140
 

3523
01:31:31,310 --> 01:31:35,420
 things and a hundred it just goes crazy

3524
01:31:33,130 --> 01:31:35,420
 

3525
01:31:33,140 --> 01:31:37,100
 largely because if your perplexity sort

3526
01:31:35,410 --> 01:31:37,100
 

3527
01:31:35,420 --> 01:31:40,660
 of matches the total number of data

3528
01:31:37,090 --> 01:31:40,660
 

3529
01:31:37,100 --> 01:31:40,660
 points everything starts to go wrong

3530
01:31:40,710 --> 01:31:40,710
 

3531
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:46,010
 what about the sizes of the clusters

3532
01:31:43,510 --> 01:31:46,010
 

3533
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:48,380
 that like spatial size that you see on

3534
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,380
 

3535
01:31:46,010 --> 01:31:50,450
 screen it turns out in t s-- t that

3536
01:31:48,370 --> 01:31:50,450
 

3537
01:31:48,380 --> 01:31:52,280
 means absolutely nothing and it's really

3538
01:31:50,440 --> 01:31:52,280
 

3539
01:31:50,450 --> 01:31:53,930
 important to keep that in mind and this

3540
01:31:52,270 --> 01:31:53,930
 

3541
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:55,280
 is where the adaptive nature of teeth

3542
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:55,280
 

3543
01:31:53,930 --> 01:31:58,340
 knee can be deceptive

3544
01:31:55,270 --> 01:31:58,340
 

3545
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:59,870
 so here the original data set is one

3546
01:31:58,330 --> 01:31:59,870
 

3547
01:31:58,340 --> 01:32:02,140
 cluster that's got a fairly large

3548
01:31:59,860 --> 01:32:02,140
 

3549
01:31:59,870 --> 01:32:04,850
 variance and one that's incredibly tight

3550
01:32:02,130 --> 01:32:04,850
 

3551
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:07,370
 again with perplexity too they just sort

3552
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:07,370
 

3553
01:32:04,850 --> 01:32:09,560
 of shatter but then you can see with

3554
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:09,560
 

3555
01:32:07,370 --> 01:32:12,080
 these other pop-rock cities for most of

3556
01:32:09,550 --> 01:32:12,080
 

3557
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:15,170
 the sort of mid ranges they actually

3558
01:32:12,070 --> 01:32:15,170
 

3559
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:16,970
 look exactly the same size visually and

3560
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:16,970
 

3561
01:32:15,170 --> 01:32:19,070
 you can view that as either a bug or a

3562
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:19,070
 

3563
01:32:16,970 --> 01:32:20,900
 feature depending on your situation but

3564
01:32:19,060 --> 01:32:20,900
 

3565
01:32:19,070 --> 01:32:22,760
 what you should never do is look at the

3566
01:32:20,890 --> 01:32:22,760
 

3567
01:32:20,900 --> 01:32:24,710
 sizes of things and assume that they

3568
01:32:22,750 --> 01:32:24,710
 

3569
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:26,900
 correspond to something real by the way

3570
01:32:24,700 --> 01:32:26,900
 

3571
01:32:24,710 --> 01:32:28,340
 once you get perplexity 100 in this case

3572
01:32:26,890 --> 01:32:28,340
 

3573
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:30,380
 I think there's a few more than 50 in

3574
01:32:28,330 --> 01:32:30,380
 

3575
01:32:28,340 --> 01:32:32,840
 each maybe 100 in each one it's you

3576
01:32:30,370 --> 01:32:32,840
 

3577
01:32:30,380 --> 01:32:35,000
 start to get some vague sense of the

3578
01:32:32,830 --> 01:32:35,000
 

3579
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:39,140
 distinction and sizes but it's certainly

3580
01:32:34,990 --> 01:32:39,140
 

3581
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:41,060
 not a perfect match similarly distances

3582
01:32:39,130 --> 01:32:41,060
 

3583
01:32:39,140 --> 01:32:43,160
 between clusters don't necessarily mean

3584
01:32:41,050 --> 01:32:43,160
 

3585
01:32:41,060 --> 01:32:45,410
 very much and it really depends on your

3586
01:32:43,150 --> 01:32:45,410
 

3587
01:32:43,160 --> 01:32:48,350
 hyper parameters you can see with some

3588
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:48,350
 

3589
01:32:45,410 --> 01:32:49,910
 parameters here these three things on

3590
01:32:48,340 --> 01:32:49,910
 

3591
01:32:48,350 --> 01:32:51,650
 the original you know the orange and the

3592
01:32:49,900 --> 01:32:51,650
 

3593
01:32:49,910 --> 01:32:54,440
 blue are very close they just end up

3594
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:54,440
 

3595
01:32:51,650 --> 01:32:56,450
 equally far in the middle only when you

3596
01:32:54,430 --> 01:32:56,450
 

3597
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:59,720
 get to very high perplexities does it

3598
01:32:56,440 --> 01:32:59,720
 

3599
01:32:56,450 --> 01:33:02,690
 actually capture them the other thing is

3600
01:32:59,710 --> 01:33:02,690
 

3601
01:32:59,720 --> 01:33:04,790
 that shapes can be meaningful but not on

3602
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:04,790
 

3603
01:33:02,690 --> 01:33:06,080
 so let's take these two things that are

3604
01:33:04,780 --> 01:33:06,080
 

3605
01:33:04,790 --> 01:33:09,260
 sort of various ellipsoids

3606
01:33:06,070 --> 01:33:09,260
 

3607
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:10,910
 if you take a very kind of scattered

3608
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:10,910
 

3609
01:33:09,260 --> 01:33:12,530
 ellipse not a very dramatic ellipsoid

3610
01:33:10,900 --> 01:33:12,530
 

3611
01:33:10,910 --> 01:33:15,080
 something that's like twice as long as

3612
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:15,080
 

3613
01:33:12,530 --> 01:33:17,510
 it is wide you can see again for certain

3614
01:33:15,070 --> 01:33:17,510
 

3615
01:33:15,080 --> 01:33:19,220
 perplexity values you do see the shape

3616
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:19,220
 

3617
01:33:17,510 --> 01:33:21,560
 for others it just turns into something

3618
01:33:19,210 --> 01:33:21,560
 

3619
01:33:19,220 --> 01:33:24,340
 either spherical or shattered when you

3620
01:33:21,550 --> 01:33:24,340
 

3621
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:26,660
 have to sort of very very thin

3622
01:33:24,330 --> 01:33:26,660
 

3623
01:33:24,340 --> 01:33:29,060
 distributions next to each other those

3624
01:33:26,650 --> 01:33:29,060
 

3625
01:33:26,660 --> 01:33:31,070
 actually do stay as those shapes

3626
01:33:29,050 --> 01:33:31,070
 

3627
01:33:29,060 --> 01:33:32,540
 actually persist but again with some

3628
01:33:31,060 --> 01:33:32,540
 

3629
01:33:31,070 --> 01:33:35,360
 slight variations you can see there's a

3630
01:33:32,530 --> 01:33:35,360
 

3631
01:33:32,540 --> 01:33:37,400
 little bit of like spurious curvature as

3632
01:33:35,350 --> 01:33:37,400
 

3633
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:39,350
 they repel each other there's this funny

3634
01:33:37,390 --> 01:33:39,350
 

3635
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:41,360
 kind of twist or break going on and so

3636
01:33:39,340 --> 01:33:41,360
 

3637
01:33:39,350 --> 01:33:43,730
 forth so to again important

3638
01:33:41,350 --> 01:33:43,730
 

3639
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:47,090
 if keeps this in mind as you look at

3640
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:47,090
 

3641
01:33:43,730 --> 01:33:49,760
 your ear TC so then let's think back on

3642
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:49,760
 

3643
01:33:47,090 --> 01:33:51,530
 that M mystical and I took a couple of

3644
01:33:49,750 --> 01:33:51,530
 

3645
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:53,420
 screenshots while I was using this tool

3646
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:53,420
 

3647
01:33:51,530 --> 01:33:55,640
 and we can see these phenomena at play

3648
01:33:53,410 --> 01:33:55,640
 

3649
01:33:53,420 --> 01:33:57,320
 so one thing is that if I stop too soon

3650
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:57,320
 

3651
01:33:55,640 --> 01:34:00,890
 I get a whole bunch of artifacts that

3652
01:33:57,310 --> 01:34:00,890
 

3653
01:33:57,320 --> 01:34:03,080
 sort of look like this that's a very

3654
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:03,080
 

3655
01:34:00,890 --> 01:34:04,820
 classic thing in TC if you've got these

3656
01:34:03,070 --> 01:34:04,820
 

3657
01:34:03,080 --> 01:34:07,790
 weird sort of angles that means you

3658
01:34:04,810 --> 01:34:07,790
 

3659
01:34:04,820 --> 01:34:11,510
 apply stop too soon but again let's see

3660
01:34:07,780 --> 01:34:11,510
 

3661
01:34:07,790 --> 01:34:13,580
 what we can guess and what we can so you

3662
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:13,580
 

3663
01:34:11,510 --> 01:34:15,890
 know we have these fours at the top

3664
01:34:13,570 --> 01:34:15,890
 

3665
01:34:13,580 --> 01:34:18,200
 these things in pink those may not

3666
01:34:15,880 --> 01:34:18,200
 

3667
01:34:15,890 --> 01:34:20,360
 really be separated into two clusters as

3668
01:34:18,190 --> 01:34:20,360
 

3669
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:21,920
 we saw with a sort of long thin

3670
01:34:20,350 --> 01:34:21,920
 

3671
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:23,810
 distributions before they can kind of

3672
01:34:21,910 --> 01:34:23,810
 

3673
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:26,750
 break up even though they clearly were a

3674
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:26,750
 

3675
01:34:23,810 --> 01:34:28,310
 cluster at the very bottom that you

3676
01:34:26,740 --> 01:34:28,310
 

3677
01:34:26,750 --> 01:34:31,190
 could note that most of these clusters

3678
01:34:28,300 --> 01:34:31,190
 

3679
01:34:28,310 --> 01:34:33,980
 seem roughly equally far apart they

3680
01:34:31,180 --> 01:34:33,980
 

3681
01:34:31,190 --> 01:34:35,450
 probably are not and so that's something

3682
01:34:33,970 --> 01:34:35,450
 

3683
01:34:33,980 --> 01:34:37,340
 we need to keep in mind the clusters

3684
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:37,340
 

3685
01:34:35,450 --> 01:34:38,960
 exist but we don't want to talk about

3686
01:34:37,330 --> 01:34:38,960
 

3687
01:34:37,340 --> 01:34:41,810
 the relationships between those two

3688
01:34:38,950 --> 01:34:41,810
 

3689
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:44,030
 clusters without a great deal of care on

3690
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:44,030
 

3691
01:34:41,810 --> 01:34:46,070
 the other hand the cluster of ones that

3692
01:34:44,020 --> 01:34:46,070
 

3693
01:34:44,030 --> 01:34:47,960
 actually showed sort of a progression

3694
01:34:46,060 --> 01:34:47,960
 

3695
01:34:46,070 --> 01:34:50,030
 from you know tilting to the right

3696
01:34:47,950 --> 01:34:50,030
 

3697
01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:51,740
 tilting to the left that was probably a

3698
01:34:50,020 --> 01:34:51,740
 

3699
01:34:50,030 --> 01:34:54,590
 real thing like that thing probably is

3700
01:34:51,730 --> 01:34:54,590
 

3701
01:34:51,740 --> 01:34:56,660
 not just some spherical distribution in

3702
01:34:54,580 --> 01:34:56,660
 

3703
01:34:54,590 --> 01:34:59,240
 space okay

3704
01:34:56,650 --> 01:34:59,240
 

3705
01:34:56,660 --> 01:35:01,100
 so T stays very good but there's a new

3706
01:34:59,230 --> 01:35:01,100
 

3707
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:02,930
 kid on the block and that's something

3708
01:35:01,090 --> 01:35:02,930
 

3709
01:35:01,100 --> 01:35:04,730
 called u map and I just want to give a

3710
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:04,730
 

3711
01:35:02,930 --> 01:35:07,880
 nod to this briefly it's something that

3712
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:07,880
 

3713
01:35:04,730 --> 01:35:11,180
 came out fairly recently and the idea

3714
01:35:07,870 --> 01:35:11,180
 

3715
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:12,650
 here is that the purpose of the method

3716
01:35:11,170 --> 01:35:12,650
 

3717
01:35:11,180 --> 01:35:14,660
 is there's a couple of things that it's

3718
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:14,660
 

3719
01:35:12,650 --> 01:35:16,280
 aiming to do better than T's needs so

3720
01:35:14,650 --> 01:35:16,280
 

3721
01:35:14,660 --> 01:35:19,010
 one is simply from the implementation

3722
01:35:16,270 --> 01:35:19,010
 

3723
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:21,260
 point of view trying to be faster TC is

3724
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,260
 

3725
01:35:19,010 --> 01:35:23,570
 actually fairly you know takes a while

3726
01:35:21,250 --> 01:35:23,570
 

3727
01:35:21,260 --> 01:35:25,220
 to actually light things out the other

3728
01:35:23,560 --> 01:35:25,220
 

3729
01:35:23,570 --> 01:35:27,950
 thing is that the way that T's me

3730
01:35:25,210 --> 01:35:27,950
 

3731
01:35:25,220 --> 01:35:30,080
 algorithms scales is that the more

3732
01:35:27,940 --> 01:35:30,080
 

3733
01:35:27,950 --> 01:35:32,480
 dimensions you're embedding in tune the

3734
01:35:30,070 --> 01:35:32,480
 

3735
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:34,130
 slower it gets that generally is not a

3736
01:35:32,470 --> 01:35:34,130
 

3737
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:37,490
 problem for visualization because we

3738
01:35:34,120 --> 01:35:37,490
 

3739
01:35:34,130 --> 01:35:38,870
 only want two or three dimensions but if

3740
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:38,870
 

3741
01:35:37,490 --> 01:35:42,050
 you want to have a pre-processing step

3742
01:35:38,860 --> 01:35:42,050
 

3743
01:35:38,870 --> 01:35:44,240
 where you're focusing down then you

3744
01:35:42,040 --> 01:35:44,240
 

3745
01:35:42,050 --> 01:35:46,040
 actually might care about that and also

3746
01:35:44,230 --> 01:35:46,040
 

3747
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:48,350
 it seems to capture global structure a

3748
01:35:46,030 --> 01:35:48,350
 

3749
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:50,590
 little bit better the way it works and

3750
01:35:48,340 --> 01:35:50,590
 

3751
01:35:48,350 --> 01:35:53,210
 I'm going to give you sort of a rough

3752
01:35:50,580 --> 01:35:53,210
 

3753
01:35:50,590 --> 01:35:54,670
 description of this is that it uses

3754
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:54,670
 

3755
01:35:53,210 --> 01:35:57,489
 ideas from

3756
01:35:54,660 --> 01:35:57,489
 

3757
01:35:54,670 --> 01:36:00,880
 and believe it or not category theory in

3758
01:35:57,479 --> 01:36:00,880
 

3759
01:35:57,489 --> 01:36:02,650
 order to try to capture the apology very

3760
01:36:00,870 --> 01:36:02,650
 

3761
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:04,600
 explicitly it's a little bit like

3762
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:04,600
 

3763
01:36:02,650 --> 01:36:07,090
 topological data analysis that you know

3764
01:36:04,590 --> 01:36:07,090
 

3765
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:10,270
 carlson has done but it seems it extends

3766
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:10,270
 

3767
01:36:07,090 --> 01:36:12,219
 beyond this essentially on by doing that

3768
01:36:10,260 --> 01:36:12,219
 

3769
01:36:10,270 --> 01:36:15,340
 I think this is why it gets the global

3770
01:36:12,209 --> 01:36:15,340
 

3771
01:36:12,219 --> 01:36:17,530
 structure a little bit better but we can

3772
01:36:15,330 --> 01:36:17,530
 

3773
01:36:15,340 --> 01:36:19,090
 actually see compare side-by-side or

3774
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:19,090
 

3775
01:36:17,530 --> 01:36:21,940
 rather the authors of the paper compare

3776
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:21,940
 

3777
01:36:19,090 --> 01:36:23,830
 side-by-side how you map and teeth need

3778
01:36:21,930 --> 01:36:23,830
 

3779
01:36:21,940 --> 01:36:26,230
 work and they do this on end this which

3780
01:36:23,820 --> 01:36:26,230
 

3781
01:36:23,830 --> 01:36:28,690
 we just saw so among other things so on

3782
01:36:26,220 --> 01:36:28,690
 

3783
01:36:26,230 --> 01:36:32,250
 the left column here we see you map on

3784
01:36:28,680 --> 01:36:32,250
 

3785
01:36:28,690 --> 01:36:35,860
 the right column is T Snee so in this

3786
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:35,860
 

3787
01:36:32,250 --> 01:36:37,870
 row here we see M nest and in fact this

3788
01:36:35,850 --> 01:36:37,870
 

3789
01:36:35,860 --> 01:36:40,989
 looks fairly familiar this looks much

3790
01:36:37,860 --> 01:36:40,989
 

3791
01:36:37,870 --> 01:36:43,090
 like what we saw in our 3d view however

3792
01:36:40,979 --> 01:36:43,090
 

3793
01:36:40,989 --> 01:36:45,699
 here when we look at you map we actually

3794
01:36:43,080 --> 01:36:45,699
 

3795
01:36:43,090 --> 01:36:48,969
 start to see interesting differences in

3796
01:36:45,689 --> 01:36:48,969
 

3797
01:36:45,699 --> 01:36:50,469
 distances between the clusters and we it

3798
01:36:48,959 --> 01:36:50,469
 

3799
01:36:48,969 --> 01:36:51,760
 actually seems to correspond to

3800
01:36:50,459 --> 01:36:51,760
 

3801
01:36:50,469 --> 01:36:53,860
 something real when you look at things

3802
01:36:51,750 --> 01:36:53,860
 

3803
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:56,020
 similarly if you look at some of these

3804
01:36:53,850 --> 01:36:56,020
 

3805
01:36:53,860 --> 01:36:58,330
 other things you can definitely see more

3806
01:36:56,010 --> 01:36:58,330
 

3807
01:36:56,020 --> 01:37:00,280
 global activity sort of the interesting

3808
01:36:58,320 --> 01:37:00,280
 

3809
01:36:58,330 --> 01:37:02,590
 global structure in this for example

3810
01:37:00,270 --> 01:37:02,590
 

3811
01:37:00,280 --> 01:37:05,940
 which I think this is word Tyvek or some

3812
01:37:02,580 --> 01:37:05,940
 

3813
01:37:02,590 --> 01:37:07,750
 word vector versus T sneeze so this is

3814
01:37:05,930 --> 01:37:07,750
 

3815
01:37:05,940 --> 01:37:09,810
 something that's definitely worth doing

3816
01:37:07,740 --> 01:37:09,810
 

3817
01:37:07,750 --> 01:37:12,190
 I think an interest of time I will not

3818
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:12,190
 

3819
01:37:09,810 --> 01:37:14,560
 do a demo of this but there's actually a

3820
01:37:12,180 --> 01:37:14,560
 

3821
01:37:12,190 --> 01:37:16,449
 very beautiful demo online by lien 7

3822
01:37:14,550 --> 01:37:16,449
 

3823
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:18,280
 that lets you compare these directly

3824
01:37:16,439 --> 01:37:18,280
 

3825
01:37:16,449 --> 01:37:20,560
 with the audio data and he does a fairly

3826
01:37:18,270 --> 01:37:20,560
 

3827
01:37:18,280 --> 01:37:24,850
 careful analysis much like the one that

3828
01:37:20,550 --> 01:37:24,850
 

3829
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:28,960
 we did in our distal article so yeah

3830
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:28,960
 

3831
01:37:24,850 --> 01:37:30,400
 there's this is another reference that I

3832
01:37:28,950 --> 01:37:30,400
 

3833
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:31,840
 would sort of recommend looking at later

3834
01:37:30,390 --> 01:37:31,840
 

3835
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:33,670
 something called The Beginner's Guide to

3836
01:37:31,830 --> 01:37:33,670
 

3837
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:34,810
 dimensionality reduction which lets you

3838
01:37:33,660 --> 01:37:34,810
 

3839
01:37:33,670 --> 01:37:38,650
 sort of compare these things

3840
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:38,650
 

3841
01:37:34,810 --> 01:37:40,480
 side-by-side okay there's one last topic

3842
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:40,480
 

3843
01:37:38,650 --> 01:37:42,160
 I want to talk about while we're talking

3844
01:37:40,470 --> 01:37:42,160
 

3845
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:45,250
 about high dimensional space which is

3846
01:37:42,150 --> 01:37:45,250
 

3847
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:47,320
 that the geometry is very weird in many

3848
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:47,320
 

3849
01:37:45,250 --> 01:37:48,730
 ways it's quite the opposite of what we

3850
01:37:47,310 --> 01:37:48,730
 

3851
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:51,489
 learn in - in three dimensions

3852
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:51,489
 

3853
01:37:48,730 --> 01:37:53,050
 so here are four statements and you have

3854
01:37:51,479 --> 01:37:53,050
 

3855
01:37:51,489 --> 01:37:55,449
 to pepper these statements with sort of

3856
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:55,449
 

3857
01:37:53,050 --> 01:37:56,830
 the usual mathematical caveats but to a

3858
01:37:55,439 --> 01:37:56,830
 

3859
01:37:55,449 --> 01:37:58,690
 first approximation they're all true

3860
01:37:56,820 --> 01:37:58,690
 

3861
01:37:56,830 --> 01:38:00,739
 that you know if I pick two vectors at

3862
01:37:58,680 --> 01:38:00,739
 

3863
01:37:58,690 --> 01:38:03,440
 random they're gonna be at right angles

3864
01:38:00,729 --> 01:38:03,440
 

3865
01:38:00,739 --> 01:38:04,849
 um a Gaussian distribution doesn't look

3866
01:38:03,430 --> 01:38:04,849
 

3867
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:07,789
 like a bell curve it looks like a

3868
01:38:04,839 --> 01:38:07,789
 

3869
01:38:04,849 --> 01:38:09,650
 uniform distribution on a sphere random

3870
01:38:07,779 --> 01:38:09,650
 

3871
01:38:07,789 --> 01:38:11,059
 matrices are basically orthogonal

3872
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:11,059
 

3873
01:38:09,650 --> 01:38:12,619
 matrices this is something that's I

3874
01:38:11,049 --> 01:38:12,619
 

3875
01:38:11,059 --> 01:38:14,539
 think a little bit less appreciated than

3876
01:38:12,609 --> 01:38:14,539
 

3877
01:38:12,619 --> 01:38:16,460
 those first two facts but it essentially

3878
01:38:14,529 --> 01:38:16,460
 

3879
01:38:14,539 --> 01:38:18,469
 follows directly from them and then one

3880
01:38:16,450 --> 01:38:18,469
 

3881
01:38:16,460 --> 01:38:20,989
 thing which I think is definitely not

3882
01:38:18,459 --> 01:38:20,989
 

3883
01:38:18,469 --> 01:38:22,730
 well appreciated is that random walks in

3884
01:38:20,979 --> 01:38:22,730
 

3885
01:38:20,989 --> 01:38:26,150
 very high dimensions all have the same

3886
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:26,150
 

3887
01:38:22,730 --> 01:38:28,909
 shape more or less probably and that's a

3888
01:38:26,140 --> 01:38:28,909
 

3889
01:38:26,150 --> 01:38:31,400
 very weird but true thing and I want to

3890
01:38:28,899 --> 01:38:31,400
 

3891
01:38:28,909 --> 01:38:33,559
 sort of talk a little bit about why that

3892
01:38:31,390 --> 01:38:33,559
 

3893
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:34,909
 matters in machine learning so one thing

3894
01:38:33,549 --> 01:38:34,909
 

3895
01:38:33,559 --> 01:38:36,710
 that you see very often is that people

3896
01:38:34,899 --> 01:38:36,710
 

3897
01:38:34,909 --> 01:38:38,329
 will be interested in some process

3898
01:38:36,700 --> 01:38:38,329
 

3899
01:38:36,710 --> 01:38:40,309
 happening in high dimensions and

3900
01:38:38,319 --> 01:38:40,309
 

3901
01:38:38,329 --> 01:38:43,099
 gradient descent trajectories are a

3902
01:38:40,299 --> 01:38:43,099
 

3903
01:38:40,309 --> 01:38:46,039
 classic example of this and you'll see

3904
01:38:43,089 --> 01:38:46,039
 

3905
01:38:43,099 --> 01:38:47,329
 um it sort of I've so two papers here

3906
01:38:46,029 --> 01:38:47,329
 

3907
01:38:46,039 --> 01:38:49,940
 there's this really nice paper from

3908
01:38:47,319 --> 01:38:49,940
 

3909
01:38:47,329 --> 01:38:51,530
 Eliana Lorch on visualizing deep network

3910
01:38:49,930 --> 01:38:51,530
 

3911
01:38:49,940 --> 01:38:53,090
 training trajectories in which she finds

3912
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:53,090
 

3913
01:38:51,530 --> 01:38:59,360
 these very interesting kind of ListView

3914
01:38:53,080 --> 01:38:59,360
 

3915
01:38:53,090 --> 01:39:01,849
 patterns if you do PCA on on the weights

3916
01:38:59,350 --> 01:39:01,849
 

3917
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:03,110
 and similar there's another recent very

3918
01:39:01,839 --> 01:39:03,110
 

3919
01:39:01,849 --> 01:39:05,630
 interesting paper about the lost

3920
01:39:03,100 --> 01:39:05,630
 

3921
01:39:03,110 --> 01:39:09,340
 landscape of neural networks and they

3922
01:39:05,620 --> 01:39:09,340
 

3923
01:39:05,630 --> 01:39:12,469
 too are sort of projecting by PCA

3924
01:39:09,330 --> 01:39:12,469
 

3925
01:39:09,340 --> 01:39:14,239
 loss basically the trajectory training

3926
01:39:12,459 --> 01:39:14,239
 

3927
01:39:12,469 --> 01:39:15,499
 trajectories and in each case you see

3928
01:39:14,229 --> 01:39:15,499
 

3929
01:39:14,239 --> 01:39:18,170
 they get these kind of things that look

3930
01:39:15,489 --> 01:39:18,170
 

3931
01:39:15,499 --> 01:39:21,769
 like Parral parabolas essentially

3932
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:21,769
 

3933
01:39:18,170 --> 01:39:23,150
 roughly speaking and the question is

3934
01:39:21,759 --> 01:39:23,150
 

3935
01:39:21,769 --> 01:39:26,090
 what can we read into that about

3936
01:39:23,140 --> 01:39:26,090
 

3937
01:39:23,150 --> 01:39:28,969
 training and the answer is it's not

3938
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:28,969
 

3939
01:39:26,090 --> 01:39:31,610
 clear what we can because it turns out

3940
01:39:28,959 --> 01:39:31,610
 

3941
01:39:28,969 --> 01:39:35,449
 that if you look at a random walk and

3942
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:35,449
 

3943
01:39:31,610 --> 01:39:38,150
 project it by PCA you will actually see

3944
01:39:35,439 --> 01:39:38,150
 

3945
01:39:35,449 --> 01:39:40,429
 exactly these same basic phenomena of

3946
01:39:38,140 --> 01:39:40,429
 

3947
01:39:38,150 --> 01:39:42,650
 list issue patterns that essentially the

3948
01:39:40,419 --> 01:39:42,650
 

3949
01:39:40,429 --> 01:39:45,530
 principal components when you project

3950
01:39:42,640 --> 01:39:45,530
 

3951
01:39:42,650 --> 01:39:47,119
 down look like um cosines and this is

3952
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:47,119
 

3953
01:39:45,530 --> 01:39:51,110
 again this there's a bunch of ways to

3954
01:39:47,109 --> 01:39:51,110
 

3955
01:39:47,119 --> 01:39:52,789
 see this there's a recent paper from

3956
01:39:51,100 --> 01:39:52,789
 

3957
01:39:51,110 --> 01:39:55,340
 ntek Nemean salt Dickstein that shows

3958
01:39:52,779 --> 01:39:55,340
 

3959
01:39:52,789 --> 01:39:57,260
 this this is where this diagram is from

3960
01:39:55,330 --> 01:39:57,260
 

3961
01:39:55,340 --> 01:39:58,909
 and it's it's a sort of a shocking fact

3962
01:39:57,250 --> 01:39:58,909
 

3963
01:39:57,260 --> 01:40:01,159
 because we think about random walks as

3964
01:39:58,899 --> 01:40:01,159
 

3965
01:39:58,909 --> 01:40:03,170
 these really weird jittery things but

3966
01:40:01,149 --> 01:40:03,170
 

3967
01:40:01,159 --> 01:40:05,239
 that's a low dimensional thinking so one

3968
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:05,239
 

3969
01:40:03,170 --> 01:40:07,579
 general thing is that whenever you're

3970
01:40:05,229 --> 01:40:07,579
 

3971
01:40:05,239 --> 01:40:08,900
 doing this kind of visualization of sort

3972
01:40:07,569 --> 01:40:08,900
 

3973
01:40:07,579 --> 01:40:10,909
 of anything at high dimensional space

3974
01:40:08,890 --> 01:40:10,909
 

3975
01:40:08,900 --> 01:40:12,890
 compared with the most random baseline

3976
01:40:10,899 --> 01:40:12,890
 

3977
01:40:10,909 --> 01:40:17,210
 you can and it'll

3978
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:17,210
 

3979
01:40:12,890 --> 01:40:18,710
 probably bear fruit alright so bringing

3980
01:40:17,200 --> 01:40:18,710
 

3981
01:40:17,210 --> 01:40:22,010
 high dimensional space and visualization

3982
01:40:18,700 --> 01:40:22,010
 

3983
01:40:18,710 --> 01:40:25,930
 together again let's take a look at a

3984
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:25,930
 

3985
01:40:22,010 --> 01:40:30,380
 quick demo so we were curious about

3986
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:30,380
 

3987
01:40:25,930 --> 01:40:32,690
 working with a research model a true

3988
01:40:30,370 --> 01:40:32,690
 

3989
01:40:30,380 --> 01:40:34,580
 research model at Google and we ended up

3990
01:40:32,680 --> 01:40:34,580
 

3991
01:40:32,690 --> 01:40:39,730
 working with some of the folks who were

3992
01:40:34,570 --> 01:40:39,730
 

3993
01:40:34,580 --> 01:40:42,710
 doing multilingual translation and there

3994
01:40:39,720 --> 01:40:42,710
 

3995
01:40:39,730 --> 01:40:46,430
 some of you may be familiar with this it

3996
01:40:42,700 --> 01:40:46,430
 

3997
01:40:42,710 --> 01:40:49,070
 was the first time that in this case

3998
01:40:46,420 --> 01:40:49,070
 

3999
01:40:46,430 --> 01:40:51,560
 Google came up with a translation system

4000
01:40:49,060 --> 01:40:51,560
 

4001
01:40:49,070 --> 01:40:55,190
 that could take as input multiple

4002
01:40:51,550 --> 01:40:55,190
 

4003
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:58,250
 languages and could output translations

4004
01:40:55,180 --> 01:40:58,250
 

4005
01:40:55,190 --> 01:41:01,970
 into multiple languages without having

4006
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:01,970
 

4007
01:40:58,250 --> 01:41:05,000
 seen training data on all the pairs of

4008
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:05,000
 

4009
01:41:01,970 --> 01:41:07,670
 languages it was translating so in other

4010
01:41:04,990 --> 01:41:07,670
 

4011
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:10,640
 words if you look at this slide imagine

4012
01:41:07,660 --> 01:41:10,640
 

4013
01:41:07,670 --> 01:41:12,440
 a system that has trained on sentences

4014
01:41:10,630 --> 01:41:12,440
 

4015
01:41:10,640 --> 01:41:14,480
 that trends are translated between

4016
01:41:12,430 --> 01:41:14,480
 

4017
01:41:12,440 --> 01:41:17,780
 English and Japanese and Japanese in

4018
01:41:14,470 --> 01:41:17,780
 

4019
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:20,390
 English and then also English and Korean

4020
01:41:17,770 --> 01:41:20,390
 

4021
01:41:17,780 --> 01:41:22,190
 Korean and English okay that's the

4022
01:41:20,380 --> 01:41:22,190
 

4023
01:41:20,390 --> 01:41:24,410
 training data that's all the training

4024
01:41:22,180 --> 01:41:24,410
 

4025
01:41:22,190 --> 01:41:27,350
 data and then all of a sudden the system

4026
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:27,350
 

4027
01:41:24,410 --> 01:41:29,990
 can start outputting high-quality

4028
01:41:27,340 --> 01:41:29,990
 

4029
01:41:27,350 --> 01:41:32,990
 translations straight from Japanese to

4030
01:41:29,980 --> 01:41:32,990
 

4031
01:41:29,990 --> 01:41:35,720
 Korean and vice versa without ever

4032
01:41:32,980 --> 01:41:35,720
 

4033
01:41:32,990 --> 01:41:39,800
 having seen a single sentence directly

4034
01:41:35,710 --> 01:41:39,800
 

4035
01:41:35,720 --> 01:41:41,840
 in those directions ok so part of the

4036
01:41:39,790 --> 01:41:41,840
 

4037
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:43,430
 question is how part of the question

4038
01:41:41,830 --> 01:41:43,430
 

4039
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:46,730
 there was how how are these systems

4040
01:41:43,420 --> 01:41:46,730
 

4041
01:41:43,430 --> 01:41:49,310
 doing this and so to look into that we

4042
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:49,310
 

4043
01:41:46,730 --> 01:41:50,720
 decided to visualize you know the way

4044
01:41:49,300 --> 01:41:50,720
 

4045
01:41:49,310 --> 01:41:53,360
 these systems are set up there is the

4046
01:41:50,710 --> 01:41:53,360
 

4047
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:54,710
 encoder there is the decoder and in the

4048
01:41:53,350 --> 01:41:54,710
 

4049
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:57,170
 middle there there is an attention

4050
01:41:54,700 --> 01:41:57,170
 

4051
01:41:54,710 --> 01:42:00,080
 vector and so we decided to visualize

4052
01:41:57,160 --> 01:42:00,080
 

4053
01:41:57,170 --> 01:42:02,810
 that attention vector so just very

4054
01:42:00,070 --> 01:42:02,810
 

4055
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:06,760
 briefly walk you through what might a

4056
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:06,760
 

4057
01:42:02,810 --> 01:42:10,040
 visualization like that look like oh and

4058
01:42:06,750 --> 01:42:10,040
 

4059
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:12,680
 before I do that let me ask let me

4060
01:42:10,030 --> 01:42:12,680
 

4061
01:42:10,040 --> 01:42:15,380
 actually step back and tell you about

4062
01:42:12,670 --> 01:42:15,380
 

4063
01:42:12,680 --> 01:42:18,830
 the research questions the scientists

4064
01:42:15,370 --> 01:42:18,830
 

4065
01:42:15,380 --> 01:42:20,789
 had so when we talked to them they were

4066
01:42:18,820 --> 01:42:20,789
 

4067
01:42:18,830 --> 01:42:24,989
 saying you know we don't know how these

4068
01:42:20,779 --> 01:42:24,989
 

4069
01:42:20,789 --> 01:42:28,199
 sims are resolving the the multilingual

4070
01:42:24,979 --> 01:42:28,199
 

4071
01:42:24,989 --> 01:42:30,449
 space of embeddings is it that the

4072
01:42:28,189 --> 01:42:30,449
 

4073
01:42:28,199 --> 01:42:33,149
 system is doing something like what you

4074
01:42:30,439 --> 01:42:33,149
 

4075
01:42:30,449 --> 01:42:35,909
 see on the left here where imagine I am

4076
01:42:33,139 --> 01:42:35,909
 

4077
01:42:33,149 --> 01:42:38,939
 coloring each language in a different

4078
01:42:35,899 --> 01:42:38,939
 

4079
01:42:35,909 --> 01:42:42,569
 color right so you have English is blue

4080
01:42:38,929 --> 01:42:42,569
 

4081
01:42:38,939 --> 01:42:43,829
 and Japanese is red is green and Korean

4082
01:42:42,559 --> 01:42:43,829
 

4083
01:42:42,569 --> 01:42:47,219
 is yellow and so forth

4084
01:42:43,819 --> 01:42:47,219
 

4085
01:42:43,829 --> 01:42:49,649
 is it that the my system is you know

4086
01:42:47,209 --> 01:42:49,649
 

4087
01:42:47,219 --> 01:42:52,769
 creating an embedding space all of

4088
01:42:49,639 --> 01:42:52,769
 

4089
01:42:49,649 --> 01:42:54,359
 English in one corner and all of the

4090
01:42:52,759 --> 01:42:54,359
 

4091
01:42:52,769 --> 01:42:56,519
 Japanese embeddings are in the other

4092
01:42:54,349 --> 01:42:56,519
 

4093
01:42:54,359 --> 01:42:58,409
 corner and all the Korean buddies are in

4094
01:42:56,509 --> 01:42:58,409
 

4095
01:42:56,519 --> 01:43:03,569
 the other corner and then it maps

4096
01:42:58,399 --> 01:43:03,569
 

4097
01:42:58,409 --> 01:43:06,030
 between these spaces or is the question

4098
01:43:03,559 --> 01:43:06,030
 

4099
01:43:03,569 --> 01:43:08,489
 is is what's happening more like what

4100
01:43:06,020 --> 01:43:08,489
 

4101
01:43:06,030 --> 01:43:11,099
 you see on the right which is a little

4102
01:43:08,479 --> 01:43:11,099
 

4103
01:43:08,489 --> 01:43:13,229
 bit more of a mess but where the system

4104
01:43:11,089 --> 01:43:13,229
 

4105
01:43:11,099 --> 01:43:17,239
 is bringing together these different

4106
01:43:13,219 --> 01:43:17,239
 

4107
01:43:13,229 --> 01:43:20,399
 languages and in bringing them together

4108
01:43:17,229 --> 01:43:20,399
 

4109
01:43:17,239 --> 01:43:25,109
 it's doing something where it doesn't

4110
01:43:20,389 --> 01:43:25,109
 

4111
01:43:20,399 --> 01:43:29,099
 care as much about the string home being

4112
01:43:25,099 --> 01:43:29,099
 

4113
01:43:25,109 --> 01:43:31,439
 different from this string Casa it

4114
01:43:29,089 --> 01:43:31,439
 

4115
01:43:29,099 --> 01:43:34,979
 really cares more that these are

4116
01:43:31,429 --> 01:43:34,979
 

4117
01:43:31,439 --> 01:43:36,749
 semantically related so is the system

4118
01:43:34,969 --> 01:43:36,749
 

4119
01:43:34,979 --> 01:43:40,889
 paying attention more to the semantics

4120
01:43:36,739 --> 01:43:40,889
 

4121
01:43:36,749 --> 01:43:43,439
 of these words versus paying attention

4122
01:43:40,879 --> 01:43:43,439
 

4123
01:43:40,889 --> 01:43:45,689
 to what languages it came from so in

4124
01:43:43,429 --> 01:43:45,689
 

4125
01:43:43,439 --> 01:43:48,119
 order to answer that question we decided

4126
01:43:45,679 --> 01:43:48,119
 

4127
01:43:45,689 --> 01:43:50,699
 to create to work with with the

4128
01:43:48,109 --> 01:43:50,699
 

4129
01:43:48,119 --> 01:43:52,799
 visualization imagine I have a sentence

4130
01:43:50,689 --> 01:43:52,799
 

4131
01:43:50,699 --> 01:43:55,010
 like the stratosphere extends from 10

4132
01:43:52,789 --> 01:43:55,010
 

4133
01:43:52,799 --> 01:43:58,769
 kilometers to 50 kilometers in altitude

4134
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:58,769
 

4135
01:43:55,010 --> 01:44:01,109
 okay that sentence may look like this

4136
01:43:58,759 --> 01:44:01,109
 

4137
01:43:58,769 --> 01:44:04,409
 okay in in embeddings

4138
01:44:01,099 --> 01:44:04,409
 

4139
01:44:01,109 --> 01:44:07,559
 space and I have all the words there and

4140
01:44:04,399 --> 01:44:07,559
 

4141
01:44:04,409 --> 01:44:10,879
 then I connect those dots in high

4142
01:44:07,549 --> 01:44:10,879
 

4143
01:44:07,559 --> 01:44:14,189
 dimensional space and voila this is my

4144
01:44:10,869 --> 01:44:14,189
 

4145
01:44:10,879 --> 01:44:17,039
 sentence now when I translate that

4146
01:44:14,179 --> 01:44:17,039
 

4147
01:44:14,189 --> 01:44:20,280
 sentence into another language in this

4148
01:44:17,029 --> 01:44:20,280
 

4149
01:44:17,039 --> 01:44:22,799
 case here Portuguese does my embedding

4150
01:44:20,270 --> 01:44:22,799
 

4151
01:44:20,280 --> 01:44:24,780
 space look like this where English is in

4152
01:44:22,789 --> 01:44:24,780
 

4153
01:44:22,799 --> 01:44:27,929
 one corner and Portuguese is on the

4154
01:44:24,770 --> 01:44:27,929
 

4155
01:44:24,780 --> 01:44:31,060
 other corner or does it look more like

4156
01:44:27,919 --> 01:44:31,060
 

4157
01:44:27,929 --> 01:44:35,620
 this where the two languages are

4158
01:44:31,050 --> 01:44:35,620
 

4159
01:44:31,060 --> 01:44:39,070
 kind of put together right and so to

4160
01:44:35,610 --> 01:44:39,070
 

4161
01:44:35,620 --> 01:44:41,910
 give you a big reveal let me show you

4162
01:44:39,060 --> 01:44:41,910
 

4163
01:44:39,070 --> 01:44:46,390
 what we did with the embedding projector

4164
01:44:41,900 --> 01:44:46,390
 

4165
01:44:41,910 --> 01:44:49,960
 so this here is a visualization of a

4166
01:44:46,380 --> 01:44:49,960
 

4167
01:44:46,390 --> 01:44:53,680
 multilingual system that takes in three

4168
01:44:49,950 --> 01:44:53,680
 

4169
01:44:49,960 --> 01:44:57,010
 languages English Japanese and Korean

4170
01:44:53,670 --> 01:44:57,010
 

4171
01:44:53,680 --> 01:45:00,450
 I am coloring sentences here each

4172
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:00,450
 

4173
01:44:57,010 --> 01:45:03,730
 sentence I'm coloring in its in its

4174
01:45:00,440 --> 01:45:03,730
 

4175
01:45:00,450 --> 01:45:06,730
 source language so English is blue

4176
01:45:03,720 --> 01:45:06,730
 

4177
01:45:03,730 --> 01:45:09,250
 Korean is red Japanese is yellow

4178
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:09,250
 

4179
01:45:06,730 --> 01:45:11,590
 my first question is it looks convoluted

4180
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:11,590
 

4181
01:45:09,250 --> 01:45:13,990
 and weird but my first question is do

4182
01:45:11,580 --> 01:45:13,990
 

4183
01:45:11,590 --> 01:45:16,480
 you see a big neighborhood of red in one

4184
01:45:13,980 --> 01:45:16,480
 

4185
01:45:13,990 --> 01:45:18,730
 part a big neighborhood of yellow on

4186
01:45:16,470 --> 01:45:18,730
 

4187
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:23,500
 another corner and a big neighborhood of

4188
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:23,500
 

4189
01:45:18,730 --> 01:45:25,930
 red do you see separate colors no right

4190
01:45:23,490 --> 01:45:25,930
 

4191
01:45:23,500 --> 01:45:27,790
 you don't see this so the first time we

4192
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:27,790
 

4193
01:45:25,930 --> 01:45:28,480
 saw this we're like ooh this is

4194
01:45:27,780 --> 01:45:28,480
 

4195
01:45:27,790 --> 01:45:32,410
 interesting

4196
01:45:28,470 --> 01:45:32,410
 

4197
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:36,610
 okay so then we started we're like this

4198
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:36,610
 

4199
01:45:32,410 --> 01:45:39,100
 could be an interesting sign so then let

4200
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:39,100
 

4201
01:45:36,610 --> 01:45:40,150
 me start looking at my favorite sentence

4202
01:45:39,090 --> 01:45:40,150
 

4203
01:45:39,100 --> 01:45:42,520
 here I'm going to highlight that

4204
01:45:40,140 --> 01:45:42,520
 

4205
01:45:40,150 --> 01:45:45,370
 sentence the stratosphere is in the

4206
01:45:42,510 --> 01:45:45,370
 

4207
01:45:42,520 --> 01:45:47,200
 range of 10 to 15 kilometers and when I

4208
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:47,200
 

4209
01:45:45,370 --> 01:45:49,600
 highlight this on the embedding

4210
01:45:47,190 --> 01:45:49,600
 

4211
01:45:47,200 --> 01:45:52,180
 projector it highlights for me and

4212
01:45:49,590 --> 01:45:52,180
 

4213
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:55,450
 here's my list all my nearest neighbors

4214
01:45:52,170 --> 01:45:55,450
 

4215
01:45:52,180 --> 01:45:58,600
 and as you can see as I mouse over these

4216
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:58,600
 

4217
01:45:55,450 --> 01:46:01,360
 nearest neighbors independently of the

4218
01:45:58,590 --> 01:46:01,360
 

4219
01:45:58,600 --> 01:46:05,740
 language all of these nearest neighbors

4220
01:46:01,350 --> 01:46:05,740
 

4221
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:09,100
 are in the same cluster okay so this was

4222
01:46:05,730 --> 01:46:09,100
 

4223
01:46:05,740 --> 01:46:12,130
 huge because this told us that these

4224
01:46:09,090 --> 01:46:12,130
 

4225
01:46:09,100 --> 01:46:14,680
 were the first indications of a

4226
01:46:12,120 --> 01:46:14,680
 

4227
01:46:12,130 --> 01:46:17,530
 universal language of an intern lingua

4228
01:46:14,670 --> 01:46:17,530
 

4229
01:46:14,680 --> 01:46:20,050
 that these systems were actually coming

4230
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:20,050
 

4231
01:46:17,530 --> 01:46:22,930
 up with and this was part of why they

4232
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:22,930
 

4233
01:46:20,050 --> 01:46:25,390
 were able to take take as input multiple

4234
01:46:22,920 --> 01:46:25,390
 

4235
01:46:22,930 --> 01:46:27,820
 languages and output multiple languages

4236
01:46:25,380 --> 01:46:27,820
 

4237
01:46:25,390 --> 01:46:29,500
 so this was this was major right to

4238
01:46:27,810 --> 01:46:29,500
 

4239
01:46:27,820 --> 01:46:32,170
 answer the question that the scientists

4240
01:46:29,490 --> 01:46:32,170
 

4241
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:34,960
 had now keep this image in mind as

4242
01:46:32,160 --> 01:46:34,960
 

4243
01:46:32,170 --> 01:46:36,080
 convoluted as it is and I want to show

4244
01:46:34,950 --> 01:46:36,080
 

4245
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:41,000
 you this

4246
01:46:36,070 --> 01:46:41,000
 

4247
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:46,990
 visualization of a sister system so

4248
01:46:40,990 --> 01:46:46,990
 

4249
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:50,050
 we're gonna go back here and and

4250
01:46:46,980 --> 01:46:50,050
 

4251
01:46:46,990 --> 01:46:53,000
 suspense we're gonna look at this system

4252
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:53,000
 

4253
01:46:50,050 --> 01:46:55,550
 look at this image on the left this is

4254
01:46:52,990 --> 01:46:55,550
 

4255
01:46:53,000 --> 01:47:00,110
 the same visualization of a system that

4256
01:46:55,540 --> 01:47:00,110
 

4257
01:46:55,550 --> 01:47:02,270
 does portuguese english and spanish the

4258
01:47:00,100 --> 01:47:02,270
 

4259
01:47:00,110 --> 01:47:05,090
 difference here is that i have a big

4260
01:47:02,260 --> 01:47:05,090
 

4261
01:47:02,270 --> 01:47:06,620
 chunk of red hanging out by itself we're

4262
01:47:05,080 --> 01:47:06,620
 

4263
01:47:05,090 --> 01:47:08,720
 like what's going on here we thought

4264
01:47:06,610 --> 01:47:08,720
 

4265
01:47:06,620 --> 01:47:11,840
 these things are clustering right so

4266
01:47:08,710 --> 01:47:11,840
 

4267
01:47:08,720 --> 01:47:14,180
 this big chunk of red what we did is we

4268
01:47:11,830 --> 01:47:14,180
 

4269
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:16,690
 downloaded all of those sentences and we

4270
01:47:14,170 --> 01:47:16,690
 

4271
01:47:14,180 --> 01:47:19,430
 ran a statistical analysis visualization

4272
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:19,430
 

4273
01:47:16,690 --> 01:47:21,980
 statistics we ran a statistical analysis

4274
01:47:19,420 --> 01:47:21,980
 

4275
01:47:19,430 --> 01:47:25,120
 of the quality of the translations of

4276
01:47:21,970 --> 01:47:25,120
 

4277
01:47:21,980 --> 01:47:29,090
 these sentences and the quality was bad

4278
01:47:25,110 --> 01:47:29,090
 

4279
01:47:25,120 --> 01:47:31,850
 okay so why does this matter it matters

4280
01:47:29,080 --> 01:47:31,850
 

4281
01:47:29,090 --> 01:47:35,210
 because it tells me that the geometry of

4282
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:35,210
 

4283
01:47:31,850 --> 01:47:38,480
 this space really matters and if your

4284
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:38,480
 

4285
01:47:35,210 --> 01:47:40,460
 system is not being able to do that

4286
01:47:38,470 --> 01:47:40,460
 

4287
01:47:38,480 --> 01:47:43,340
 thing where it clusters these multiple

4288
01:47:40,450 --> 01:47:43,340
 

4289
01:47:40,460 --> 01:47:44,960
 languages semantically it's not working

4290
01:47:43,330 --> 01:47:44,960
 

4291
01:47:43,340 --> 01:47:48,250
 well so you're gonna have to go back and

4292
01:47:44,950 --> 01:47:48,250
 

4293
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:51,320
 debug your system so again this

4294
01:47:48,240 --> 01:47:51,320
 

4295
01:47:48,250 --> 01:47:55,250
 hopefully illustrates one notion of

4296
01:47:51,310 --> 01:47:55,250
 

4297
01:47:51,320 --> 01:47:58,160
 interpretability but also one start for

4298
01:47:55,240 --> 01:47:58,160
 

4299
01:47:55,250 --> 01:48:00,050
 a debug ability very quickly I want to

4300
01:47:58,150 --> 01:48:00,050
 

4301
01:47:58,160 --> 01:48:02,420
 end on one other note that I think is

4302
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:02,420
 

4303
01:48:00,050 --> 01:48:04,100
 important visualization for machine

4304
01:48:02,410 --> 01:48:04,100
 

4305
01:48:02,420 --> 01:48:05,960
 learning in terms of education and

4306
01:48:04,090 --> 01:48:05,960
 

4307
01:48:04,100 --> 01:48:08,750
 communication I'm gonna go very fast

4308
01:48:05,950 --> 01:48:08,750
 

4309
01:48:05,960 --> 01:48:10,970
 here there are two different audiences

4310
01:48:08,740 --> 01:48:10,970
 

4311
01:48:08,750 --> 01:48:13,310
 where you can be really effective with

4312
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:13,310
 

4313
01:48:10,970 --> 01:48:15,710
 visualization from an education

4314
01:48:13,300 --> 01:48:15,710
 

4315
01:48:13,310 --> 01:48:18,680
 perspective one is technical audiences

4316
01:48:15,700 --> 01:48:18,680
 

4317
01:48:15,710 --> 01:48:24,560
 so things like the tensorflow playground

4318
01:48:18,670 --> 01:48:24,560
 

4319
01:48:18,680 --> 01:48:26,320
 a lot of the work on distill but also

4320
01:48:24,550 --> 01:48:26,320
 

4321
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:29,180
 education and communication to

4322
01:48:26,310 --> 01:48:29,180
 

4323
01:48:26,320 --> 01:48:31,370
 non-technical audiences and that matters

4324
01:48:29,170 --> 01:48:31,370
 

4325
01:48:29,180 --> 01:48:33,350
 a ton when we're talking about machine

4326
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:33,350
 

4327
01:48:31,370 --> 01:48:35,660
 learning because there are other

4328
01:48:33,340 --> 01:48:35,660
 

4329
01:48:33,350 --> 01:48:38,810
 stakeholders other than technical people

4330
01:48:35,650 --> 01:48:38,810
 

4331
01:48:35,660 --> 01:48:40,790
 who should be paying attention and

4332
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:40,790
 

4333
01:48:38,810 --> 01:48:42,920
 thinking about machine learning so a

4334
01:48:40,780 --> 01:48:42,920
 

4335
01:48:40,790 --> 01:48:45,410
 couple of examples here this is a

4336
01:48:42,910 --> 01:48:45,410
 

4337
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:48,440
 visualization we did to illustrate some

4338
01:48:45,400 --> 01:48:48,440
 

4339
01:48:45,410 --> 01:48:49,179
 of fairness machine learning fairness

4340
01:48:48,430 --> 01:48:49,179
 

4341
01:48:48,440 --> 01:48:52,130
 trade

4342
01:48:49,169 --> 01:48:52,130
 

4343
01:48:49,179 --> 01:48:53,920
 and so we took a ton of math and we

4344
01:48:52,120 --> 01:48:53,920
 

4345
01:48:52,130 --> 01:48:56,330
 transformed that into an interactive

4346
01:48:53,910 --> 01:48:56,330
 

4347
01:48:53,920 --> 01:49:00,550
 visual simulation that people could play

4348
01:48:56,320 --> 01:49:00,550
 

4349
01:48:56,330 --> 01:49:04,040
 with it turns out policymakers

4350
01:49:00,540 --> 01:49:04,040
 

4351
01:49:00,550 --> 01:49:06,320
 regulators love to look at this because

4352
01:49:04,030 --> 01:49:06,320
 

4353
01:49:04,040 --> 01:49:08,900
 they felt like they were learning they

4354
01:49:06,310 --> 01:49:08,900
 

4355
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:11,960
 were getting to a ton of really concept

4356
01:49:08,890 --> 01:49:11,960
 

4357
01:49:08,900 --> 01:49:14,660
 core mathematical concepts without

4358
01:49:11,950 --> 01:49:14,660
 

4359
01:49:11,960 --> 01:49:17,330
 having to do a PhD but without having

4360
01:49:14,650 --> 01:49:17,330
 

4361
01:49:14,660 --> 01:49:20,330
 the message dumbed down to them for them

4362
01:49:17,320 --> 01:49:20,330
 

4363
01:49:17,330 --> 01:49:22,580
 right so it was it was really really

4364
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:22,580
 

4365
01:49:20,330 --> 01:49:25,100
 good one last thing about quick-draw

4366
01:49:22,570 --> 01:49:25,100
 

4367
01:49:22,580 --> 01:49:27,469
 once this is really cool because it

4368
01:49:25,090 --> 01:49:27,469
 

4369
01:49:25,100 --> 01:49:30,739
 explains how machine learning works for

4370
01:49:27,459 --> 01:49:30,739
 

4371
01:49:27,469 --> 01:49:34,460
 kids so imagine the system asks you to

4372
01:49:30,729 --> 01:49:34,460
 

4373
01:49:30,739 --> 01:49:37,850
 draw an avocado it shows you what it

4374
01:49:34,450 --> 01:49:37,850
 

4375
01:49:34,460 --> 01:49:42,920
 thinks an avocado is by giving you a ton

4376
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:42,920
 

4377
01:49:37,850 --> 01:49:45,140
 of examples of other drawings and this

4378
01:49:42,910 --> 01:49:45,140
 

4379
01:49:42,920 --> 01:49:47,449
 is when it asks you to draw a B you

4380
01:49:45,130 --> 01:49:47,449
 

4381
01:49:45,140 --> 01:49:50,270
 didn't it didn't guess the B but he

4382
01:49:47,439 --> 01:49:50,270
 

4383
01:49:47,449 --> 01:49:53,270
 thought it was either a sea turtle a

4384
01:49:50,260 --> 01:49:53,270
 

4385
01:49:50,270 --> 01:49:56,179
 mouse or a shark so it's showing you its

4386
01:49:53,260 --> 01:49:56,179
 

4387
01:49:53,270 --> 01:49:58,850
 visualizing your output on top of other

4388
01:49:56,169 --> 01:49:58,850
 

4389
01:49:56,179 --> 01:50:00,620
 people's drawings and then it shows you

4390
01:49:58,840 --> 01:50:00,620
 

4391
01:49:58,850 --> 01:50:03,679
 what it thinks about when it thinks

4392
01:50:00,610 --> 01:50:03,679
 

4393
01:50:00,620 --> 01:50:06,730
 about a B okay so really informative

4394
01:50:03,669 --> 01:50:06,730
 

4395
01:50:03,679 --> 01:50:12,080
 without having to be super complicated

4396
01:50:06,720 --> 01:50:12,080
 

4397
01:50:06,730 --> 01:50:14,810
 okay I think yeah so we're going to end

4398
01:50:12,070 --> 01:50:14,810
 

4399
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:16,400
 there I think there are a note to recap

4400
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:16,400
 

4401
01:50:14,810 --> 01:50:17,750
 you know there's a huge amount of

4402
01:50:16,390 --> 01:50:17,750
 

4403
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:19,670
 knowledge already about hub data

4404
01:50:17,740 --> 01:50:19,670
 

4405
01:50:17,750 --> 01:50:21,440
 visualization works you should take

4406
01:50:19,660 --> 01:50:21,440
 

4407
01:50:19,670 --> 01:50:23,330
 advantage of I think when you think

4408
01:50:21,430 --> 01:50:23,330
 

4409
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:25,730
 about high dimensional spaces again this

4410
01:50:23,320 --> 01:50:25,730
 

4411
01:50:23,330 --> 01:50:28,520
 is a very active area understanding the

4412
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:28,520
 

4413
01:50:25,730 --> 01:50:30,170
 issues around you know what random walks

4414
01:50:28,510 --> 01:50:30,170
 

4415
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:34,160
 look like help you interpret those other

4416
01:50:30,160 --> 01:50:34,160
 

4417
01:50:30,170 --> 01:50:36,080
 things there's a lot of directions to go

4418
01:50:34,150 --> 01:50:36,080
 

4419
01:50:34,160 --> 01:50:39,620
 on we wanted to leave you with these

4420
01:50:36,070 --> 01:50:39,620
 

4421
01:50:36,080 --> 01:50:41,420
 resources these are just a few of some

4422
01:50:39,610 --> 01:50:41,420
 

4423
01:50:39,620 --> 01:50:43,580
 of the things that we've looked at for

4424
01:50:41,410 --> 01:50:43,580
 

4425
01:50:41,420 --> 01:50:47,840
 sort of both understanding learning

4426
01:50:43,570 --> 01:50:47,840
 

4427
01:50:43,580 --> 01:50:52,710
 tools and so forth and with that I think

4428
01:50:47,830 --> 01:50:52,710
 

4429
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:55,979
 we will open to questions yeah

4430
01:50:52,700 --> 01:50:55,979
 

4431
01:50:52,710 --> 01:50:55,979
[Applause]

4432
01:51:00,380 --> 01:51:00,380
 

4433
01:51:00,390 --> 01:51:06,450
 are there any questions I think there

4434
01:51:03,120 --> 01:51:06,450
 

4435
01:51:03,130 --> 01:51:06,450
 are two microphones here

4436
01:51:24,750 --> 01:51:24,750
 

4437
01:51:24,760 --> 01:51:26,830
 Oh

4438
01:51:25,120 --> 01:51:26,830
 

4439
01:51:25,130 --> 01:51:29,170
[Music]

4440
01:51:26,820 --> 01:51:29,170
 

4441
01:51:26,830 --> 01:51:32,230
 I have a question a lot of the

4442
01:51:29,160 --> 01:51:32,230
 

4443
01:51:29,170 --> 01:51:34,630
 visualization you show us were images

4444
01:51:32,220 --> 01:51:34,630
 

4445
01:51:32,230 --> 01:51:37,930
 for example have you seen any work on

4446
01:51:34,620 --> 01:51:37,930
 

4447
01:51:34,630 --> 01:51:49,350
 videos to show the temporal also at the

4448
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:49,350
 

4449
01:51:37,930 --> 01:51:53,050
 same time as the special features I

4450
01:51:49,340 --> 01:51:53,050
 

4451
01:51:49,350 --> 01:51:55,300
 think there has been work in the date of

4452
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:55,300
 

4453
01:51:53,050 --> 01:51:57,940
 this world on visualizing videos often

4454
01:51:55,290 --> 01:51:57,940
 

4455
01:51:55,300 --> 01:51:59,680
 historically in the context of say

4456
01:51:57,930 --> 01:51:59,680
 

4457
01:51:57,940 --> 01:52:02,920
 editing a video trying to find your

4458
01:51:59,670 --> 01:52:02,920
 

4459
01:51:59,680 --> 01:52:04,630
 place I honestly don't know if anything

4460
01:52:02,910 --> 01:52:04,630
 

4461
01:52:02,920 --> 01:52:06,220
 that I feel like has solved the problem

4462
01:52:04,620 --> 01:52:06,220
 

4463
01:52:04,630 --> 01:52:08,950
 I think this is actually a great example

4464
01:52:06,210 --> 01:52:08,950
 

4465
01:52:06,220 --> 01:52:11,250
 of an area where there is much much more

4466
01:52:08,940 --> 01:52:11,250
 

4467
01:52:08,950 --> 01:52:17,760
 research needed that you spotlighted yes

4468
01:52:11,240 --> 01:52:17,760
 

4469
01:52:11,250 --> 01:52:20,710
 thank you very much in this slide with

4470
01:52:17,750 --> 01:52:20,710
 

4471
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:22,450
 Spanish English and Portuguese I'm

4472
01:52:20,700 --> 01:52:22,450
 

4473
01:52:20,710 --> 01:52:25,180
 curious you said the training data was

4474
01:52:22,440 --> 01:52:25,180
 

4475
01:52:22,450 --> 01:52:29,290
 bad how did you know it was bad and how

4476
01:52:25,170 --> 01:52:29,290
 

4477
01:52:25,180 --> 01:52:32,320
 did you measure that so we didn't know

4478
01:52:29,280 --> 01:52:32,320
 

4479
01:52:29,290 --> 01:52:36,640
 that the training data was bad what we

4480
01:52:32,310 --> 01:52:36,640
 

4481
01:52:32,320 --> 01:52:40,540
 did know was that afterwards we ran an

4482
01:52:36,630 --> 01:52:40,540
 

4483
01:52:36,640 --> 01:52:42,880
 analysis of the output translations and

4484
01:52:40,530 --> 01:52:42,880
 

4485
01:52:40,540 --> 01:52:45,040
 there is a blue score it's called the

4486
01:52:42,870 --> 01:52:45,040
 

4487
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:47,530
 blue score for those translations and

4488
01:52:45,030 --> 01:52:47,530
 

4489
01:52:45,040 --> 01:52:51,610
 that's what we were looking at and so

4490
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:51,610
 

4491
01:52:47,530 --> 01:52:53,560
 that's what led us to the conclusion

4492
01:52:51,600 --> 01:52:53,560
 

4493
01:52:51,610 --> 01:52:56,590
 that oh wow

4494
01:52:53,550 --> 01:52:56,590
 

4495
01:52:53,560 --> 01:52:59,170
 this whole neighborhood here is is not

4496
01:52:56,580 --> 01:52:59,170
 

4497
01:52:56,590 --> 01:53:03,330
 doing well it was based on this score we

4498
01:52:59,160 --> 01:53:03,330
 

4499
01:52:59,170 --> 01:53:03,330
 had brown thank you

4500
01:53:06,399 --> 01:53:06,399
 

4501
01:53:06,409 --> 01:53:14,389
 thank you for your presentation we can

4502
01:53:10,680 --> 01:53:14,389
 

4503
01:53:10,690 --> 01:53:16,280
 thank you for your presentation I want

4504
01:53:14,379 --> 01:53:16,280
 

4505
01:53:14,389 --> 01:53:18,790
 to know that educational and

4506
01:53:16,270 --> 01:53:18,790
 

4507
01:53:16,280 --> 01:53:21,909
 communication is so important for

4508
01:53:18,780 --> 01:53:21,909
 

4509
01:53:18,790 --> 01:53:25,719
 visualizations how about we make some

4510
01:53:21,899 --> 01:53:25,719
 

4511
01:53:21,909 --> 01:53:28,820
 visualization that motivates people to

4512
01:53:25,709 --> 01:53:28,820
 

4513
01:53:25,719 --> 01:53:32,560
 learn machine learning you know from a

4514
01:53:28,810 --> 01:53:32,560
 

4515
01:53:28,820 --> 01:53:36,050
 very complex problem we just show

4516
01:53:32,550 --> 01:53:36,050
 

4517
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:38,120
 attractive visualization so people that

4518
01:53:36,040 --> 01:53:38,120
 

4519
01:53:36,050 --> 01:53:39,770
 have not enough knowledge in machine

4520
01:53:38,110 --> 01:53:39,770
 

4521
01:53:38,120 --> 01:53:41,659
 learning just I try to learn about

4522
01:53:39,760 --> 01:53:41,659
 

4523
01:53:39,770 --> 01:53:46,159
 machine learning and produce something

4524
01:53:41,649 --> 01:53:46,159
 

4525
01:53:41,659 --> 01:53:47,929
 like that yeah I think that's a great

4526
01:53:46,149 --> 01:53:47,929
 

4527
01:53:46,159 --> 01:53:50,900
 question sort of how you motivate people

4528
01:53:47,919 --> 01:53:50,900
 

4529
01:53:47,929 --> 01:53:53,570
 I think there's actually something from

4530
01:53:50,890 --> 01:53:53,570
 

4531
01:53:50,900 --> 01:53:57,110
 the Google Creative Lab called teachable

4532
01:53:53,560 --> 01:53:57,110
 

4533
01:53:53,570 --> 01:53:59,179
 machine that has I think lets people

4534
01:53:57,100 --> 01:53:59,179
 

4535
01:53:57,110 --> 01:54:01,010
 basically train a machine you know their

4536
01:53:59,169 --> 01:54:01,010
 

4537
01:53:59,179 --> 01:54:03,469
 own laptop to recognize themselves

4538
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,469
 

4539
01:54:01,010 --> 01:54:05,630
 waving or doing something silly and it's

4540
01:54:03,459 --> 01:54:05,630
 

4541
01:54:03,469 --> 01:54:09,230
 done in a very fun way and I think it

4542
01:54:05,620 --> 01:54:09,230
 

4543
01:54:05,630 --> 01:54:11,360
 has exactly that motivational question I

4544
01:54:09,220 --> 01:54:11,360
 

4545
01:54:09,230 --> 01:54:13,100
 think another thing frankly is I think a

4546
01:54:11,350 --> 01:54:13,100
 

4547
01:54:11,360 --> 01:54:15,080
 lot of the work with Ganz has been

4548
01:54:13,090 --> 01:54:15,080
 

4549
01:54:13,100 --> 01:54:16,670
 motivating various communities to learn

4550
01:54:15,070 --> 01:54:16,670
 

4551
01:54:15,080 --> 01:54:18,350
 more about machine learning partly

4552
01:54:16,660 --> 01:54:18,350
 

4553
01:54:16,670 --> 01:54:21,460
 because it seems so mysterious and

4554
01:54:18,340 --> 01:54:21,460
 

4555
01:54:18,350 --> 01:54:24,949
 magical those would be two examples

4556
01:54:21,450 --> 01:54:24,949
 

4557
01:54:21,460 --> 01:54:27,409
 thank you hello

4558
01:54:24,939 --> 01:54:27,409
 

4559
01:54:24,949 --> 01:54:29,480
 so one of the main takeaways from the

4560
01:54:27,399 --> 01:54:29,480
 

4561
01:54:27,409 --> 01:54:31,219
 talk that I got at least was that high

4562
01:54:29,470 --> 01:54:31,219
 

4563
01:54:29,480 --> 01:54:33,440
 dimensional space is really unintuitive

4564
01:54:31,209 --> 01:54:33,440
 

4565
01:54:31,219 --> 01:54:34,880
 to try and visualize do you have any

4566
01:54:33,430 --> 01:54:34,880
 

4567
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:36,800
 recommendations is still like a

4568
01:54:34,870 --> 01:54:36,800
 

4569
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:40,370
 Hitchhiker's Guide to high dimensional

4570
01:54:36,790 --> 01:54:40,370
 

4571
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:42,409
 space yeah I think that is a great idea

4572
01:54:40,360 --> 01:54:42,409
 

4573
01:54:40,370 --> 01:54:45,139
 but often wished something like that

4574
01:54:42,399 --> 01:54:45,139
 

4575
01:54:42,409 --> 01:54:48,889
 existed because it's exactly this

4576
01:54:45,129 --> 01:54:48,889
 

4577
01:54:45,139 --> 01:54:51,409
 question of one of the things I feel

4578
01:54:48,879 --> 01:54:51,409
 

4579
01:54:48,889 --> 01:54:53,900
 like every would be nice if every

4580
01:54:51,399 --> 01:54:53,900
 

4581
01:54:51,409 --> 01:54:55,850
 visualization came with is an example of

4582
01:54:53,890 --> 01:54:55,850
 

4583
01:54:53,900 --> 01:54:58,100
 what it looks like with random data and

4584
01:54:55,840 --> 01:54:58,100
 

4585
01:54:55,850 --> 01:55:00,100
 then you can understand the difference

4586
01:54:58,090 --> 01:55:00,100
 

4587
01:54:58,100 --> 01:55:03,320
 so for example in the papers I showed

4588
01:55:00,090 --> 01:55:03,320
 

4589
01:55:00,100 --> 01:55:05,270
 from Laura and Lee if you go back

4590
01:55:03,310 --> 01:55:05,270
 

4591
01:55:03,320 --> 01:55:07,670
 knowing about random walks what you

4592
01:55:05,260 --> 01:55:07,670
 

4593
01:55:05,270 --> 01:55:09,290
 notice is that those trajectories look a

4594
01:55:07,660 --> 01:55:09,290
 

4595
01:55:07,670 --> 01:55:11,510
 little bit like random blocks but not

4596
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:11,510
 

4597
01:55:09,290 --> 01:55:13,909
 exactly and it completely changes the

4598
01:55:11,500 --> 01:55:13,909
 

4599
01:55:11,510 --> 01:55:14,989
 way that you interpret them you know

4600
01:55:13,899 --> 01:55:14,989
 

4601
01:55:13,909 --> 01:55:16,610
 when you first look at them

4602
01:55:14,979 --> 01:55:16,610
 

4603
01:55:14,989 --> 01:55:18,590
 you're the naive reaction is oh those

4604
01:55:16,600 --> 01:55:18,590
 

4605
01:55:16,610 --> 01:55:19,600
 look like parabolas when you look at

4606
01:55:18,580 --> 01:55:19,600
 

4607
01:55:18,590 --> 01:55:21,550
 them again having

4608
01:55:19,590 --> 01:55:21,550
 

4609
01:55:19,600 --> 01:55:23,620
 releasing your reactions oh wow they're

4610
01:55:21,540 --> 01:55:23,620
 

4611
01:55:21,550 --> 01:55:25,120
 not exactly parabolas and the ways that

4612
01:55:23,610 --> 01:55:25,120
 

4613
01:55:23,620 --> 01:55:27,790
 they're different are really informative

4614
01:55:25,110 --> 01:55:27,790
 

4615
01:55:25,120 --> 01:55:29,710
 so I yeah I strongly believe there

4616
01:55:27,780 --> 01:55:29,710
 

4617
01:55:27,790 --> 01:55:31,960
 should be sort of a textbook of the

4618
01:55:29,700 --> 01:55:31,960
 

4619
01:55:29,710 --> 01:55:34,630
 peculiarities of high dimensional space

4620
01:55:31,950 --> 01:55:34,630
 

4621
01:55:31,960 --> 01:55:37,270
 yeah I see but you don't know of any

4622
01:55:34,620 --> 01:55:37,270
 

4623
01:55:34,630 --> 01:55:38,680
 like sort of cohesive resources for

4624
01:55:37,260 --> 01:55:38,680
 

4625
01:55:37,270 --> 01:55:40,570
 something I don't there's sort of some

4626
01:55:38,670 --> 01:55:40,570
 

4627
01:55:38,680 --> 01:55:42,220
 interesting YouTube videos if you look

4628
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:42,220
 

4629
01:55:40,570 --> 01:55:44,770
 up high dimensional space but you know

4630
01:55:42,210 --> 01:55:44,770
 

4631
01:55:42,220 --> 01:55:46,660
 and and certainly I'm trying to think if

4632
01:55:44,760 --> 01:55:46,660
 

4633
01:55:44,770 --> 01:55:49,570
 there's any single one that I recommend

4634
01:55:46,650 --> 01:55:49,570
 

4635
01:55:46,660 --> 01:55:59,200
 yeah but I someone to do that for sure

4636
01:55:49,560 --> 01:55:59,200
 

4637
01:55:49,570 --> 01:56:01,690
 awesome thank you so early techniques

4638
01:55:59,190 --> 01:56:01,690
 

4639
01:55:59,200 --> 01:56:03,520
 for high dimensional spatial and

4640
01:56:01,680 --> 01:56:03,520
 

4641
01:56:01,690 --> 01:56:05,470
 temporal data sets so if you have

4642
01:56:03,510 --> 01:56:05,470
 

4643
01:56:03,520 --> 01:56:09,670
 something like a something waiting on a

4644
01:56:05,460 --> 01:56:09,670
 

4645
01:56:05,470 --> 01:56:11,530
 map or a time for high dimension data

4646
01:56:09,660 --> 01:56:11,530
 

4647
01:56:09,670 --> 01:56:14,170
 that's right is there something you can

4648
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:14,170
 

4649
01:56:11,530 --> 01:56:19,240
 visualize that embedding space for

4650
01:56:14,160 --> 01:56:19,240
 

4651
01:56:14,170 --> 01:56:21,580
 spatial and temporal variations by a

4652
01:56:19,230 --> 01:56:21,580
 

4653
01:56:19,240 --> 01:56:23,890
 Matar can you repeat that last part so

4654
01:56:21,570 --> 01:56:23,890
 

4655
01:56:21,580 --> 01:56:26,770
 you have a TS any type embedding space

4656
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:26,770
 

4657
01:56:23,890 --> 01:56:30,580
 right that's for a sentence so if you

4658
01:56:26,760 --> 01:56:30,580
 

4659
01:56:26,770 --> 01:56:32,290
 have something varying and also in times

4660
01:56:30,570 --> 01:56:32,290
 

4661
01:56:30,580 --> 01:56:35,470
 let's say I want to visualize multiple

4662
01:56:32,280 --> 01:56:35,470
 

4663
01:56:32,290 --> 01:56:36,970
 sentences that's the same sentence spoke

4664
01:56:35,460 --> 01:56:36,970
 

4665
01:56:35,470 --> 01:56:41,980
 in different languages or a time right

4666
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:41,980
 

4667
01:56:36,970 --> 01:56:43,690
 sort of a time varying yeah so there is

4668
01:56:41,970 --> 01:56:43,690
 

4669
01:56:41,980 --> 01:56:45,400
 a thing that you can do in the embedding

4670
01:56:43,680 --> 01:56:45,400
 

4671
01:56:43,690 --> 01:56:48,070
 projector that we showed that lets you

4672
01:56:45,390 --> 01:56:48,070
 

4673
01:56:45,400 --> 01:56:51,550
 at least visualize trajectories through

4674
01:56:48,060 --> 01:56:51,550
 

4675
01:56:48,070 --> 01:56:55,630
 space I think it is very tricky it's

4676
01:56:51,540 --> 01:56:55,630
 

4677
01:56:51,550 --> 01:56:57,220
 hard to make sense of sometimes I think

4678
01:56:55,620 --> 01:56:57,220
 

4679
01:56:55,630 --> 01:56:59,080
 this is also a case where small

4680
01:56:57,210 --> 01:56:59,080
 

4681
01:56:57,220 --> 01:57:01,960
 multiples are very good so there is a

4682
01:56:59,070 --> 01:57:01,960
 

4683
01:56:59,080 --> 01:57:04,210
 paper out of Stanford showing how word

4684
01:57:01,950 --> 01:57:04,210
 

4685
01:57:01,960 --> 01:57:06,310
 embeddings change over time as you look

4686
01:57:04,200 --> 01:57:06,310
 

4687
01:57:04,210 --> 01:57:07,960
 at say books from different decades and

4688
01:57:06,300 --> 01:57:07,960
 

4689
01:57:06,310 --> 01:57:10,300
 they're I believe they use small

4690
01:57:07,950 --> 01:57:10,300
 

4691
01:57:07,960 --> 01:57:12,520
 multiples I don't know if a solution

4692
01:57:10,290 --> 01:57:12,520
 

4693
01:57:10,300 --> 01:57:14,560
 more sophisticated than that but I would

4694
01:57:12,510 --> 01:57:14,560
 

4695
01:57:12,520 --> 01:57:15,880
 say that's another great area yeah

4696
01:57:14,550 --> 01:57:15,880
 

4697
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:17,860
 that's what I was going to say that's a

4698
01:57:15,870 --> 01:57:17,860
 

4699
01:57:15,880 --> 01:57:19,750
 great area if you want to if you're

4700
01:57:17,850 --> 01:57:19,750
 

4701
01:57:17,860 --> 01:57:20,980
 interested in working with visualization

4702
01:57:19,740 --> 01:57:20,980
 

4703
01:57:19,750 --> 01:57:24,190
 coming up with the visualization

4704
01:57:20,970 --> 01:57:24,190
 

4705
01:57:20,980 --> 01:57:25,369
 technique that allows you to compare two

4706
01:57:24,180 --> 01:57:25,369
 

4707
01:57:24,190 --> 01:57:29,300
 or three different

4708
01:57:25,359 --> 01:57:29,300
 

4709
01:57:25,369 --> 01:57:30,889
 airings so highly me I work on the

4710
01:57:29,290 --> 01:57:30,889
 

4711
01:57:29,300 --> 01:57:32,570
 physics data set so it is spatial and

4712
01:57:30,879 --> 01:57:32,570
 

4713
01:57:30,889 --> 01:57:36,079
 temporal variation that's was curious

4714
01:57:32,560 --> 01:57:36,079
 

4715
01:57:32,570 --> 01:57:38,209
 about on I work on physics datasets with

4716
01:57:36,069 --> 01:57:38,209
 

4717
01:57:36,079 --> 01:57:42,039
 spatial and temporal variation that was

4718
01:57:38,199 --> 01:57:42,039
 

4719
01:57:38,209 --> 01:57:42,039
 curious about the topic right thank you

4720
01:57:42,389 --> 01:57:42,389
 

4721
01:57:42,399 --> 01:57:47,809
 thanks for the talk very nicely the

4722
01:57:45,819 --> 01:57:47,809
 

4723
01:57:45,829 --> 01:57:50,510
 influence of the hyper parameter for

4724
01:57:47,799 --> 01:57:50,510
 

4725
01:57:47,809 --> 01:57:53,629
 t-sne you've shown the hyper parameter

4726
01:57:50,500 --> 01:57:53,629
 

4727
01:57:50,510 --> 01:57:56,329
 influence for t-sne and the perplexity

4728
01:57:53,619 --> 01:57:56,329
 

4729
01:57:53,629 --> 01:57:58,820
 it's a good rule of thumb to say that if

4730
01:57:56,319 --> 01:57:58,820
 

4731
01:57:56,329 --> 01:58:00,379
 you don't see any clusters for any value

4732
01:57:58,810 --> 01:58:00,379
 

4733
01:57:58,820 --> 01:58:02,209
 to say there is no cluster

4734
01:58:00,369 --> 01:58:02,209
 

4735
01:58:00,379 --> 01:58:05,749
 I mean you've drawn that conclusion at

4736
01:58:02,199 --> 01:58:05,749
 

4737
01:58:02,209 --> 01:58:08,090
 one point you're saying if you don't is

4738
01:58:05,739 --> 01:58:08,090
 

4739
01:58:05,749 --> 01:58:10,669
 it a good rule of thumb to say that if

4740
01:58:08,080 --> 01:58:10,669
 

4741
01:58:08,090 --> 01:58:14,030
 you don't see any clusters for any

4742
01:58:10,659 --> 01:58:14,030
 

4743
01:58:10,669 --> 01:58:19,099
 values then it's is it safe to say there

4744
01:58:14,020 --> 01:58:19,099
 

4745
01:58:14,030 --> 01:58:22,249
 are no clusters is that the question my

4746
01:58:19,089 --> 01:58:22,249
 

4747
01:58:19,099 --> 01:58:24,709
 guess is you could probably construct a

4748
01:58:22,239 --> 01:58:24,709
 

4749
01:58:22,249 --> 01:58:27,769
 very weird data set that did have some

4750
01:58:24,699 --> 01:58:27,769
 

4751
01:58:24,709 --> 01:58:29,989
 cluster that would not show up but that

4752
01:58:27,759 --> 01:58:29,989
 

4753
01:58:27,769 --> 01:58:33,320
 is a good question I think in practice

4754
01:58:29,979 --> 01:58:33,320
 

4755
01:58:29,989 --> 01:58:37,159
 I'd have to say another issue with TC is

4756
01:58:33,310 --> 01:58:37,159
 

4757
01:58:33,320 --> 01:58:39,050
 that it can make random data look

4758
01:58:37,149 --> 01:58:39,050
 

4759
01:58:37,159 --> 01:58:41,629
 non-random at times if you're not

4760
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:41,629
 

4761
01:58:39,050 --> 01:58:43,849
 careful and so often it feels like it's

4762
01:58:41,619 --> 01:58:43,849
 

4763
01:58:41,629 --> 01:58:45,949
 a the issue is much more about false

4764
01:58:43,839 --> 01:58:45,949
 

4765
01:58:43,849 --> 01:58:47,719
 positives and false negatives in a sense

4766
01:58:45,939 --> 01:58:47,719
 

4767
01:58:45,949 --> 01:58:51,229
 when you're looking for clusters in my

4768
01:58:47,709 --> 01:58:51,229
 

4769
01:58:47,719 --> 01:58:54,739
 experience and and the other thing to to

4770
01:58:51,219 --> 01:58:54,739
 

4771
01:58:51,229 --> 01:58:56,659
 think about is it's always nice to kind

4772
01:58:54,729 --> 01:58:56,659
 

4773
01:58:54,739 --> 01:58:59,030
 of sanity check you're not gonna get

4774
01:58:56,649 --> 01:58:59,030
 

4775
01:58:56,659 --> 01:59:00,889
 like the perfect answer but to sanity

4776
01:58:59,020 --> 01:59:00,889
 

4777
01:58:59,030 --> 01:59:04,039
 check with other projection techniques

4778
01:59:00,879 --> 01:59:04,039
 

4779
01:59:00,889 --> 01:59:05,869
 right so for instance in the in the

4780
01:59:04,029 --> 01:59:05,869
 

4781
01:59:04,039 --> 01:59:07,969
 embedding projector for instance it

4782
01:59:05,859 --> 01:59:07,969
 

4783
01:59:05,869 --> 01:59:10,519
 comes with two projection techniques so

4784
01:59:07,959 --> 01:59:10,519
 

4785
01:59:07,969 --> 01:59:12,679
 one is linear PCA the other is T Snee

4786
01:59:10,509 --> 01:59:12,679
 

4787
01:59:10,519 --> 01:59:16,129
 we're hoping that soon we're gonna have

4788
01:59:12,669 --> 01:59:16,129
 

4789
01:59:12,679 --> 01:59:19,519
 you map but basically the more you turn

4790
01:59:16,119 --> 01:59:19,519
 

4791
01:59:16,129 --> 01:59:22,639
 and look at these things and try to you

4792
01:59:19,509 --> 01:59:22,639
 

4793
01:59:19,519 --> 01:59:24,940
 know just try out a bunch of stuff the

4794
01:59:22,629 --> 01:59:24,940
 

4795
01:59:22,639 --> 01:59:30,810
 better but you're right there's no like

4796
01:59:24,930 --> 01:59:30,810
 

4797
01:59:24,940 --> 01:59:30,810
 now I'm 100% sure all right thank you

4798
01:59:31,340 --> 01:59:31,340
 

4799
01:59:31,350 --> 01:59:36,550
 thanks for a great talk

4800
01:59:33,780 --> 01:59:36,550
 

4801
01:59:33,790 --> 01:59:39,670
 one question it's a possible to share

4802
01:59:36,540 --> 01:59:39,670
 

4803
01:59:36,550 --> 01:59:42,489
 the slides yeah we'll try to share

4804
01:59:39,660 --> 01:59:42,489
 

4805
01:59:39,670 --> 01:59:43,120
 something as much as we can yeah we will

4806
01:59:42,479 --> 01:59:43,120
 

4807
01:59:42,489 --> 01:59:45,400
 we will

4808
01:59:43,110 --> 01:59:45,400
 

4809
01:59:43,120 --> 01:59:52,210
 yeah we'll figure out what is the best

4810
01:59:45,390 --> 01:59:52,210
 

4811
01:59:45,400 --> 01:59:53,680
 way yes hi I was a very nice talk so I

4812
01:59:52,200 --> 01:59:53,680
 

4813
01:59:52,210 --> 01:59:56,590
 have a data set I'm trying to visualize

4814
01:59:53,670 --> 01:59:56,590
 

4815
01:59:53,680 --> 01:59:58,630
 which is spatial and temporal and I was

4816
01:59:56,580 --> 01:59:58,630
 

4817
01:59:56,590 --> 02:00:00,760
 thinking of going with an animation for

4818
01:59:58,620 --> 02:00:00,760
 

4819
01:59:58,630 --> 02:00:02,410
 the time dimension would you advise

4820
02:00:00,750 --> 02:00:02,410
 

4821
02:00:00,760 --> 02:00:04,090
 against that because I didn't see you

4822
02:00:02,400 --> 02:00:04,090
 

4823
02:00:02,410 --> 02:00:07,090
 doing that in any of the visualizations

4824
02:00:04,080 --> 02:00:07,090
 

4825
02:00:04,090 --> 02:00:09,670
 I would say it depends on your purpose I

4826
02:00:07,080 --> 02:00:09,670
 

4827
02:00:07,090 --> 02:00:13,390
 think for exploratory analysis animation

4828
02:00:09,660 --> 02:00:13,390
 

4829
02:00:09,670 --> 02:00:16,090
 is actually often kind of problematic on

4830
02:00:13,380 --> 02:00:16,090
 

4831
02:00:13,390 --> 02:00:18,460
 the other hand if you're going to use it

4832
02:00:16,080 --> 02:00:18,460
 

4833
02:00:16,090 --> 02:00:20,380
 to explain your ideas or try to get

4834
02:00:18,450 --> 02:00:20,380
 

4835
02:00:18,460 --> 02:00:24,310
 funding from someone that animation is

4836
02:00:20,370 --> 02:00:24,310
 

4837
02:00:20,380 --> 02:00:28,660
 excellent for that that is the that is

4838
02:00:24,300 --> 02:00:28,660
 

4839
02:00:24,310 --> 02:00:30,489
 my most practical advice but also you

4840
02:00:28,650 --> 02:00:30,489
 

4841
02:00:28,660 --> 02:00:32,860
 could you could give it a try right you

4842
02:00:30,479 --> 02:00:32,860
 

4843
02:00:30,489 --> 02:00:34,239
 could do something with animation but

4844
02:00:32,850 --> 02:00:34,239
 

4845
02:00:32,860 --> 02:00:36,400
 then you can also take a bunch of

4846
02:00:34,229 --> 02:00:36,400
 

4847
02:00:34,239 --> 02:00:39,460
 screenshots and do small multiples and

4848
02:00:36,390 --> 02:00:39,460
 

4849
02:00:36,400 --> 02:00:41,650
 depending on your analytical tasks what

4850
02:00:39,450 --> 02:00:41,650
 

4851
02:00:39,460 --> 02:00:43,420
 it is you're trying to get it you can

4852
02:00:41,640 --> 02:00:43,420
 

4853
02:00:41,650 --> 02:00:46,030
 decide which one do you think is the

4854
02:00:43,410 --> 02:00:46,030
 

4855
02:00:43,420 --> 02:00:47,650
 most effective if you think about one of

4856
02:00:46,020 --> 02:00:47,650
 

4857
02:00:46,030 --> 02:00:49,690
 the ones we showed from the New York

4858
02:00:47,640 --> 02:00:49,690
 

4859
02:00:47,650 --> 02:00:52,600
 Times where they were trying to show

4860
02:00:49,680 --> 02:00:52,600
 

4861
02:00:49,690 --> 02:00:54,490
 droughts over time it was quite

4862
02:00:52,590 --> 02:00:54,490
 

4863
02:00:52,600 --> 02:00:57,700
 effective to have

4864
02:00:54,480 --> 02:00:57,700
 

4865
02:00:54,490 --> 02:01:04,690
 all of those things at the same time on

4866
02:00:57,690 --> 02:01:04,690
 

4867
02:00:57,700 --> 02:01:07,750
 on the screen thank you okay thank you

4868
02:01:04,680 --> 02:01:07,750
 

4869
02:01:04,690 --> 02:01:11,320
 for your presentation and you show that

4870
02:01:07,740 --> 02:01:11,320
 

4871
02:01:07,750 --> 02:01:13,000
 your work ranks border glossary squad

4872
02:01:11,310 --> 02:01:13,000
 

4873
02:01:11,320 --> 02:01:16,330
 mix right

4874
02:01:12,990 --> 02:01:16,330
 

4875
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:18,370
 but in my intuition there must be some

4876
02:01:16,320 --> 02:01:18,370
 

4877
02:01:16,330 --> 02:01:21,370
 similarity and dissimilarity between two

4878
02:01:18,360 --> 02:01:21,370
 

4879
02:01:18,370 --> 02:01:24,460
 languages so it can be interpreted in

4880
02:01:21,360 --> 02:01:24,460
 

4881
02:01:21,370 --> 02:01:28,240
 your visualization or my intuition is

4882
02:01:24,450 --> 02:01:28,240
 

4883
02:01:24,460 --> 02:01:31,090
 biased so let me make sure I understand

4884
02:01:28,230 --> 02:01:31,090
 

4885
02:01:28,240 --> 02:01:36,460
 is your intuition that the languages are

4886
02:01:31,080 --> 02:01:36,460
 

4887
02:01:31,090 --> 02:01:38,560
 similar some so my intuition is like

4888
02:01:36,450 --> 02:01:38,560
 

4889
02:01:36,460 --> 02:01:41,680
 this and Korean and Japanese is quite

4890
02:01:38,550 --> 02:01:41,680
 

4891
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:43,900
 similar than Korean and English so can

4892
02:01:41,670 --> 02:01:43,900
 

4893
02:01:41,680 --> 02:01:48,130
 it be interpreted in their visualization

4894
02:01:43,890 --> 02:01:48,130
 

4895
02:01:43,900 --> 02:01:49,990
 so without being a native speaker I had

4896
02:01:48,120 --> 02:01:49,990
 

4897
02:01:48,130 --> 02:01:52,990
 no idea I thought that Japanese and

4898
02:01:49,980 --> 02:01:52,990
 

4899
02:01:49,990 --> 02:01:55,480
 Korean was quite similar I am told from

4900
02:01:52,980 --> 02:01:55,480
 

4901
02:01:52,990 --> 02:01:58,770
 other people who speak Japanese or

4902
02:01:55,470 --> 02:01:58,770
 

4903
02:01:55,480 --> 02:02:02,620
 Korean that they are quite different but

4904
02:01:58,760 --> 02:02:02,620
 

4905
02:01:58,770 --> 02:02:06,400
 even keeping that aside for a moment

4906
02:02:02,610 --> 02:02:06,400
 

4907
02:02:02,620 --> 02:02:08,740
 I'm a native Portuguese speaker and so

4908
02:02:06,390 --> 02:02:08,740
 

4909
02:02:06,400 --> 02:02:11,920
 when I looked at that system that had

4910
02:02:08,730 --> 02:02:11,920
 

4911
02:02:08,740 --> 02:02:14,050
 English Portuguese and Spanish to me it

4912
02:02:11,910 --> 02:02:14,050
 

4913
02:02:11,920 --> 02:02:16,000
 was very clear that those things should

4914
02:02:14,040 --> 02:02:16,000
 

4915
02:02:14,050 --> 02:02:19,000
 have clustered because because

4916
02:02:15,990 --> 02:02:19,000
 

4917
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:21,580
 Portuguese and Spanish are really close

4918
02:02:18,990 --> 02:02:21,580
 

4919
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:24,940
 I'm like this is gonna be so easy and it

4920
02:02:21,570 --> 02:02:24,940
 

4921
02:02:21,580 --> 02:02:26,770
 was not it did not cluster right so that

4922
02:02:24,930 --> 02:02:26,770
 

4923
02:02:24,940 --> 02:02:30,040
 to me was the point where I was like

4924
02:02:26,760 --> 02:02:30,040
 

4925
02:02:26,770 --> 02:02:31,630
 whoa what's going on here so even you

4926
02:02:30,030 --> 02:02:31,630
 

4927
02:02:30,040 --> 02:02:34,060
 know languages that should be quite

4928
02:02:31,620 --> 02:02:34,060
 

4929
02:02:31,630 --> 02:02:36,850
 similar are not necessarily clustering

4930
02:02:34,050 --> 02:02:36,850
 

4931
02:02:34,060 --> 02:02:40,390
 so I think that's where I was like oh

4932
02:02:36,840 --> 02:02:40,390
 

4933
02:02:36,850 --> 02:02:43,840
 this is very complicated it's not always

4934
02:02:40,380 --> 02:02:43,840
 

4935
02:02:40,390 --> 02:02:46,080
 about similarity thank you one more

4936
02:02:43,830 --> 02:02:46,080
 

4937
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:46,080
 question

4938
02:02:46,780 --> 02:02:46,780
 

4939
02:02:46,790 --> 02:02:52,760
 it's on sorry thanks for your great

4940
02:02:49,970 --> 02:02:52,760
 

4941
02:02:49,980 --> 02:02:57,480
 sharing I have a very practical question

4942
02:02:52,750 --> 02:02:57,480
 

4943
02:02:52,760 --> 02:03:00,750
 normally how long it takes to forget to

4944
02:02:57,470 --> 02:03:00,750
 

4945
02:02:57,480 --> 02:03:02,970
 get a conclusion and what's the typical

4946
02:03:00,740 --> 02:03:02,970
 

4947
02:03:00,750 --> 02:03:08,400
 flow when you have a research question

4948
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:08,400
 

4949
02:03:02,970 --> 02:03:10,950
 in Google brain can you repeat the

4950
02:03:08,390 --> 02:03:10,950
 

4951
02:03:08,400 --> 02:03:13,800
 question yeah basically it's very

4952
02:03:10,940 --> 02:03:13,800
 

4953
02:03:10,950 --> 02:03:15,900
 practical what's the best typical flow

4954
02:03:13,790 --> 02:03:15,900
 

4955
02:03:13,800 --> 02:03:18,270
 in Google brain when you have a research

4956
02:03:15,890 --> 02:03:18,270
 

4957
02:03:15,900 --> 02:03:21,239
 question and how long does it take her

4958
02:03:18,260 --> 02:03:21,239
 

4959
02:03:18,270 --> 02:03:24,810
 to get a conclusion for you original how

4960
02:03:21,229 --> 02:03:24,810
 

4961
02:03:21,239 --> 02:03:26,280
 long does a project last from the it's

4962
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:26,280
 

4963
02:03:24,810 --> 02:03:30,300
 impossible to give an answer to that

4964
02:03:26,270 --> 02:03:30,300
 

4965
02:03:26,280 --> 02:03:31,350
 because I think it's it is there's so

4966
02:03:30,290 --> 02:03:31,350
 

4967
02:03:30,300 --> 02:03:33,300
 many people doing so many different

4968
02:03:31,340 --> 02:03:33,300
 

4969
02:03:31,350 --> 02:03:35,160
 things that I think sometimes there are

4970
02:03:33,290 --> 02:03:35,160
 

4971
02:03:33,300 --> 02:03:37,350
 very quick experiments people do there's

4972
02:03:35,150 --> 02:03:37,350
 

4973
02:03:35,160 --> 02:03:38,370
 other things that take years I think to

4974
02:03:37,340 --> 02:03:38,370
 

4975
02:03:37,350 --> 02:03:41,040
 me actually that's one of the pleasures

4976
02:03:38,360 --> 02:03:41,040
 

4977
02:03:38,370 --> 02:03:43,230
 of it is that things do happen at all

4978
02:03:41,030 --> 02:03:43,230
 

4979
02:03:41,040 --> 02:03:47,100
 different scales and I think that's

4980
02:03:43,220 --> 02:03:47,100
 

4981
02:03:43,230 --> 02:03:53,070
 actually very exciting last question

4982
02:03:47,090 --> 02:03:53,070
 

4983
02:03:47,100 --> 02:03:54,630
 last question so I thought it was a

4984
02:03:53,060 --> 02:03:54,630
 

4985
02:03:53,070 --> 02:03:56,130
 really great job especially the first

4986
02:03:54,620 --> 02:03:56,130
 

4987
02:03:54,630 --> 02:03:58,560
 part I hadn't thought of that the

4988
02:03:56,120 --> 02:03:58,560
 

4989
02:03:56,130 --> 02:04:00,270
 psychology but in my lab we developed

4990
02:03:58,550 --> 02:04:00,270
 

4991
02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:03,600
 visualization algorithms and I just

4992
02:04:00,260 --> 02:04:03,600
 

4993
02:04:00,270 --> 02:04:05,220
 wanted to point out hey you guys didn't

4994
02:04:03,590 --> 02:04:05,220
 

4995
02:04:03,600 --> 02:04:06,780
 really cover diffusion maps which are

4996
02:04:05,210 --> 02:04:06,780
 

4997
02:04:05,220 --> 02:04:09,090
 really good for trajectories and things

4998
02:04:06,770 --> 02:04:09,090
 

4999
02:04:06,780 --> 02:04:12,270
 like that which are cool B we have a

5000
02:04:09,080 --> 02:04:12,270
 

5001
02:04:09,090 --> 02:04:14,070
 method called Fate PHA EE and we feel

5002
02:04:12,260 --> 02:04:14,070
 

5003
02:04:12,270 --> 02:04:15,420
 like it's much much better than you map

5004
02:04:14,060 --> 02:04:15,420
 

5005
02:04:14,070 --> 02:04:18,330
 at capturing global and local

5006
02:04:15,410 --> 02:04:18,330
 

5007
02:04:15,420 --> 02:04:23,300
 information please check it out and it's

5008
02:04:18,320 --> 02:04:23,300
 

5009
02:04:18,330 --> 02:04:23,300
 faster than you met awesome thank you
