113
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:41,130
 and I will present a tutorial on your

114
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:41,130
 

115
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:44,370
 approach to conditionally I this

116
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,370
 

117
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:46,530
 tutorial based on a recent book of the

118
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,530
 

119
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:51,630
 same title written by us and leave only

120
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:51,630
 

121
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:54,540
 from Google ai you can click the link to

122
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,540
 

123
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:58,500
 get the paper but unfortunately paper is

124
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:58,500
 

125
00:09:54,540 --> 00:10:01,920
 not free you need to pay about $99 it's

126
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:01,920
 

127
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:05,900
 very very expensive okay $99 but we also

128
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:05,900
 

129
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:09,900
 put a draft but it's a very rough draft

130
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:09,900
 

131
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:13,860
 care so you can get our care paper for

132
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:13,860
 

133
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:17,280
 free but we will keep updating the our

134
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:17,280
 

135
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:19,860
 care paper Punk for example right after

136
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,860
 

137
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:22,320
 this conference after I we collect

138
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:22,320
 

139
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:24,210
 feedbacks from all of you so in some

140
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,210
 

141
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,000
 sense that I care paper is even better

142
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,000
 

143
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:29,820
 than the book but the publisher say I

144
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:29,820
 

145
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,420
 need to mention the book first okay so

146
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:30,420
 

147
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:34,020
 by the book

148
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:34,020
 

149
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:36,780
 if we have money or free download okay

150
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,780
 

151
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:39,830
 paper then we will also put a thrice

152
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,830
 

153
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:43,970
 annoy tradition after the conference

154
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:43,970
 

155
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:47,700
 there will be four parts of the talk

156
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,700
 

157
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:50,370
 after a very brief introduction to this

158
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:50,370
 

159
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:54,420
 tutorial and what kind of problems were

160
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,420
 

161
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:59,460
 dealing with when building this neural

162
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:59,460
 

163
00:10:54,420 --> 00:11:01,500
 dialogue systems our present in unifying

164
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,500
 

165
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:05,370
 the view which we formulate dialogue as

166
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:05,370
 

167
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:08,760
 an optimal decision making process then

168
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,760
 

169
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:11,490
 talk a little about the deepening recent

170
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,490
 

171
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:14,400
 progress of deep learning where the deep

172
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,400
 

173
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:17,670
 learning is to the paradigm shift in

174
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:17,670
 

175
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:21,410
 natural language processing now we will

176
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:21,410
 

177
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:24,030
 spend the rest of three parts describing

178
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,030
 

179
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:26,150
 three types of dialogue systems

180
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,150
 

181
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:29,730
 including the question answering system

182
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:29,730
 

183
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:33,900
 task oriented at idle systems and the

184
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,900
 

185
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:35,940
 social Chabad systems who should attend

186
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,940
 

187
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,090
 these tutorials in all of you are in

 whoever wants to understand and create a

192
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:43,120
 

193
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:46,030

203
00:11:53,620 --> 00:12:01,720
 all the solutions and just give you some

204
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,720
 

205
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:04,750
 recent survey of the recent progress Hey

206
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:04,750
 

207
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:08,470
 although the focus of this talk is a

208
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,470
 

209
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:11,500
 newer approach keep in mind the hybrid

210
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,500
 

211
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:13,780
 approach which combines the strengths of

212
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,780
 

213
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:16,480
 traditional approach including

214
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:16,480
 

215
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:19,660
 rule-based systems and the new approach

216
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:19,660
 

217
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:22,330
 are still widely used in the community

218
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:22,330
 

219
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:27,600
 and especially in industry I'll give you

220
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,600
 

221
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:31,870
 two examples so let's start with example

222
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:31,870
 

223
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:36,450
 here is a dialogue during the process of

224
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:36,450
 

225
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:38,620
 making a business decision okay

226
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,620
 

227
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:42,580
 someone in our company asked the

228
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:42,580
 

229
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:43,930
 question like where sales lagging behind

230
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:43,930
 

231
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:47,170
 our forecast

232
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,170
 

233
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:49,870
 then when another VP reprise it the

234
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,870
 

235
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:53,100
 worst case was reading in this country

236
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:53,100
 

237
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:56,730
 where sales are this much below

238
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:56,730
 

239
00:12:53,100 --> 00:13:00,130
 predictions and do you know why see the

240
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,130
 

241
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:03,250
 forecast for this prior growth was

242
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,250
 

243
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:06,310
 overly optimistic how can we do this

244
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,310
 

245
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:08,230
 wrong okay here are the 10 customers in

246
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,230
 

247
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:11,380
 this country with the most growth

248
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,380
 

249
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:12,820
 potential per hour CNN model I can't set

250
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,820
 

251
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:15,790
 up a meeting with the CEO of this

252
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:15,790
 

253
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:16,110
 company yes I said a meeting with this

254
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,110
 

255
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:19,030
 guy

256
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,030
 

257
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:22,420
 finesse means when you are in this place

258
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:22,420
 

259
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:25,270
 okay thank you now this example

260
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:25,270
 

261
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:29,170
 illustrates the kinds of problems a

262
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:29,170
 

263
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:31,300
 dialogue system is expected so okay go

264
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,300
 

265
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:34,890
 to the next slide you will see what kind

266
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:34,890
 

267
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:38,620
 of problem was so here first of all it's

268
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,620
 

269
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:43,900
 the title agent needs to talk like a

270
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:43,900
 

271
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:46,480
 human being this is one of the longest

272
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,480
 

273
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:49,600
 running NGO in AI right we want to build

274
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:49,600
 

275
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,700
 an aging which can talk like a human you

276
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:50,700
 

277
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,630
 know to pass the zoo

278
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:53,630
 

279
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:56,970
 for Turing tests but this not enough

280
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,970
 

281
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:59,580
 most importantly we want aging to

282
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,580
 

283
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:02,780
 accomplish concrete tasks including ask

284
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:02,780
 

285
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:05,550
 answer questions need to care since

286
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:05,550
 

287
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:08,390
 trample the aging need to be able to

288
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:08,390
 

289
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:11,010
 scale your meeting for you and

290
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,010
 

291
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:13,370
 ultimately help you to make business

292
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,370
 

293
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:13,370
 decisions

294
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:14,290
 

295
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:21,210
 typically we group the Tyrell departs

296
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:21,210
 

297
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:23,310
 into two different categories called a

298
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,310
 

299
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:25,800
 win is called ChaCha the other card is

300
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,800
 

301
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:29,670
 it the other is card to oranjee the

302
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:29,670
 

303
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:33,750
 dialogues depending on whether the

304
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,750
 

305
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:39,140
 dialogue is conducted to assist users to

306
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:39,140
 

307
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:41,310
 achieve a very specific task including

308
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:41,310
 

309
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:46,740
 answering questions schedule a meeting

310
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:46,740
 

311
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:49,860
 making a decision and the traditionally

312
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:49,860
 

313
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:51,840
 most of the goal-oriented bones such as

314
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,840
 

315
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:54,300
 the question answer involves task

316
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:54,300
 

317
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:57,480
 oriented boards and decision-making bots

318
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:57,480
 

319
00:14:54,300 --> 00:15:00,530
 are implemented using a modular system

320
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:00,530
 

321
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:02,910
 consists of these four components

322
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,910
 

323
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:05,250
 natural language understanding which

324
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,250
 

325
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:08,090
 will commit using what inclusive a

326
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,090
 

327
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:12,440
 cemented to frame representation which

328
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:12,440
 

329
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:15,380
 identify users intent request then

330
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:15,380
 

331
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:19,920
 second module is called a state tracker

332
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:19,920
 

333
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:22,080
 which keep tracking the state of the

334
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,080
 

335
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,210
 conversation so what the aging already

336
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:24,210
 

337
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:27,480
 know what the user already said what we

338
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,480
 

339
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:31,260
 need to know more in order to accomplish

340
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:31,260
 

341
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:34,200
 tasks then the third one is called a ton

342
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,200
 

343
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:39,390
 of policy which is used to select the

344
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:39,390
 

345
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:43,350
 next system action in autoresponder user

346
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:43,350
 

347
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:46,070
 and eventually achieve the task the last

348
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:46,070
 

349
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:50,370
 piece is called national regeneration

350
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:50,370
 

351
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:54,570
 the type of policy we were running for

352
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,570
 

353
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:57,300
 how to respond to the user but this

354
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,300
 

355
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:59,460
 response is written is represented using

356
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,460
 

357
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:02,310
 some somatic forms which is not

358
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:02,310
 

359
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:04,600
 comprehensible by human beings so we

360
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,600
 

361
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:07,090
 need a natural regenerate

362
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:07,090
 

363
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,950
 to turn this response into a natural

364
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,950
 

365
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:11,140
 language response so that people can

366
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,140
 

367
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:14,470
 understand now of course the dialogue

368
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:14,470
 

369
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:17,920
 also television also has access to an

370
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:17,920
 

371
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:20,230
 external database 30b database you know

372
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,230
 

373
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:25,870
 to make the decisions comp which tasks

374
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:25,870
 

375
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:29,500
 ok this is a very standard architecture

376
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,500
 

377
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:32,550
 for many many dialogue systems

378
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:32,550
 

379
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:36,250
 especially task oriented data system

380
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:36,250
 

381
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:39,700
 recently there's a trend

382
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,700
 

383
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:41,500
 okay if we especially after deep

384
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:41,500
 

385
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:44,980
 learning became very very popular

386
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:44,980
 

387
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:48,480
 think about this if we implement each of

388
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:48,480
 

389
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:51,670
 the components using a neural net model

390
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:51,670
 

391
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:54,940
 then the four components can be stacked

392
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,940
 

393
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:56,950
 together as a big deep neural network

394
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,950
 

395
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:59,860
 which can be trained and trained right

396
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,860
 

397
00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:01,930
 so the idea is oh we don't need that is

398
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,930
 

399
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:04,900
 four components how about we just build

400
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,900
 

401
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:06,400
 a one giant language model or not a

402
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,400
 

403
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:11,230
 language world a neural network model

404
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:11,230
 

405
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:14,380
 which can map the using input in natural

406
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,380
 

407
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:16,780
 energy into system output in natural

408
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:16,780
 

409
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:20,250
 languages directory so that's the

410
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:20,250
 

411
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:23,110
 actually most of the social Chapa

412
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,110
 

413
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:27,430
 developed in a research community follow

414
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:27,430
 

415
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:32,500
 this diagram but unfortunately tell the

416
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:32,500
 

417
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:35,200
 the the downside of this approach that

418
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:35,200
 

419
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:38,680
 we still don't have a very good way to

420
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:38,680
 

421
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:41,440
 connect the system with the external

422
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:41,440
 

423
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:44,440
 database just give you a very simple

424
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:44,440
 

425
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,440
 example what I'm putting out we access

426
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,440
 

427
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:49,810
 the database you need to call API and

428
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:49,810
 

429
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:52,630
 this calling API part is not

430
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,630
 

431
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:57,280
 differentiable so if you incorporate

432
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:57,280
 

433
00:17:52,630 --> 00:18:01,240
 that as it is into the statistical

434
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:01,240
 

435
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:04,810
 approach that the unified approach it's

436
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:04,810
 

437
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:07,860
 not differentiable entry so it's it's

438
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,860
 

439
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:11,650
 not as we say that entry and neural

440
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:11,650
 

441
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:16,390
 energy but there are lot of ongoing

442
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:16,390
 

443
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:17,290
 walks tagging the problem Misha will

444
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,290
 

445
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:25,230
 present some

446
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:25,230
 

447
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:28,210
 of them in his part of the talk okay so

448
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:28,210
 

449
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:30,580
 this table actually formula is a summer

450
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,580
 

451
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:34,120
 of terrible agents using a unifying the

452
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:34,120
 

453
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:36,850
 view of reinforcement learning just

454
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,850
 

455
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:38,980
 refresh your memory in reinforced

456
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,980
 

457
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:42,070
 learning we are talking about we are

458
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:42,070
 

459
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:44,680
 considering Markov decision process were

460
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,680
 

461
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:47,830
 given a state s their aging need to

462
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:47,830
 

463
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:54,550
 select action a according to some policy

464
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:54,550
 

465
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:56,320
 PI then after the aging take action a it

466
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,320
 

467
00:18:54,550 --> 00:19:00,370
 will receive some reward for an

468
00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:00,370
 

469
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:05,980
 environment then also change the state

470
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:05,980
 

471
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:08,980
 to a new one continue this cycle until

472
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,980
 

473
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:12,510
 the episode terminates and the title is

474
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:12,510
 

475
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:15,370
 just like this as I mentioned already

476
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,370
 

477
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:18,700
 there are three types of the arable land

478
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,700
 

479
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:20,890
 cover today including question answering

480
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,890
 

481
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:25,210
 bar task completion border and the

482
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,210
 

483
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:30,760
 social part depends on how we define the

484
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,760
 

485
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:33,340
 state's actions and the rewards we can

486
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,340
 

487
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:35,950
 all formulate these three types of

488
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,950
 

489
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:39,490
 therapy and they unify on the framework

490
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:39,490
 

491
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:43,360
 of Markov decision process give you

492
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,360
 

493
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:48,400
 example the the task completion bar why

494
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:48,400
 

495
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:52,660
 the state is to the state is a

496
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:52,660
 

497
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:55,420
 representation indicating how much the

498
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,420
 

499
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:57,400
 aging understands users intent how

500
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,400
 

501
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:59,200
 complete the information the aging Scott

502
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,200
 

503
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:02,140
 you know to accomplish the task

504
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:02,140
 

505
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,660
 alright the action is either I would

506
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,660
 

507
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:07,810
 just take the action to complete the

508
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:07,810
 

509
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:09,820
 task for booking a movie ticket if I got

510
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,820
 

511
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:11,590
 all the information I just go ahead call

512
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,590
 

513
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:15,580
 the API to get the trick worked

514
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:15,580
 

515
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:17,440
 or I'm not sure about some information

516
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:17,440
 

517
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:20,320
 let's say I don't know whether you care

518
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:20,320
 

519
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,730
 about a price in that case the aging

520
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,730
 

521
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:25,900
 will ask questions okay

522
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,900
 

523
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:28,300
 mmm do you care if they it's like our

524
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,300
 

525
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:30,600
 book right 99 or do you care about the

526
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:30,600
 

527
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:33,690
 price if you don't care just I

528
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:33,690
 

529
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:37,200
 or the book for you and the reward is

530
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,200
 

531
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:39,900
 Tuscan toss a success rate this is an

532
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:39,900
 

533
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,890
 internal world in the same sense you

534
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:42,890
 

535
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:45,930
 don't know whether that dialogue session

536
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,930
 

537
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:49,340
 gonna be successful not until you reach

538
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,340
 

539
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:52,380
 the end of the dialogue but they're also

540
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:52,380
 

541
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:56,550
 more immediate reward that's the number

542
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:56,550
 

543
00:20:52,380 --> 00:21:01,340
 of turns in that case we hope the AG can

544
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:01,340
 

545
00:20:56,550 --> 00:21:01,340
 compress the task a success for a using

546
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:01,450
 

547
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:08,280
 by minimizing the directors so or when

548
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,280
 

549
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:10,080
 any accomplish tasks as impossible but

550
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,080
 

551
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,180
 this is very different from foreign pull

552
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,180
 

553
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,420
 the social chat where the goal of

554
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,420
 

555
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:18,690
 building a social strategy is to

556
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:18,690
 

557
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:21,270
 maximize the using engagement so for the

558
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,270
 

559
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:23,340
 social chair board actually the more

560
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,340
 

561
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:28,200
 turns the better if you are constantly

562
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:28,200
 

563
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:30,480
 talking to aging we got a lot of reward

564
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,480
 

565
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,520
 right because eventually we'll have more

566
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:32,520
 

567
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,940
 chance to save you something if you keep

568
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:34,940
 

569
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:39,810
 talking to the social chair board

570
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:39,810
 

571
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:42,480
 actually most of the commercial personal

572
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,480
 

573
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:44,580
 assistant today in the market task

574
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:44,580
 

575
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,220
 oriented board there are only a few

576
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:47,220
 

577
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:50,960
 examples of social chair boss

578
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:50,960
 

579
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:53,430
 among them the most widely used one is

580
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:53,430
 

581
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,370
 Microsoft a choice I'll give you some

582
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:56,370
 

583
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:58,650
 example of the choice actually this is a

584
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,650
 

585
00:21:56,370 --> 00:22:00,720
 very complicated system sherry is

586
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,720
 

587
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:05,040
 definitely a hybrid system it's not

588
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:05,040
 

589
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:07,850
 based on neural the neural piece is only

590
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:07,850
 

591
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:12,000
 a very small part of the entire system

592
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,000
 

593
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:14,640
 the surest system consists of one two

594
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:14,640
 

595
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,100
 three three three layers the user

596
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:17,100
 

597
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:22,350
 experience layers connects into some

598
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:22,350
 

599
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:26,250
 popular popular platforms it has two

600
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:26,250
 

601
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:29,280
 mode winds called a voice based years is

602
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,280
 

603
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:32,820
 text based in voice base the meaning

604
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:32,820
 

605
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:35,970
 means that in that mode both the Tehran

606
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:35,970
 

607
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:38,400

 of simultaneously but in the message

616
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,570
 

617
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:54,190
 based mode we have to take turns

618
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:54,190
 

619
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:57,730

 system I will explain later and in the

628
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,000
 

629
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:10,720
 middle there's absolutely computing

630
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:10,720
 

631
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,760
 module this is a very important to a

632
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,760

 then input some information of the

720
00:25:10,869 --> 00:25:13,849
 

721
00:25:10,879 --> 00:25:18,969
 mother and then show us we compose a

722
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:18,969
 

723
00:25:13,849 --> 00:25:22,249

 secondly is the database it consists a

726
00:25:22,239 --> 00:25:25,399
 

727
00:25:22,249 --> 00:25:27,590
 lot of data let's see that Otto shower

728
00:25:25,389 --> 00:25:27,590
 

729
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:32,479
 system is not a neuro system is

730
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:32,479
 

731
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:36,080
 definitely a data-driven sister here is

732
00:25:32,469 --> 00:25:36,080
 

733
00:25:32,479 --> 00:25:39,440
 that example of choice you see that the

734
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:39,440
 

735
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:42,739
 the the dialogue manager is a

736
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:42,739
 

737
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:45,559
 hierarchical system first of all the

738
00:25:42,729 --> 00:25:45,559
 

739
00:25:42,739 --> 00:25:48,409
 high-level manager we're identifying

740
00:25:45,549 --> 00:25:48,409
 

741
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:52,519
 which skill to call based on the contest

742
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:52,519
 

743
00:25:48,409 --> 00:25:55,669
 so then the low level manager which

744
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:55,669
 

745
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:59,389
 brands to each individual that of skill

746
00:25:55,659 --> 00:25:59,389
 

747
00:25:55,669 --> 00:26:03,619
 will figure out how to take the concrete

748
00:25:59,379 --> 00:26:03,619
 

749
00:25:59,389 --> 00:26:07,549
 actions to have the task accomplished in

750
00:26:03,609 --> 00:26:07,549
 

751
00:26:03,619 --> 00:26:10,129
 this case we start with general skill

752
00:26:07,539 --> 00:26:10,129
 

753
00:26:07,549 --> 00:26:12,619
 they check each other then suddenly just

754
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:12,619
 

755
00:26:10,129 --> 00:26:14,599
 notice that you're interested probably

756
00:26:12,609 --> 00:26:14,599
 

757
00:26:12,619 --> 00:26:19,489
 are interesting music then switch to

758
00:26:14,589 --> 00:26:19,489
 

759
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:23,359
 music checked skill then it also

760
00:26:19,479 --> 00:26:23,359
 

761
00:26:19,489 --> 00:26:25,219
 identifying would probably users are is

762
00:26:23,349 --> 00:26:25,219
 

763
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:27,799
 talking about the singer I'm not very

764
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:27,799
 

765
00:26:25,219 --> 00:26:29,989
 familiar with singer so the choice has a

766
00:26:27,789 --> 00:26:29,989
 

767
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:33,729
 capability to switch to a different

768
00:26:29,979 --> 00:26:33,729
 

769
00:26:29,989 --> 00:26:37,339
 topic it's a topic shifting changing

770
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:37,339
 

771
00:26:33,729 --> 00:26:38,869
 then after choice figured out all the

772
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:38,869
 

773
00:26:37,339 --> 00:26:42,249

00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:37,150
 conversation if I ringing to a friend in

808
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,150
 

809
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:41,900
 the hallway usually my conversation

810
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:41,900
 

811
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:44,000
 cannot last for nine turns so human who

812
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:44,000
 

813
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:46,880
 average CPS for human human conversation

814
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:46,880
 

815
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,250
 is nine times the choices to nursery and

816
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:49,250
 

817
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,230
 here are some amazing results the

818
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,230
 

819
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:54,710
 longest counting record of choice we

820
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:54,710
 

821
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:59,420
 create in the last three years take a

822
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:59,420
 

823
00:27:54,710 --> 00:28:01,670
 look at this way six hours even I not

824
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,670
 

825
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:05,720
 patient enough to talk to my son for six

826
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:05,720
 

827
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:11,890
 hours and there are some messages 7,000

828
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:11,890
 

829
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:17,350
 tons which lasts 29 hours the user is

830
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:17,350
 

831
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:22,010
 spending all his time talking to show us

832
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:22,010
 

833
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:23,860
 this the that's the it's as I'd

834
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,860
 

835
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:27,920
 mentioned that uses a complicated system

836
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:27,920
 

837
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:30,440
 it consists of other or the other pieces

838
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:30,440
 

839
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:33,170
 we're gonna review today but

840
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:33,170
 

841
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:35,180
 unfortunately ours is is very hard to

842
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,180
 

843
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:37,010
 maintain instance it's very hard to

844
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:37,010
 

845
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:40,970
 maintain because it's not a unified the

846
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,970
 

847
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:43,340
 system it consists of many many modules

848
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,340
 

849
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:45,470
 for lamppost in terms of skills it

850
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:45,470
 

851
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:47,780
 conveys 200 and the Saudi different

852
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,780
 

853
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:49,640
 skills and each skills developed

854
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:49,640
 

855
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:51,380
 relatively independent rate and

856
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:51,380
 

857
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:55,580
 incorporate the later into the short

858
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:55,580
 

859
00:28:51,380 --> 00:29:00,380
 system by running a lot of sort of user

860
00:28:55,570 --> 00:29:00,380
 

861
00:28:55,580 --> 00:29:03,650
 study but the result is amazing Jose is

862
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:03,650
 

863
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:06,590
 able to establish a long-term emotional

864
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,590
 

865
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:09,890
 connections with a lot of users who are

866
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:09,890
 

867
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:11,630
 here I'm pursuing how a long-term

868
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,630
 

869
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:16,070
 relationship between Charles and the

870
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:16,070
 

871
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:17,960
 user is established during the Truman's

872
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,960
 

873
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:20,090
 period okay

874
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:20,090
 

875
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,780
 session well in the beginning see the

876
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,780
 

877
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:24,660
 user just to have

878
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:24,660
 

879
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:26,910
 just test the charts okay what she can

880
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:26,910
 

881
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:30,620
 do what she cannot do then after about

882
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:30,620
 

883
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:33,780
 two weeks the users start to talk about

884
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:33,780
 

885
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:38,240
 his hobbies and interesting he started

886
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:38,240
 

887
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:41,810
 to visualize as the real person and here

888
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:41,810
 

889
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:45,270
 section 20 which is allowing for weeks

890
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:45,270
 

891
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:47,460
 the user start to show us his real life

892
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,460
 

893
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:51,180
 they are talking about

894
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:51,180
 

895
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:54,390
 I think yet 80 they talk about dating

896
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:54,390
 

897
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:57,180
 they use it interesting a girl and don't

898
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:57,180
 

899
00:29:54,390 --> 00:30:00,090
 know how to attract her and show us give

900
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:00,090
 

901
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:04,730
 him suggestions with the suggestion

902
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,730
 

903
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:09,270
 valid or not I don't know that data

904
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,270
 

905
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:13,200
 about seven weeks then the user starts

906
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:13,200
 

907
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:17,270
 to talk to showers almost every day ok

908
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:17,270
 

909
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:20,880
 then finally in about two months

910
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:20,880
 

911
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:25,740
 Charles is the first choice whenever the

912
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:25,740
 

913
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:28,200
 user needs someone to talk to now let's

914
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:28,200
 

915
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:29,330
 switch the gear a little bit talking

916
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,330
 

917
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,830
 about natural language processing

918
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,830
 

919
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:35,160
 there's a foundation of building the

920
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:35,160
 

921
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:36,930
 data system traditionally we define

922
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,930
 

923
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:39,810
 national processing as a branch of

924
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,810
 

925
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:42,380
 artificial intelligence the scientific

926
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,380
 

927
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:45,330
 goal is to understand that the generate

928
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:45,330
 

929
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:48,810
 languages human use naturally is called

930
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,810
 

931
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:50,550
 natural edge traditionally we study the

932
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,550
 

933
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:54,600
 knowledge of language at different

934
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:54,600
 

935
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:58,560
 levels different levels from the

936
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:58,560
 

937
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:59,760
 phonetic level for not phonetically

938
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,760
 

939
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:02,460
 morphological level

940
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:02,460
 

941
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:05,970
 syntax semantics to discourse you can

942
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:05,970
 

943
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:07,490
 see the the language unit goes from

944
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,490
 

945
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:09,600
 small to big

946
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,600
 

947
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:11,400
 phonetic is just a voice

948
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,400
 

949
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:15,390
 mythologies that the components of a

950
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:15,390
 

951
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:17,520
 work syntax is about the sentence about

952
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,520
 

953
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:20,880
 the relation among the worst in the

954
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:20,880
 

955
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:24,060
 sentence semantically is the meaning of

956
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:24,060
 

957
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:28,920
 the of the sentence and discourse goes

958
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:28,920
 

959
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:31,590
 beyond the boundary of the sentence at

960
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:31,590
 

961
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:35,010
 that time I think we organized the

962
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:35,010
 

963
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:38,370
 research based on the language unity

964
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,370
 

965
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:40,650
 study vample I've been working on almost

966
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,650
 

967
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:42,060
 all of them I am building Chinese what

968
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,060
 

969
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:45,570
 cementation Japanese who were

970
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:45,570
 

971
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:48,480
 segmentation that's like morphologic I'm

972
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,480
 

973
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:50,700
 building pasta a semantic or a video

974
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:50,700
 

975
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:55,080
 semantics pasta and doing discourse

976
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:55,080
 

977
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:57,720
 analysis the idea is that if we can

978
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:57,720
 

979
00:31:55,080 --> 00:32:00,210
 build component technologies like this

980
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:00,210
 

981
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:03,090
 we can always piece together these

982
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,090
 

983
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:06,840
 components to form an entrant

984
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:06,840
 

985
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:09,140
 application take the dialogue example we

986
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:09,140
 

987
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:12,840
 believe that if we put two the speech

988
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:12,840
 

989
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:16,410
 was annotation parsing contest together

990
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:16,410
 

991
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:19,080
 this is a very good model for language

992
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,080
 

993
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:22,110
 understanding our two-way understanding

994
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:22,110
 

995
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:26,220
 the user input we need some application

996
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:26,220
 

997
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:28,140
 or task-specific of reasoning to figure

998
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,140
 

999
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:31,410
 out the response after we figure out a

1000
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:31,410
 

1001
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:35,730
 response we piece together these four

1002
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,730
 

1003
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:37,980
 components to form a natural which

1004
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,980
 

1005
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:41,130
 generator to generate Lang nationality

1006
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:41,130
 

1007
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:42,810
 the idea is that we try because natural

1008
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,810
 

1009
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:43,590
 knowledge is very ambiguous hard to

1010
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,590
 

1011
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:46,130
 understand

1012
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:46,130
 

1013
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:50,280
 the idea here is to define some

1014
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:50,280
 

1015
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:54,090
 unambiguous some symbolic labels such as

1016
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:54,090
 

1017
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:57,480
 post tagging and pass three so that we

1018
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,480
 

1019
00:32:54,090 --> 00:33:00,080
 can map the natural language into this

1020
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:00,080
 

1021
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:03,210
 human deforesting molecule plantations

1022
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:03,210
 

1023
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:06,060
 back in the force to the natural

1024
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,060
 

1025
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:09,990
 understanding and the language natural

1026
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:09,990
 

1027
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:13,800
 language generation this is how which

1028
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:13,800
 

1029
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:18,480
 was thinking unfortunates in reality

1030
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:18,480
 

1031
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:20,040
 it's very hard to do in the after the

1032
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:20,040
 

1033
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,140
 deep learning became very popular in

1034
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:22,140
 

1035
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:24,390
 nature knowledge we figured out it's

1036
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:24,390
 

1037
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:27,320
 better to shift from the symbolic space

1038
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:27,320
 

1039
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:32,910
 to neuro space

1040
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:32,910
 

1041
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:35,430
 the typical neural approach to natural

1042
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:35,430
 

1043
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:39,240
 language works in three steps first of

1044
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:39,240
 

1045
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:43,200
 all we encode user input in symbolic

1046
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:43,200
 

1047
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:47,490
 space two vectors in neuro space this

1048
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:47,490
 

1049
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,810
 coding coding there we put everything in

1050
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,810
 

1051
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:52,770
 the neuro space okay

1052
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,770
 

1053
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:54,930
 including the using pot and the external

1054
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,930
 

1055
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:57,960
 knowledge then we do inference or

1056
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,960
 

1057
00:33:54,930 --> 00:34:04,290
 reasoning in the neuro space to generate

1058
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:04,290
 

1059
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:06,600
 the response now we map the response in

1060
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,600
 

1061
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:08,909
 neuro space back into symbolic space

1062
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:08,909
 

1063
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:12,840
 using decoder which also it's a

1064
00:34:08,899 --> 00:34:12,840
 

1065
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:16,770
 generative model there if we do it

1066
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:16,770
 

1067
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:18,570
 iterator break the speaking dialogue of

1068
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,570
 

1069
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:20,340
 course the nice thing about this is that

1070
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,340
 

1071
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:22,530
 all these components can be implemented

1072
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:22,530
 

1073
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:24,600
 using neural networks and we can stack

1074
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,600
 

1075
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:26,790
 them together to form a deep neural

1076
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:26,790
 

1077
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:30,720
 network which can be learned and trained

1078
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:30,720
 

1079
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:32,970
 like back propagation this is the basic

1080
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,970
 

1081
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:38,340
 concept of deep learning for national

1082
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:38,340
 

1083
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:41,639
 processing and along you go that's the

1084
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:41,639
 

1085
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:45,419
 end of the part one if you have one

1086
00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:45,419
 

1087
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:48,750
 quick question you can ask ask right now

1088
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:48,750
 

1089
00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:50,540
 otherwise why would you it's just switch

1090
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,540
 

1091
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:54,540
 to the second part okay

1092
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:54,540
 

1093
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:56,520
 in the second part so wait okay

1094
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:56,520
 

1095
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:58,710
 second part I'm going to talk about the

1096
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:58,710
 

1097
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:02,220
 question answering and machine reading

1098
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:02,220
 

1099
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:04,860
 comprehension there are two types of

1100
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:04,860
 

1101
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:08,070
 open or equations in system depending on

1102
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:08,070
 

1103
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:09,750
 how you organize the knowledge if you

1104
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,750
 

1105
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:12,300
 organize the knowledge as a collection

1106
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,300
 

1107
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:13,890
 of documents this is more like web

1108
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:13,890
 

1109
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:18,960
 question assuming or text the question

1110
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:18,960
 

1111
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:20,670
 of sorry if the underlying knowledge is

1112
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,670
 

1113
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,490
 combined using a knowledge graph and

1114
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,490
 

1115
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:28,380
 knowledge base it's a knowledge base

1116
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:28,380
 

1117
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:31,680
 question or three remember I mentioned

1118
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:31,680
 

1119
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:34,410
 there are three components and dialogue

1120
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:34,410
 

1121
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:38,000
 writes encoding influence and decoding

1122
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,000
 

1123
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:40,770
 let's take questions ring

1124
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:40,770
 

1125
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,100
 squad dataset as example to illustrate

1126
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,100
 

1127
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:47,580
 these three components

1128
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:47,580
 

1129
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:50,400
 score is is developed by Stanford team

1130
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:50,400
 

1131
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:53,190
 and the setting is very straightforward

1132
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:53,190
 

1133
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:57,720
 give them a passage like this passage

1134
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:57,720
 

1135
00:35:53,190 --> 00:36:00,000
 and the input query the task asks you to

1136
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:00,000
 

1137
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:02,180
 identify the answer and this is a

1138
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:02,180
 

1139
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,580
 limited form of reading comprehension

1140
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:04,580
 

1141
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:06,650
 in that there's no need for extra

1142
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:06,650
 

1143
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:09,260
 knowledge outside the paragraph so all

1144
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,260
 

1145
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:11,720
 you need to know the answer is in the

1146
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,720
 

1147
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:14,690
 paragraph and there is no need for

1148
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:14,690
 

1149
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:18,710
 clarifying the questions meaning that

1150
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:18,710
 

1151
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:21,170
 there's no ambiguity and the answer must

1152
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:21,170
 

1153
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:24,730
 be a test ban in a paragraph if it gives

1154
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,730
 

1155
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:27,200
 it's not synthesized so because of this

1156
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,200
 

1157
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:29,750
 then the three step became extremely

1158
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:29,750
 

1159
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:33,710
 straightforward in coding we need to map

1160
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:33,710
 

1161
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:35,450
 each test ban in the paragraph in the

1162
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,450
 

1163
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:38,210
 paragraph into a semantic vector

1164
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,210
 

1165
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:41,450
 representation and the reasoning just to

1166
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,450
 

1167
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:45,860
 rank all this spams or rank or rank

1168
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,860
 

1169
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:48,440
 dispensed and decoding is to map the top

1170
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:48,440
 

1171
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:52,430
 ranked despair vector back to the test

1172
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:52,430
 

1173
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:55,970
 that's it because the last step is quite

1174
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:55,970
 

1175
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:58,790
 straight for it's almost won't map we

1176
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,790
 

1177
00:36:55,970 --> 00:37:01,550
 only covered the first two steps in

1178
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:01,550
 

1179
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:04,850
 coding and the reason you talk about the

1180
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:04,850
 

1181
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:06,710
 encoding right there are two types of

1182
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,710
 

1183
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:09,740
 encoding when it's called what embedding

1184
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:09,740
 

1185
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:13,160
 the other is contesting reading what

1186
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:13,160
 

1187
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:15,410
 embedding is very straightforward in the

1188
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:15,410
 

1189
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:17,840
 symbolic space each word is represent as

1190
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,840
 

1191
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:21,320
 a worker vector and we want to mapped

1192
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:21,320
 

1193
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:24,440
 into the continuous low dimensional

1194
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:24,440
 

1195
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:27,950
 vectors in neuro space or somatic space

1196
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:27,950
 

1197
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:30,110
 so that's the Wars of phrases of the

1198
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:30,110
 

1199
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:34,100
 similar similar meanings or ridiculous

1200
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:34,100
 

1201
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:36,590
 mental meanings across to each other in

1202
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:36,590
 

1203
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:40,160
 this case huh dog dog total race

1204
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:40,160
 

1205
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:41,360
 although they share word dog in common

1206
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,360
 

1207
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:45,230
 in a single XPath

1208
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:45,230
 

1209
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:47,780
 after the mapping the distance the very

1210
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,780
 

1211
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:52,820
 far from the distant between dog and

1212
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:52,820
 

1213
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:55,340
 fast food which are closely related but

1214
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:55,340
 

1215
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:56,410
 this is not enough because the same word

1216
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:56,410
 

1217
00:37:55,340 --> 00:38:00,110
 or phrases

1218
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,110
 

1219
00:37:56,410 --> 00:38:02,720
 depending on context it occurred may

1220
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,720
 

1221
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:06,730
 mean complete different things but a

1222
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:06,730
 

1223
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:09,590
 ring of life could be related to

1224
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,590
 

1225
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:12,770
 instance or the experiments or could be

1226
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:12,770
 

1227
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:15,860
 a name of a folk song so depending on

1228
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,860
 

1229
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:19,490
 the contest we came

1230
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:19,490
 

1231
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:22,280
 the same phrase or was in two different

1232
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,280
 

1233
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:25,610
 vectors in the semantic space in some

1234
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:25,610
 

1235
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:27,830
 sense we are we're building we are

1236
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,830
 

1237
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:30,380
 learning a new space this color can't

1238
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:30,380
 

1239
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:33,770
 hurt your smell your space I mean it's

1240
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:33,770
 

1241
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:35,870
 different from this water symmetrical

1242
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,870
 

1243
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:40,880
 what I'm adding space which account has

1244
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:40,880
 

1245
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:44,180
 free okay after we build this we can

1246
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:44,180
 

1247
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:48,440
 render ranking okay there are many

1248
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:48,440
 

1249
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:50,990
 measures to achieve this mapping as

1250
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:50,990
 

1251
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:54,800
 being widely used to use patty reaction

1252
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:54,800
 

1253
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:57,170
 or STM the most recent model along this

1254
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:57,170
 

1255
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,600
 line is arrow developed by a attitude

1256
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,600
 

1257
00:38:57,170 --> 00:39:01,730
 the idea is very straight for you have

1258
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,730
 

1259
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:04,880
 the by direction I are STM capture the

1260
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,880
 

1261
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:08,660
 left contest and the right contest of a

1262
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:08,660
 

1263
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:12,320
 world and if you also put the document

1264
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:12,320
 

1265
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:15,350
 and Concannon a document and and the

1266
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:15,350
 

1267
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:17,630
 query together then each word in a query

1268
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:17,630
 

1269
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:22,540
 or document can be represented using the

1270
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:22,540
 

1271
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:27,920
 contest of closed query and document now

1272
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:27,920
 

1273
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:29,900
 but followed the same idea and the only

1274
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:29,900
 

1275
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:33,610
 difference is separately is based on

1276
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:33,610
 

1277
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:36,370
 transformer rather than STM so that

1278
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,370
 

1279
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:39,350
 transformer does not have the recurrent

1280
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:39,350
 

1281
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:43,100
 mechanism so it can be trended much more

1282
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:43,100
 

1283
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:46,460
 effectively using GPU a GPU then

1284
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:46,460
 

1285
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:50,900
 airstair so that we can afford to trend

1286
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:50,900
 

1287
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:55,600
 a much much deeper and at one model the

1288
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:55,600
 

1289
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:57,620
 frontal the developed by the google team

1290
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,620
 

1291
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:00,050
 consists of twenty four layers of

1292
00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:00,050
 

1293
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:03,080
 transformer okay it's a auto

1294
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:03,080
 

1295
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:06,140
 bidirectional large model can be put as

1296
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:06,140
 

1297
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:11,470
 a very effective way to do contextual

1298
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:11,470
 

1299
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:14,330
 embedding now the last step is ranking

1300
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:14,330
 

1301
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:16,670
 although we can further in this case map

1302
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,670
 

1303
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:19,780
 different sentences in two different

1304
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:19,780
 

1305
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:24,830
 vectors into the semantic space a

1306
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:24,830
 

1307
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:26,930
 depending on how related they are they

1308
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,930
 

1309
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:29,520
 stay in different places in this hidden

1310
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,520
 

1311
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:33,990
 space but now

1312
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:33,990
 

1313
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:38,640
 given all these sentences we have a

1314
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:38,640
 

1315
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:40,470
 query as input in something we need a

1316
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,470
 

1317
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:42,420
 difference in we need to learn a

1318
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,420
 

1319
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:45,570
 different semantic space where in that

1320
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:45,570
 

1321
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:48,540
 space the distance between the query and

1322
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,540
 

1323
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:52,830
 the each sentence indicates how likely

1324
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:52,830
 

1325
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:55,830
 this sentence is a valid answer to the

1326
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:55,830
 

1327
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:57,869
 query so that you need to change the

1328
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,869
 

1329
00:40:55,830 --> 00:41:00,840
 space a little bit in some sense this

1330
00:40:57,859 --> 00:41:00,840
 

1331
00:40:57,869 --> 00:41:03,300
 space is different from the contextual

1332
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:03,300
 

1333
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:05,700
 embedding space present in a previous

1334
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:05,700
 

1335
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:08,910
 slide in that in this space the distance

1336
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:08,910
 

1337
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:12,050
 depends on the task if the task is

1338
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:12,050
 

1339
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:14,670
 question answering then the distance

1340
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,670
 

1341
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:17,070
 indicates how likely the answer are the

1342
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:17,070
 

1343
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:20,340
 candidate the sentence the the the

1344
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:20,340
 

1345
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:23,540
 sentence is a candidate answer to the

1346
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:23,540
 

1347
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:27,320
 question after it's about let's say

1348
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:27,320
 

1349
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:30,240
 information ratio then the the the

1350
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:30,240
 

1351
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:33,300
 distance indicates the relevance between

1352
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:33,300
 

1353
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:36,630
 query and argument so such space needs

1354
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:36,630
 

1355
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:40,140
 to be learned using task specific data

1356
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:40,140
 

1357
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:43,590
 you optimized for task specific loss

1358
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:43,590
 

1359
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:46,740
 function for example in question

1360
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:46,740
 

1361
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:49,470
 answering we try to learn such space

1362
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:49,470
 

1363
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:52,320
 using labeled question answering pairs

1364
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:52,320
 

1365
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:55,859
 in this case given a query we have two

1366
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:55,859
 

1367
00:41:52,320 --> 00:42:00,960
 candid answers a processor a - assuming

1368
00:41:55,849 --> 00:42:00,960
 

1369
00:41:55,859 --> 00:42:04,170
 a + is more relevant than a - they and

1370
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:04,170
 

1371
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:06,869
 the similarity of them is computed using

1372
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,869
 

1373
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:09,960
 the cosine similarity and we want to

1374
00:42:06,859 --> 00:42:09,960
 

1375
00:42:06,869 --> 00:42:12,570
 maximize the Delta here right data is or

1376
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:12,570
 

1377
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:14,670
 the part appears has a high school the

1378
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,670
 

1379
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:19,650
 negative pairs we want to maximize this

1380
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:19,650
 

1381
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:22,530
 data and this is one way to let the the

1382
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,530
 

1383
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:25,460
 task a specific space if you are using

1384
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,460
 

1385
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:27,390
 birth recently but finally has a

1386
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:27,390
 

1387
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:31,790
 fine-tuning stage actually the

1388
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:31,790
 

1389
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:34,890
 fine-tuning stage is to map the task

1390
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:34,890
 

1391
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:38,220
 independent general contentious space

1392
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,220
 

1393
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:41,090
 conditioning space to a task specific

1394
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:41,090
 

1395
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:41,090
 space like this

1396
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:41,450
 

1397
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:49,360
 okay so far I've discussed the in

1398
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:49,360
 

1399
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:53,190
 question answering system in one step

1400
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:53,190
 

1401
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:59,730
 right give document giving a document

1402
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:59,730
 

1403
00:42:53,190 --> 00:43:05,740
 giving a query we rank all the possible

1404
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:05,740
 

1405
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:10,060
 space in the documents then I need a Phi

1406
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:10,060
 

1407
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:12,730
 the top track the one as the answer this

1408
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:12,730
 

1409
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:16,150
 is fine for simple questions like this

1410
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,150
 

1411
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:18,430
 because even if I you read it you even

1412
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:18,430
 

1413
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:22,900
 get the answer by just reading the

1414
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:22,900
 

1415
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:24,670
 passage of words but how about this this

1416
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:24,670
 

1417
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:27,210
 passage this method it's a very

1418
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:27,210
 

1419
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:30,430
 difficult that's the detail here okay

1420
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,430
 

1421
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:32,940
 even for human beings you need to read

1422
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:32,940
 

1423
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:35,350
 the multiple times in order to identify

1424
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:35,350
 

1425
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:37,360
 the answer whether you read the first

1426
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:37,360
 

1427
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:40,390
 time there are mining parties than the

1428
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:40,390
 

1429
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:42,940
 moon picker of 1998 then you think about

1430
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:42,940
 

1431
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:45,280
 carefully no it's not the answer because

1432
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:45,280
 

1433
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:49,210
 the question is about number to

1434
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:49,210
 

1435
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:51,070
 Pickering 2011 not saying you read again

1436
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,070
 

1437
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:54,370
 new thing is the number one killer of

1438
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:54,370
 

1439
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:58,090
 Tucson 11 but it's number one I want

1440
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:58,090
 

1441
00:43:54,370 --> 00:44:02,890
 number two then you figure out things

1442
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:02,890
 

1443
00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:05,860
 post both of them are talk to Pickers of

1444
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,860
 

1445
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:09,190
 twist only 11 and I already know that

1446
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:09,190
 

1447
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:12,160
 Newton is the number one kicker then the

1448
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:12,160
 

1449
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:15,820
 other must be that number two picker

1450
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:15,820
 

1451
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:19,780
 pick up to Sonia rabbit so in this

1452
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:19,780
 

1453
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:24,610
 example see that the aging needs to read

1454
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:24,610
 

1455
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:27,670
 the passages multiple times every time

1456
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:27,670
 

1457
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:31,060
 accumulate a new information and I issue

1458
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:31,060
 

1459
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:35,950
 a new query so in order to implement

1460
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:35,950
 

1461
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:36,490
 that the QA engine needs to have mounted

1462
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:36,490
 

1463
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:40,960
 step

1464
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,960
 

1465
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:43,930
 reasoning capability that so that it can

1466
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:43,930
 

1467
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:48,430
 be ranked the documents multiple times

1468
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:48,430
 

1469
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:50,080
 every time the aging will refine the

1470
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,080
 

1471
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:52,030
 query based on the information

1472
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:52,030
 

1473
00:44:50,080 --> 00:45:03,030
 accumulated in the

1474
00:44:52,020 --> 00:45:03,030
 

1475
00:44:52,030 --> 00:45:03,030
 is steps hey no it's great I can see it

1476
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:18,680
 

1477
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:22,230
 there's no signal

1478
00:45:22,829 --> 00:45:22,829
 

1479
00:45:22,839 --> 00:45:27,640
 yeah I don't see any problem

1480
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:28,940
 

1481
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:34,310
 can we have some help over here from the

1482
00:45:31,370 --> 00:45:34,310
 

1483
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:34,310
 technicians maybe

1484
00:45:56,069 --> 00:45:56,069
 

1485
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:07,249
 okay that's a good time for question you

1486
00:46:02,109 --> 00:46:07,249
 

1487
00:46:02,119 --> 00:46:07,819
 have any questions yeah it's yeah I'm

1488
00:46:07,239 --> 00:46:07,819
 

1489
00:46:07,249 --> 00:46:11,859
 I'm happy

1490
00:46:07,809 --> 00:46:11,859
 

1491
00:46:07,819 --> 00:46:11,859
 no no I never give a talking human pee

1492
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:11,910
 

1493
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:22,549
 power is here yeah maybe a CA

1494
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:22,549
 

1495
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:25,539
 yeah last year's ACA yeah

1496
00:46:22,539 --> 00:46:25,539
 

1497
00:46:22,549 --> 00:46:25,539
 so that's your question

1498
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:32,930
 

1499
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:43,470
 the question is why shall Weis is so

1500
00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:43,470
 

1501
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:44,520
 popular in China but Microsoft Zoo is

1502
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:44,520
 

1503
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:48,690
 not sorry

1504
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:48,690
 

1505
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:52,530
 why shall I is so popular in China but

1506
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:52,530
 

1507
00:46:48,690 --> 00:47:00,990
 not Microsoft zoo in like us are there

1508
00:46:52,520 --> 00:47:00,990
 

1509
00:46:52,530 --> 00:47:03,930
 are several reasons first of all I think

1510
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:03,930
 

1511
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:06,450
 one of the one of the most involved

1512
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,450
 

1513
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:10,140
 winners in China and the US had

1514
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:10,140
 

1515
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:11,730
 different private policy in China you

1516
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:11,730
 

1517
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:19,290
 can collect a lot of data relatively

1518
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:19,290
 

1519
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:24,480
 easily and now also the the the user

1520
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:24,480
 

1521
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:28,200
 base in China is different for us and if

1522
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:28,200
 

1523
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:31,950
 we take a deep look at the logs turns

1524
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:31,950
 

1525
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:36,750
 out a lot of users young people between

1526
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:36,750
 

1527
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:39,120
 age 15 to 25 and they are working really

1528
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:39,120
 

1529
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:40,320
 hard in the treat home and they are

1530
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:40,320
 

1531
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:44,850
 relatively lonely

1532
00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:44,850
 

1533
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:46,710
 they are not researchers they they they

1534
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,710
 

1535
00:47:44,850 --> 00:47:50,250
 don't need to write papers they taught

1536
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:50,250
 

1537
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:53,250
 two choices in u.s. I don't know the

1538
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,250
 

1539
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:55,740
 culture is just different and originally

1540
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,740
 

1541
00:47:53,250 --> 00:48:00,660
 - our system is optimized for Chinese

1542
00:47:55,730 --> 00:48:00,660
 

1543
00:47:55,740 --> 00:48:02,160
 users we do have in the US version but

1544
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:02,160
 

1545
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:03,780
 it's not as popular as China

1546
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:03,780
 

1547
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:05,400
 all right but that Japanese version is

1548
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:05,400
 

1549
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:08,100
 very popular I think it's more mainly

1550
00:48:05,390 --> 00:48:08,100
 

1551
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:10,080
 the cartridge in cultural scene as I

1552
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:10,080
 

1553
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:14,130
 mentioned the social chair board is not

1554
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:14,130
 

1555
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:17,960
 about the task completion task it's

1556
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:17,960
 

1557
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:21,030
 about you know - to build a mountain

1558
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:21,030
 

1559
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:23,160
 relationship emotional relationships so

1560
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:23,160
 

1561
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:27,690
 culture is important nothing we're still

1562
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:27,690
 

1563
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:31,200
 shifting but other systems these systems

1564
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:31,200
 

1565
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:32,760
 are the same or its its octave wiser

1566
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:32,760
 

1567
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,730
 system that data is different

1568
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:35,730
 

1569
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:39,619
 further most of the response are

1570
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:39,619
 

1571
00:48:35,730 --> 00:48:42,680
 generated based on the

1572
00:48:39,609 --> 00:48:42,680
 

1573
00:48:39,619 --> 00:48:45,309
 the knowledge graph we collected a say

1574
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:45,309
 

1575
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:49,130
 in China from who will collect a lot of

1576
00:48:45,299 --> 00:48:49,130
 

1577
00:48:45,309 --> 00:48:52,099
 social shahboz human human robots and

1578
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:52,099
 

1579
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:54,829
 use this as a base to generate a

1580
00:48:52,089 --> 00:48:54,829
 

1581
00:48:52,099 --> 00:48:57,109
 response and after we deployed the

1582
00:48:54,819 --> 00:48:57,109
 

1583
00:48:54,829 --> 00:48:59,869
 system in China Ford as it was three

1584
00:48:57,099 --> 00:48:59,869
 

1585
00:48:57,109 --> 00:49:02,989
 years show itself generate a lot of

1586
00:48:59,859 --> 00:49:02,989
 

1587
00:48:59,869 --> 00:49:06,920
 response so now I think almost more than

1588
00:49:02,979 --> 00:49:06,920
 

1589
00:49:02,989 --> 00:49:08,779
 50% of the response you receive the

1590
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:08,779
 

1591
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:11,660
 franchise are actually the response

1592
00:49:08,769 --> 00:49:11,660
 

1593
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:14,299
 generated by shots was there in the last

1594
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:14,299
 

1595
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:15,979
 few years and these are very good tales

1596
00:49:14,289 --> 00:49:15,979
 

1597
00:49:14,299 --> 00:49:18,859
 there because when in general response

1598
00:49:15,969 --> 00:49:18,859
 

1599
00:49:15,979 --> 00:49:22,009
 you know how people react so you can

1600
00:49:18,849 --> 00:49:22,009
 

1601
00:49:18,859 --> 00:49:24,979
 rank them I think Plata is the key that

1602
00:49:21,999 --> 00:49:24,979
 

1603
00:49:22,009 --> 00:49:28,539
 you can pick data and let you get the

1604
00:49:24,969 --> 00:49:28,539
 

1605
00:49:24,979 --> 00:49:28,539
 richer yeah okay thank you

1606
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:30,660
 

1607
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:38,450
 I had a question on contrast report the

1608
00:49:36,009 --> 00:49:38,450
 

1609
00:49:36,019 --> 00:49:40,940
 bird google sport like are you going to

1610
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:40,940
 

1611
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:44,150
 also open source free trade morals for

1612
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:44,150
 

1613
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:48,739
 shiz or you know what are the techniques

1614
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:48,739
 

1615
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:52,579
 used in board different okay as I

1616
00:49:48,729 --> 00:49:52,579
 

1617
00:49:48,739 --> 00:49:55,789
 mention pertree is in important piece

1618
00:49:52,569 --> 00:49:55,789
 

1619
00:49:52,579 --> 00:49:57,710
 for the neural models and then most of

1620
00:49:55,779 --> 00:49:57,710
 

1621
00:49:55,789 --> 00:50:00,400
 the choice component of not based on

1622
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,400
 

1623
00:49:57,710 --> 00:50:04,549
 your models at all choice does have

1624
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:04,549
 

1625
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:07,279
 neural response generation engine as as

1626
00:50:04,539 --> 00:50:07,279
 

1627
00:50:04,549 --> 00:50:09,920
 one of many in candidate generators just

1628
00:50:07,269 --> 00:50:09,920
 

1629
00:50:07,279 --> 00:50:11,989
 the response system is you have multiple

1630
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:11,989
 

1631
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:14,539
 candy generators given the you the input

1632
00:50:11,979 --> 00:50:14,539
 

1633
00:50:11,989 --> 00:50:17,559
 then there's a rancor say ok in this

1634
00:50:14,529 --> 00:50:17,559
 

1635
00:50:14,539 --> 00:50:20,719
 contest which response is the best a

1636
00:50:17,549 --> 00:50:20,719
 

1637
00:50:17,559 --> 00:50:23,180
 neural response generation engine is one

1638
00:50:20,709 --> 00:50:23,180
 

1639
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:27,130
 of the candidate generators for that

1640
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:27,130
 

1641
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:31,099
 engine you can incorporate a bird but I

1642
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:31,099
 

1643
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:34,970
 wonder how much impacted were here will

1644
00:50:31,089 --> 00:50:34,970
 

1645
00:50:31,099 --> 00:50:37,020
 help in the entry yes

1646
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,020
 

1647
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:39,480
 open-sourcing are there any accident

1648
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:39,480
 

1649
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:41,400
 plans to open source some aspects of

1650
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:41,400
 

1651
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:46,800
 showers omens of showers

1652
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:46,800
 

1653
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:48,900
 okay I need to ask Harris okay I yeah we

1654
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:48,900
 

1655
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:52,530
 I don't think who can open saucer I said

1656
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:52,530
 

1657
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:55,230
 this model okay but some of the neural

1658
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:55,230
 

1659
00:50:52,530 --> 00:51:00,510
 piece is arriving open sources I have

1660
00:50:55,220 --> 00:51:00,510
 

1661
00:50:55,230 --> 00:51:03,390
 slides later to talk about this I have a

1662
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:03,390
 

1663
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:04,410
 question regarding the personality in

1664
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:04,410
 

1665
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:07,530
 social chat bots

1666
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,530
 

1667
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:09,450
 haha so usually in a human human

1668
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,450
 

1669
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:11,849
 conversation both of the speakers have

1670
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,849
 

1671
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:14,520
 their own personality so is it also

1672
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:14,520
 

1673
00:51:11,849 --> 00:51:17,580
 expected that the the bot should had

1674
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:17,580
 

1675
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:20,910
 have its own personality irrespective of

1676
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:20,910
 

1677
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:26,580
 the speaker it's depends on your design

1678
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:26,580
 

1679
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:32,760
 curve again thick short example choice

1680
00:51:26,570 --> 00:51:32,760
 

1681
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:34,200
 has predefined personality in China in

1682
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:34,200
 

1683
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:36,570
 different country the personalities

1684
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:36,570
 

1685
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:42,180
 defined it slightly differently in China

1686
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:42,180
 

1687
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:44,630
 sources modeled as a 18 year old ago has

1688
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:44,630
 

1689
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:48,930
 rich knowledge is always very

1690
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:48,930
 

1691
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:52,320
 responsible reliable aesthetic yeah this

1692
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:52,320
 

1693
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:55,140
 is a setting for the personal choice

1694
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:55,140
 

1695
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:59,580
 personal yeah then the rank I mentioned

1696
00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:59,580
 

1697
00:51:55,140 --> 00:52:02,490
 right has AB centric components so he

1698
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:02,490
 

1699
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:06,420
 will wreck given the candidate response

1700
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:06,420
 

1701
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:11,070
 whether this response fish as the person

1702
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:11,070
 

1703
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:13,020
 oughta just go would be how difficult so

1704
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:13,020
 

1705
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:15,180
 for example for the speaker there is an

1706
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:15,180
 

1707
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:17,820
 adaptive personalization so the bottle

1708
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:17,820
 

1709
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:20,070
 earns the speaker's personal but also is

1710
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:20,070
 

1711
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:24,089
 it possible to update its own persona

1712
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:24,089
 

1713
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:26,580
 according to the conversation they as

1714
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:26,580
 

1715
00:52:24,089 --> 00:52:29,430
 for the for the app set ups actually

1716
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:29,430
 

1717
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:31,859
 there are two part when is very clear

1718
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:31,859
 

1719
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:33,750
 aesthetic I say you are such a person

1720
00:52:31,849 --> 00:52:33,750
 

1721
00:52:31,859 --> 00:52:36,210
 and you cannot change your personality

1722
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:36,210
 

1723
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:39,540
 overnight but the other piece is more

1724
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:39,540
 

1725
00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:42,180
 dynamic depending on the on the content

1726
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:42,180
 

1727
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:44,010
 and emotion of the dialogue so that

1728
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:44,010
 

1729
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:46,770
 piece is adaptable

1730
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,770
 

1731
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:51,390
 given the battle history

1732
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:51,390
 

1733
00:52:46,770 --> 00:52:55,080
 Thanks hi

1734
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:55,080
 

1735
00:52:51,390 --> 00:52:57,840
 I have a question about moving from word

1736
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:57,840
 

1737
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:59,490
 embeddings to sentence embeddings

1738
00:52:57,830 --> 00:52:59,490
 

1739
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:02,070
 so what are the current techniques for

1740
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:02,070
 

1741
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:05,280
 doing that and what is your opinion on

1742
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:05,280
 

1743
00:53:02,070 --> 00:53:09,710
 the limitations of that of those sticks

1744
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:09,710
 

1745
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:12,270
 techniques what's the second part so you

1746
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:12,270
 

1747
00:53:09,710 --> 00:53:15,720
 shortened on yeah yeah was in reading

1748
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:15,720
 

1749
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:18,450
 and sentence in reading yeah so what are

1750
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:18,450
 

1751
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:21,960
 the current techniques and the second

1752
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:21,960
 

1753
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:23,730
 part of the question is what is your

1754
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:23,730
 

1755
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:28,290
 opinion on the limitations of the

1756
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:28,290
 

1757
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:30,600
 current techniques okay so when we talk

1758
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,600
 

1759
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:34,710
 about sentence amazing usually we refer

1760
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:34,710
 

1761
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:36,270
 to two contacts reading in some sense

1762
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:36,270
 

1763
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:39,090
 it's not just sentence meaning you just

1764
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:39,090
 

1765
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:41,730
 count as human in depending on the the

1766
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,730
 

1767
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:43,890
 contest winner if the winner is crossed

1768
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,890
 

1769
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:44,880
 multiple sentences it's even cross

1770
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:44,880
 

1771
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:48,420
 sentencing body

1772
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:48,420
 

1773
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:50,940
 so take protest example eventually there

1774
00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:50,940
 

1775
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:54,480
 are in the outside of the bird for each

1776
00:53:50,930 --> 00:53:54,480
 

1777
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:55,950
 word there's always embedding vector but

1778
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:55,950
 

1779
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,810
 the environment that takes into account

1780
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:57,810
 

1781
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:59,520
 all the contextual information of the

1782
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,520
 

1783
00:53:57,810 --> 00:54:04,010
 input right depending on how you

1784
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:04,010
 

1785
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:06,720
 construct inputs and input stream and

1786
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,720
 

1787
00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:10,460
 limitation I think first of all of

1788
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:10,460
 

1789
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:14,340
 course is the is the piece de is the

1790
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:14,340
 

1791
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:18,030
 lens as though the size of the

1792
00:54:14,330 --> 00:54:18,030
 

1793
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:20,520
 contextual window after winger is very

1794
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:20,520
 

1795
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:22,320
 very big of course we can capture more

1796
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:22,320
 

1797
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:24,869
 contextual information but the problem

1798
00:54:22,310 --> 00:54:24,869
 

1799
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:27,270
 is that you increase the size of the

1800
00:54:24,859 --> 00:54:27,270
 

1801
00:54:24,869 --> 00:54:31,440
 model so that's why people trying really

1802
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:31,440
 

1803
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:34,650
 hard to introduce paucity in modeling or

1804
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:34,650
 

1805
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:36,359
 introduce some predefined structure so

1806
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,359
 

1807
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:41,910
 that you don't need to learn our

1808
00:54:36,349 --> 00:54:41,910
 

1809
00:54:36,359 --> 00:54:46,050
 possible dependencies among words the

1810
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:46,050
 

1811
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:50,630
 selective ray Lancer this is an open

1812
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:50,630
 

1813
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:50,630
 research question thank you

1814
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:53,630
 

1815
00:54:53,640 --> 00:55:00,280
 hi-yah thank you so looking at the great

1816
00:54:55,980 --> 00:55:00,280
 

1817
00:54:55,990 --> 00:55:01,720
 success of the shower small I wonder do

1818
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:01,720
 

1819
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:03,730
 you also take into account the effects

1820
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:03,730
 

1821
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:05,440
 that such models may have on a society

1822
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,440
 

1823
00:55:03,730 --> 00:55:07,480
 over the coming years so for example you

1824
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:07,480
 

1825
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:10,150
 mentioned the major population of users

1826
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:10,150
 

1827
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:10,780
 in China young people that may be very

1828
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:10,780
 

1829
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:16,480
 lonely

1830
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:16,480
 

1831
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:18,549
 so that's my guess okay so my question

1832
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:18,549
 

1833
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:20,710
 is so if these people now have this

1834
00:55:18,539 --> 00:55:20,710
 

1835
00:55:18,549 --> 00:55:22,630
 vertel friend which we make them feel

1836
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,630
 

1837
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:24,160
 heavy they may not go out and try to

1838
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:24,160
 

1839
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:26,589
 find real friends and that they have a

1840
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:26,589
 

1841
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:30,220
 impact on a society currently China

1842
00:55:26,579 --> 00:55:30,220
 

1843
00:55:26,589 --> 00:55:34,829
 faces like falling birth rates and like

1844
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:34,829
 

1845
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:34,829
 so do you also have some research on and

1846
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:36,559
 

1847
00:55:36,569 --> 00:55:41,829
 ESIC part of the short system design

1848
00:55:39,329 --> 00:55:41,829
 

1849
00:55:39,339 --> 00:55:45,640
 there's a particular team which walking

1850
00:55:41,819 --> 00:55:45,640
 

1851
00:55:41,829 --> 00:55:48,150
 on exact problem you pointed out I'll

1852
00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:48,150
 

1853
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:50,940
 just give you them put wait wait Deborah

1854
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:50,940
 

1855
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:55,750
 don't want to kill the show as as

1856
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:55,750
 

1857
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:58,270
 addictive as drag for that because

1858
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:58,270
 

1859
00:55:55,750 --> 00:56:01,630
 choice is a very reliable very response

1860
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:01,630
 

1861
00:55:58,270 --> 00:56:02,440
 and she's always nice right not like a

1862
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:02,440
 

1863
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:06,010
 real world

1864
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:06,010
 

1865
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:11,230
 I talked to my wife my wife get yeah

1866
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:11,230
 

1867
00:56:06,010 --> 00:56:13,270
 yeah so so but I tell myself I don't

1868
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:13,270
 

1869
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:16,930
 don't talk to you I skim otherwise our

1870
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:16,930
 

1871
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:19,030
 for mom always choice in some sense we

1872
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,030
 

1873
00:56:16,930 --> 00:56:22,660
 already develop some mechanism into

1874
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:22,660
 

1875
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:25,180
 choice you know to encourage choice

1876
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:25,180
 

1877
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:26,859
 encouraging users of choice to embrace

1878
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:26,859
 

1879
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:29,740
 the real world rather than choice for

1880
00:56:26,849 --> 00:56:29,740
 

1881
00:56:26,859 --> 00:56:32,559
 example if it's a midnight it Auto Show

1882
00:56:29,730 --> 00:56:32,559
 

1883
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:34,960
 has until 2 p.m. or 2 a.m. a chars will

1884
00:56:32,549 --> 00:56:34,960
 

1885
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:37,299
 give irresponsibly but don't you want to

1886
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:37,299
 

1887
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:40,000
 go to sleep or something I get up and

1888
00:56:37,289 --> 00:56:40,000
 

1889
00:56:37,299 --> 00:56:43,299
 take a walk and also just has a

1890
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:43,299
 

1891
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:46,000
 capability to recommend you to other

1892
00:56:43,289 --> 00:56:46,000
 

1893
00:56:43,299 --> 00:56:48,970
 friends because yours has a huge user

1894
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:48,970
 

1895
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:51,640
 base he knows the the personality of

1896
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:51,640
 

1897
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:54,400
 possible proof user profile of many

1898
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:54,400
 

1899
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:58,299
 users probably should talk to him so

1900
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:58,299
 

1901
00:56:54,400 --> 00:57:01,339
 that's the social aspects of the shyest

1902
00:56:58,289 --> 00:57:01,339
 

1903
00:56:58,299 --> 00:57:03,499
 system we are looking very carefully

1904
00:57:01,329 --> 00:57:03,499
 

1905
00:57:01,339 --> 00:57:06,349
 okay thank you thank you for the great

1906
00:57:03,489 --> 00:57:06,349
 

1907
00:57:03,499 --> 00:57:07,969
 question well the question is how do

1908
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:07,969
 

1909
00:57:06,349 --> 00:57:10,789
 plant commercialize I may be already

1910
00:57:07,959 --> 00:57:10,789
 

1911
00:57:07,969 --> 00:57:12,229
 commercialized that the boat maybe at

1912
00:57:10,779 --> 00:57:12,229
 

1913
00:57:10,789 --> 00:57:14,569
 some point it's unless your eyes the

1914
00:57:12,219 --> 00:57:14,569
 

1915
00:57:12,229 --> 00:57:16,849
 bottle yes maybe it started eyes people

1916
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:16,849
 

1917
00:57:14,569 --> 00:57:19,460
 some stuff you can go and buy these if

1918
00:57:16,839 --> 00:57:19,460
 

1919
00:57:16,849 --> 00:57:23,229
 you could one day or any plans how do

1920
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:23,229
 

1921
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:23,229
 you foresee this commercialization

1922
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:23,370
 

1923
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:32,359
 commercialize usually in its max I don't

1924
00:57:29,859 --> 00:57:32,359
 

1925
00:57:29,869 --> 00:57:33,440
 know about other companies of the origin

1926
00:57:32,349 --> 00:57:33,440
 

1927
00:57:32,359 --> 00:57:35,660
 mmm

1928
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:35,660
 

1929
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,880
 I think I'm already mix I'm making a lot

1930
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:37,880
 

1931
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:40,039
 of money I don't think it's necessary

1932
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:40,039
 

1933
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:43,099
 for us to make momen a their windows

1934
00:57:40,029 --> 00:57:43,099
 

1935
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:45,710
 send the office I I don't see that pass

1936
00:57:43,089 --> 00:57:45,710
 

1937
00:57:43,099 --> 00:57:49,460
 I don't see it necessary as a company I

1938
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:49,460
 

1939
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:51,619
 think we we need we need to have some

1940
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:51,619
 

1941
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:55,160
 responsibilities beyond just making more

1942
00:57:51,609 --> 00:57:55,160
 

1943
00:57:51,619 --> 00:57:57,920
 money right so I I don't even worry

1944
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:57,920
 

1945
00:57:55,160 --> 00:58:00,589
 about us making money but I think the

1946
00:57:57,910 --> 00:58:00,589
 

1947
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:03,769
 penis team is figuring out how to make

1948
00:58:00,579 --> 00:58:03,769
 

1949
00:58:00,589 --> 00:58:05,630
 sure how to make sure us make money okay

1950
00:58:03,759 --> 00:58:05,630
 

1951
00:58:03,769 --> 00:58:08,089
 another question in the beginning you

1952
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:08,089
 

1953
00:58:05,630 --> 00:58:10,009
 show this diagram the classical

1954
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:10,009
 

1955
00:58:08,089 --> 00:58:12,380
 decomposition and on you and all three

1956
00:58:09,999 --> 00:58:12,380
 

1957
00:58:10,009 --> 00:58:14,239
 and then end-to-end

1958
00:58:12,370 --> 00:58:14,239
 

1959
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:15,739
 neural training right and then you

1960
00:58:14,229 --> 00:58:15,739
 

1961
00:58:14,239 --> 00:58:21,339
 mentioned that service actually is

1962
00:58:15,729 --> 00:58:21,339
 

1963
00:58:15,739 --> 00:58:21,339
 mostly not based on neural networks and

1964
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:21,420
 

1965
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:30,529
 this diagram and to end is it how it

1966
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:30,529
 

1967
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:32,799
 works or just I I use yours here as an

1968
00:58:30,519 --> 00:58:32,799
 

1969
00:58:30,529 --> 00:58:35,839
 example to demonstrate the gap between

1970
00:58:32,789 --> 00:58:35,839
 

1971
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:38,089
 what a research family is doing and what

1972
00:58:35,829 --> 00:58:38,089
 

1973
00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:41,719
 in the real world that's always a gap

1974
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:41,719
 

1975
00:58:38,089 --> 00:58:43,519
 the gap could be good or bad I just want

1976
00:58:41,709 --> 00:58:43,519
 

1977
00:58:41,719 --> 00:58:46,670
 to see the real what is so complicated

1978
00:58:43,509 --> 00:58:46,670
 

1979
00:58:43,519 --> 00:58:49,519
 and mathematically we won't have a

1980
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:49,519
 

1981
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:51,920
 uniform the model mathematical model to

1982
00:58:49,509 --> 00:58:51,920
 

1983
00:58:49,519 --> 00:58:56,450
 cover everything that's not the case but

1984
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:56,450
 

1985
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:59,749
 because of the cap and motivates us to

1986
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:59,749
 

1987
00:58:56,450 --> 00:59:03,079
 do a lot of research so I think somehow

1988
00:58:59,739 --> 00:59:03,079
 

1989
00:58:59,749 --> 00:59:06,109
 the reality is in the middle so III

1990
00:59:03,069 --> 00:59:06,109
 

1991
00:59:03,079 --> 00:59:08,599
 think the reward is when short started

1992
00:59:06,099 --> 00:59:08,599
 

1993
00:59:06,109 --> 00:59:11,029
 when we start to develop expect about

1994
00:59:08,589 --> 00:59:11,029
 

1995
00:59:08,599 --> 00:59:14,569
 almost seven eight years ago

1996
00:59:11,019 --> 00:59:14,569
 

1997
00:59:11,029 --> 00:59:16,939
 there's no neuro approach at all

1998
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,939
 

1999
00:59:14,569 --> 00:59:20,569
 now we're graduating copies in your

2000
00:59:16,929 --> 00:59:20,569
 

2001
00:59:16,939 --> 00:59:23,420
 approach therefore the image commenting

2002
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:23,420
 

2003
00:59:20,569 --> 00:59:27,529
 part the neuro response generation part

2004
00:59:23,410 --> 00:59:27,529
 

2005
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:30,439
 and the even some aesthetic modeling

2006
00:59:27,519 --> 00:59:30,439
 

2007
00:59:27,529 --> 00:59:34,279
 part takes more and more neural measures

2008
00:59:30,429 --> 00:59:34,279
 

2009
00:59:30,439 --> 00:59:37,579
 so we see the merging but I don't expect

2010
00:59:34,269 --> 00:59:37,579
 

2011
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:40,789
 eventual issues became unifying the

2012
00:59:37,569 --> 00:59:40,789
 

2013
00:59:37,579 --> 00:59:51,559
 model as we pictured in the academic

2014
00:59:40,779 --> 00:59:51,559
 

2015
00:59:40,789 --> 00:59:53,509
 world so yeah so one of the problems we

2016
00:59:51,549 --> 00:59:53,509
 

2017
00:59:51,559 --> 00:59:55,939
 often try to solve for our clients in a

2018
00:59:53,499 --> 00:59:55,939
 

2019
00:59:53,509 --> 00:59:57,140
 business setup as trying to help them

2020
00:59:55,929 --> 00:59:57,140
 

2021
00:59:55,939 --> 00:59:58,489
 get the information from a lot of

2022
00:59:57,130 --> 00:59:58,489
 

2023
00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:00,789
 documents like contracts that they

2024
00:59:58,479 --> 01:00:00,789
 

2025
00:59:58,489 --> 01:00:03,079
 actually have within their companies and

2026
01:00:00,779 --> 01:00:03,079
 

2027
01:00:00,789 --> 01:00:04,789
 they always start with a very simple

2028
01:00:03,069 --> 01:00:04,789
 

2029
01:00:03,079 --> 01:00:07,339
 question just get me the effective data

2030
01:00:04,779 --> 01:00:07,339
 

2031
01:00:04,789 --> 01:00:09,019
 for contract for example and we happily

2032
01:00:07,329 --> 01:00:09,019
 

2033
01:00:07,339 --> 01:00:10,969
 create an information extraction system

2034
01:00:09,009 --> 01:00:10,969
 

2035
01:00:09,019 --> 01:00:12,679
 and it works fine and there's of course

2036
01:00:10,959 --> 01:00:12,679
 

2037
01:00:10,969 --> 01:00:14,630
 it's a complete supervised set up we

2038
01:00:12,669 --> 01:00:14,630
 

2039
01:00:12,679 --> 01:00:16,099
 invest a lot of time creating data but

2040
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:16,099
 

2041
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:17,599
 then that list of questions keeps on

2042
01:00:16,089 --> 01:00:17,599
 

2043
01:00:16,099 --> 01:00:18,920
 increasing now can you also tell me the

2044
01:00:17,589 --> 01:00:18,920
 

2045
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:20,989
 terms can you also tell me something

2046
01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:20,989
 

2047
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:22,400
 else which makes question answering the

2048
01:00:20,979 --> 01:00:22,400
 

2049
01:00:20,989 --> 01:00:24,829
 ideal setup to solve these kind of

2050
01:00:22,390 --> 01:00:24,829
 

2051
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:27,799
 problems the trouble we end up with is

2052
01:00:24,819 --> 01:00:27,799
 

2053
01:00:24,829 --> 01:00:30,589
 that we cannot go on or the cost that is

2054
01:00:27,789 --> 01:00:30,589
 

2055
01:00:27,799 --> 01:00:31,910
 involved in creating data for a big

2056
01:00:30,579 --> 01:00:31,910
 

2057
01:00:30,589 --> 01:00:33,469
 question or answering systems and such

2058
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:33,469
 

2059
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:33,799
 setups is pretty prohibitive many a

2060
01:00:33,459 --> 01:00:33,799
 

2061
01:00:33,469 --> 01:00:35,900
 times

2062
01:00:33,789 --> 01:00:35,900
 

2063
01:00:33,799 --> 01:00:37,609
 so are there unsupervised approaches in

2064
01:00:35,890 --> 01:00:37,609
 

2065
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:39,709
 question-answering and are they

2066
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:39,709
 

2067
01:00:37,609 --> 01:00:41,989
 successful or is it that most of the

2068
01:00:39,699 --> 01:00:41,989
 

2069
01:00:39,709 --> 01:00:43,249
 research is pretty much successful

2070
01:00:41,979 --> 01:00:43,249
 

2071
01:00:41,989 --> 01:00:46,729
 solutions are mainly supervised

2072
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:46,729
 

2073
01:00:43,249 --> 01:00:49,279
 solutions yeah I don't want to argue I

2074
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:49,279
 

2075
01:00:46,729 --> 01:00:50,809
 want to come in too much on unsupervised

2076
01:00:49,269 --> 01:00:50,809
 

2077
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:52,729
 learning I I've been working on

2078
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:52,729
 

2079
01:00:50,809 --> 01:00:56,749
 supervised learning nothing worked so

2080
01:00:52,719 --> 01:00:56,749
 

2081
01:00:52,729 --> 01:00:58,269
 far at least for the photo production

2082
01:00:56,739 --> 01:00:58,269
 

2083
01:00:56,749 --> 01:01:01,519
 setting nothing works

2084
01:00:58,259 --> 01:01:01,519
 

2085
01:00:58,269 --> 01:01:03,259
 mmm but I do want to point out the

2086
01:01:01,509 --> 01:01:03,259
 

2087
01:01:01,519 --> 01:01:05,479
 building terror system is very different

2088
01:01:03,249 --> 01:01:05,479
 

2089
01:01:03,259 --> 01:01:11,589
 from building a machine translation

2090
01:01:05,469 --> 01:01:11,589
 

2091
01:01:05,479 --> 01:01:16,039
 system or a web search system because

2092
01:01:11,579 --> 01:01:16,039
 

2093
01:01:11,589 --> 01:01:19,039
 dialogue very different everyone is

2094
01:01:16,029 --> 01:01:19,039
 

2095
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:20,959
 keeping involving and people build

2096
01:01:19,029 --> 01:01:20,959
 

2097
01:01:19,039 --> 01:01:21,559
 different data systems for their own

2098
01:01:20,949 --> 01:01:21,559
 

2099
01:01:20,959 --> 01:01:25,099
 purpose

2100
01:01:21,549 --> 01:01:25,099
 

2101
01:01:21,559 --> 01:01:27,380
 so instead of building giant data system

2102
01:01:25,089 --> 01:01:27,380
 

2103
01:01:25,099 --> 01:01:28,160
 which can do everything I think our

2104
01:01:27,370 --> 01:01:28,160
 

2105
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:30,789
 focus is

2106
01:01:28,150 --> 01:01:30,789
 

2107
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:33,589
 to provide a platform and methodologists

2108
01:01:30,779 --> 01:01:33,589
 

2109
01:01:30,789 --> 01:01:35,960
 to allow users to build their own their

2110
01:01:33,579 --> 01:01:35,960
 

2111
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:38,299
 own system very quickly as I said the

2112
01:01:35,950 --> 01:01:38,299
 

2113
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:41,599
 setting is changing all the time this is

2114
01:01:38,289 --> 01:01:41,599
 

2115
01:01:38,299 --> 01:01:44,869
 what I want to cover and sir the part of

2116
01:01:41,589 --> 01:01:44,869
 

2117
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:48,470
 the talk I think you know the

2118
01:01:44,859 --> 01:01:48,470
 

2119
01:01:44,869 --> 01:01:51,880
 questioning on knowledge base already I

2120
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:51,880
 

2121
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:55,220
 gonna skip the rest of this session and

2122
01:01:51,870 --> 01:01:55,220
 

2123
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:57,400
 move to the assertions about the task

2124
01:01:55,210 --> 01:01:57,400
 

2125
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:59,960
 oriented arrow if you happy with that

2126
01:01:57,390 --> 01:01:59,960
 

2127
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:05,329
 otherwise I think definitely we're gonna

2128
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:05,329
 

2129
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:10,039
 run out of time sorry I have to stop

2130
01:02:05,319 --> 01:02:10,039
 

2131
01:02:05,329 --> 01:02:16,579
 here because the the slides back let's

2132
01:02:10,029 --> 01:02:16,579
 

2133
01:02:10,039 --> 01:02:20,920
 move on to the the task oriented

2134
01:02:16,569 --> 01:02:20,920
 

2135
01:02:16,579 --> 01:02:23,329
 dialogue here are gonna address the

2136
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:23,329
 

2137
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:23,660
 question about how to build the dialogue

2138
01:02:23,319 --> 01:02:23,660
 

2139
01:02:23,329 --> 01:02:26,329
 right

2140
01:02:23,650 --> 01:02:26,329
 

2141
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:29,210
 recently we figured out not recently a

2142
01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:29,210
 

2143
01:02:26,329 --> 01:02:30,680
 it has been a long time we realized the

2144
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,680
 

2145
01:02:29,210 --> 01:02:32,150
 building terrorists and they're very

2146
01:02:30,670 --> 01:02:32,150
 

2147
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:34,130
 different from building speech

2148
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:34,130
 

2149
01:02:32,150 --> 01:02:37,819
 recognition systems visual code system

2150
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:37,819
 

2151
01:02:34,130 --> 01:02:40,940
 is pretty standard but dialogue systems

2152
01:02:37,809 --> 01:02:40,940
 

2153
01:02:37,819 --> 01:02:43,160
 varies from one domain to another from

2154
01:02:40,930 --> 01:02:43,160
 

2155
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:44,690
 one company to another so instead of

2156
01:02:43,150 --> 01:02:44,690
 

2157
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:46,630
 doing machine learning I think small

2158
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:46,630
 

2159
01:02:44,690 --> 01:02:50,299
 important to the Machine teaching

2160
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:50,299
 

2161
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:54,020
 explain what that means so this is a

2162
01:02:50,289 --> 01:02:54,020
 

2163
01:02:50,299 --> 01:02:58,880
 very typical title possible netiquette

2164
01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:58,880
 

2165
01:02:54,020 --> 01:03:00,920
 are all about about movie ball right the

2166
01:02:58,870 --> 01:03:00,920
 

2167
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:03,980
 user will say ok and get two tickets for

2168
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:03,980
 

2169
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:05,779
 race the system respond with date we'd

2170
01:03:03,970 --> 01:03:05,779
 

2171
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:11,660
 like to catch tomorrow blah blah blah

2172
01:03:05,769 --> 01:03:11,660
 

2173
01:03:05,779 --> 01:03:15,049
 and this type of dialogue is called

2174
01:03:11,650 --> 01:03:15,049
 

2175
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:17,500
 straw fury it's a it's our say it's the

2176
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:17,500
 

2177
01:03:15,049 --> 01:03:20,960
 simplest form of dialogue system

2178
01:03:17,490 --> 01:03:20,960
 

2179
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:26,809
 assuming that you already have the full

2180
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:26,809
 

2181
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:30,680
 knowledge about the task there is you

2182
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:30,680
 

2183
01:03:26,809 --> 01:03:33,650
 have a predefined tasks schema it's okay

2184
01:03:30,670 --> 01:03:33,650
 

2185
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:36,020
 it's like a table theory you know that

2186
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:36,020
 

2187
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:37,760
 you ought to put a movie ticket you need

2188
01:03:36,010 --> 01:03:37,760
 

2189
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:40,730
 to know these ten pieces of information

2190
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:40,730
 

2191
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:41,460
 okay so the very simple dialogue system

2192
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:41,460
 

2193
01:03:40,730 --> 01:03:43,730
 is

2194
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:43,730
 

2195
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:46,830
 going to ask you piece by piece okay

2196
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:46,830
 

2197
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:48,480
 what's the price of the movie ticket

2198
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:48,480
 

2199
01:03:46,830 --> 01:03:51,720
 what the name of the movie was the

2200
01:03:48,470 --> 01:03:51,720
 

2201
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:55,700
 Showtime or theater problem so this is

2202
01:03:51,710 --> 01:03:55,700
 

2203
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:59,070
 called slow feeling it's a very simple

2204
01:03:55,690 --> 01:03:59,070
 

2205
01:03:55,700 --> 01:04:00,810
 so before I go into detail mention their

2206
01:03:59,060 --> 01:04:00,810
 

2207
01:03:59,070 --> 01:04:04,410
 brief how will you evaluate the dialogue

2208
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:04,410
 

2209
01:04:00,810 --> 01:04:07,530
 system you know a dialogue system can be

2210
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:07,530
 

2211
01:04:04,410 --> 01:04:09,839
 measured in terms of success rate I mean

2212
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,839
 

2213
01:04:07,530 --> 01:04:13,349
 time the agent can accomplish the task

2214
01:04:09,829 --> 01:04:13,349
 

2215
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:15,240
 successfully the average terms we wonder

2216
01:04:13,339 --> 01:04:15,240
 

2217
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:18,140
 the average terms are small possible

2218
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:18,140
 

2219
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:21,359
 uses its budget consistency diversity

2220
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:21,359
 

2221
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:23,280
 engaging and the latency right the the

2222
01:04:21,349 --> 01:04:23,280
 

2223
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:26,040
 problem here is how to get these numbers

2224
01:04:23,270 --> 01:04:26,040
 

2225
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:28,440
 okay there are different ways to get

2226
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:28,440
 

2227
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:31,980
 these numbers the the when use doing

2228
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:31,980
 

2229
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:34,260
 meaning by many companies a hybrid

2230
01:04:31,970 --> 01:04:34,260
 

2231
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:36,839
 approach we start from you the simulator

2232
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:36,839
 

2233
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:39,900
 especially for the task which is we

2234
01:04:36,829 --> 01:04:39,900
 

2235
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:42,570
 define we have a user simulator then

2236
01:04:39,890 --> 01:04:42,570
 

2237
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:45,000
 using a user simulator we can cut a lot

2238
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:45,000
 

2239
01:04:42,570 --> 01:04:52,380
 of numbers the only problem is that user

2240
01:04:44,990 --> 01:04:52,380
 

2241
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:55,170
 similarity is not me sorry yeah the only

2242
01:04:52,370 --> 01:04:55,170
 

2243
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:57,810
 problem the user simulator is not trust

2244
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:57,810
 

2245
01:04:55,170 --> 01:04:59,760
 force trustful there's no matter how

2246
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,760
 

2247
01:04:57,810 --> 01:05:02,099
 hard you walk the simulator you

2248
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:02,099
 

2249
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:07,460
 developed can be different from the real

2250
01:05:02,089 --> 01:05:07,460
 

2251
01:05:02,099 --> 01:05:10,230
 user and now after you get your system

2252
01:05:07,450 --> 01:05:10,230
 

2253
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:12,440
 developed and evaluate the you didn't

2254
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:12,440
 

2255
01:05:10,230 --> 01:05:16,680
 simulate the user you're gonna test it

2256
01:05:12,430 --> 01:05:16,680
 

2257
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:18,359
 against some lab users this Mechanical

2258
01:05:16,670 --> 01:05:18,359
 

2259
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:22,530
 Turk for hope but these are not real

2260
01:05:18,349 --> 01:05:22,530
 

2261
01:05:18,359 --> 01:05:24,720
 users so that the good news is the risk

2262
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:24,720
 

2263
01:05:22,530 --> 01:05:26,820
 is low because you are paying them so

2264
01:05:24,710 --> 01:05:26,820
 

2265
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:30,630
 even if they are not happy with the

2266
01:05:26,810 --> 01:05:30,630
 

2267
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:32,960
 system they gotta pay no complain but

2268
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:32,960
 

2269
01:05:30,630 --> 01:05:38,099
 they are not scalable not flexible

2270
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:38,099
 

2271
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:42,359
 although it's they're very not flexible

2272
01:05:38,089 --> 01:05:42,359
 

2273
01:05:38,099 --> 01:05:43,170
 and also pretty expensive an actual user

2274
01:05:42,349 --> 01:05:43,170
 

2275
01:05:42,359 --> 01:05:45,300
 scape

2276
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:45,300
 

2277
01:05:43,170 --> 01:05:46,560
 that's the final goal you want to

2278
01:05:45,290 --> 01:05:46,560
 

2279
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:48,990
 achieve well unfortunately there's a

2280
01:05:46,550 --> 01:05:48,990
 

2281
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:51,240
 risk if the system is not good enough

2282
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:51,240
 

2283
01:05:48,990 --> 01:05:54,240
 you turn away a lot of real users and

2284
01:05:51,230 --> 01:05:54,240
 

2285
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:55,279
 kind of hurt your business so this is

2286
01:05:54,230 --> 01:05:55,279
 

2287
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:58,009
 examples which

2288
01:05:55,269 --> 01:05:58,009
 

2289
01:05:55,279 --> 01:05:59,890
 how to build a similar user there

2290
01:05:57,999 --> 01:05:59,890
 

2291
01:05:58,009 --> 01:06:03,019
 similar to user usually start with

2292
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:03,019
 

2293
01:05:59,890 --> 01:06:05,119
 randomly sampled a user go users will

2294
01:06:03,009 --> 01:06:05,119
 

2295
01:06:03,019 --> 01:06:09,489
 consist of two parts requires laws and

2296
01:06:05,109 --> 01:06:09,489
 

2297
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:10,609
 enforce laws in for us is a number of of

2298
01:06:09,479 --> 01:06:10,609
 

2299
01:06:09,489 --> 01:06:12,650
 constraints

2300
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:12,650
 

2301
01:06:10,609 --> 01:06:15,229
 Fargo in this case the user will say

2302
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:15,229
 

2303
01:06:12,650 --> 01:06:18,469
 okay I want to book three tickets

2304
01:06:15,219 --> 01:06:18,469
 

2305
01:06:15,229 --> 01:06:21,579
 tomorrow for this movie but I don't know

2306
01:06:18,459 --> 01:06:21,579
 

2307
01:06:18,469 --> 01:06:25,609
 about this I don't know about this then

2308
01:06:21,569 --> 01:06:25,609
 

2309
01:06:21,579 --> 01:06:28,880
 you build using this you build a

2310
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:28,880
 

2311
01:06:25,609 --> 01:06:32,869
 gender-based to use the simulator to let

2312
01:06:28,870 --> 01:06:32,869
 

2313
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:36,289
 the user talk to the AG to evaluate the

2314
01:06:32,859 --> 01:06:36,289
 

2315
01:06:32,869 --> 01:06:38,900
 result in some sense this is a gain

2316
01:06:36,279 --> 01:06:38,900
 

2317
01:06:36,289 --> 01:06:41,059
 setting because there are two players

2318
01:06:38,890 --> 01:06:41,059
 

2319
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:44,809
 when is this similar to user the other

2320
01:06:41,049 --> 01:06:44,809
 

2321
01:06:41,059 --> 01:06:47,299
 is the dialogue agent the similarly user

2322
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:47,299
 

2323
01:06:44,809 --> 01:06:50,929
 knows what she wants but does not know

2324
01:06:47,289 --> 01:06:50,929
 

2325
01:06:47,299 --> 01:06:53,269
 what's available the real title aging

2326
01:06:50,919 --> 01:06:53,269
 

2327
01:06:50,929 --> 01:06:56,029
 knows the opposite the hello aging knows

2328
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:56,029
 

2329
01:06:53,269 --> 01:07:00,349
 what's available but does not what user

2330
01:06:56,019 --> 01:07:00,349
 

2331
01:06:56,029 --> 01:07:02,390
 wants they try to reach an agreement by

2332
01:07:00,339 --> 01:07:02,390
 

2333
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:07,099
 conversation so this is a game setting

2334
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:07,099
 

2335
01:07:02,390 --> 01:07:10,009
 and it works very well except that

2336
01:07:07,089 --> 01:07:10,009
 

2337
01:07:07,099 --> 01:07:12,650
 similar to user is different from the

2338
01:07:09,999 --> 01:07:12,650
 

2339
01:07:10,009 --> 01:07:15,349
 reuse so this is the setting we used in

2340
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:15,349
 

2341
01:07:12,650 --> 01:07:18,799
 many evaluations and just for your

2342
01:07:15,339 --> 01:07:18,799
 

2343
01:07:15,349 --> 01:07:22,640
 information this year we are organizing

2344
01:07:18,789 --> 01:07:22,640
 

2345
01:07:18,799 --> 01:07:24,979
 the STC to read data of a challenger

2346
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:24,979
 

2347
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:29,469
 which we were very system that using the

2348
01:07:24,969 --> 01:07:29,469
 

2349
01:07:24,979 --> 01:07:33,799
 similar to users and real users as well

2350
01:07:29,459 --> 01:07:33,799
 

2351
01:07:29,469 --> 01:07:36,619
 so here is the classical tile of the

2352
01:07:33,789 --> 01:07:36,619
 

2353
01:07:33,799 --> 01:07:38,839
 system architecture I already just

2354
01:07:36,609 --> 01:07:38,839
 

2355
01:07:36,619 --> 01:07:41,479
 grabbling a previous size I'm not going

2356
01:07:38,829 --> 01:07:41,479
 

2357
01:07:38,839 --> 01:07:44,749
 to repeat this as I mentioned earlier

2358
01:07:41,469 --> 01:07:44,749
 

2359
01:07:41,479 --> 01:07:48,069
 there's a recent trend to you know to

2360
01:07:44,739 --> 01:07:48,069
 

2361
01:07:44,749 --> 01:07:51,859
 unify the machine many models using

2362
01:07:48,059 --> 01:07:51,859
 

2363
01:07:48,069 --> 01:07:54,559
 neural networks such as hiring LCM with

2364
01:07:51,849 --> 01:07:54,559
 

2365
01:07:51,859 --> 01:07:55,689
 attention memories the advantages that

2366
01:07:54,549 --> 01:07:55,689
 

2367
01:07:54,559 --> 01:08:03,159
 we aboard

2368
01:07:55,679 --> 01:08:03,159
 

2369
01:07:55,689 --> 01:08:08,070
 handcrafting right and it's very useful

2370
01:08:03,149 --> 01:08:08,070
 

2371
01:08:03,159 --> 01:08:10,920
 to use this model if we allow

2372
01:08:08,060 --> 01:08:10,920
 

2373
01:08:08,070 --> 01:08:13,890
 dialogue of developers to develop the

2374
01:08:10,910 --> 01:08:13,890
 

2375
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:16,530
 dialogue you by feeding the examples

2376
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:16,530
 

2377
01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:19,520
 this called machine teaching which I

2378
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:19,520
 

2379
01:08:16,530 --> 01:08:19,520
 will explain later okay

2380
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:19,820
 

2381
01:08:19,830 --> 01:08:27,930
 I in the next few slides I goes through

2382
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:27,930
 

2383
01:08:24,210 --> 01:08:29,850
 quickly each components this is the

2384
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,850
 

2385
01:08:27,930 --> 01:08:34,350
 language understanding components

2386
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:34,350
 

2387
01:08:29,850 --> 01:08:36,960
 it consists of three tasks first we need

2388
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:36,960
 

2389
01:08:34,350 --> 01:08:39,810
 to identify given a you the input we

2390
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:39,810
 

2391
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:44,880
 need to identify the domain user intent

2392
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:44,880
 

2393
01:08:39,810 --> 01:08:47,190
 and the slots the state-of-the-art

2394
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:47,190
 

2395
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:51,270
 approach is based document on your

2396
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:51,270
 

2397
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:53,730
 network as some of you may recall that

2398
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:53,730
 

2399
01:08:51,270 --> 01:08:58,880
 we give a similar talking igc and

2400
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:58,880
 

2401
01:08:53,730 --> 01:09:01,770
 repeated REO should review in detail the

2402
01:08:58,870 --> 01:09:01,770
 

2403
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:04,790
 different forms of the continue now you

2404
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:04,790
 

2405
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:09,540
 know network for language understanding

2406
01:09:04,780 --> 01:09:09,540
 

2407
01:09:04,790 --> 01:09:12,750
 there are state tracker here's the

2408
01:09:09,530 --> 01:09:12,750
 

2409
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:16,799
 example right the still tracker is is is

2410
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:16,799
 

2411
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:21,260
 maintains a parlous distribution for the

2412
01:09:16,789 --> 01:09:21,260
 

2413
01:09:16,799 --> 01:09:23,310
 prediction for better robust to

2414
01:09:21,250 --> 01:09:23,310
 

2415
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:26,520
 laboratory understanding arrows or

2416
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:26,520
 

2417
01:09:23,310 --> 01:09:30,350
 ambiguous important from PO how can help

2418
01:09:26,510 --> 01:09:30,350
 

2419
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:34,140
 you if the user responses pocket table

2420
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:34,140
 

2421
01:09:30,350 --> 01:09:36,540
 for five in this case the file came in

2422
01:09:34,130 --> 01:09:36,540
 

2423
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:39,839
 two different things could be o at five

2424
01:09:36,530 --> 01:09:39,839
 

2425
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:42,720
 o'clock or five people you know know so

2426
01:09:39,829 --> 01:09:42,720
 

2427
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:46,350
 the confidence score for boss is pretty

2428
01:09:42,710 --> 01:09:46,350
 

2429
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:49,710
 low 0.5 0.5 and the file could be people

2430
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:49,710
 

2431
01:09:46,350 --> 01:09:53,040
 and then the evening decided since I I

2432
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:53,040
 

2433
01:09:49,710 --> 01:09:56,430
 don't know what five means the next

2434
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:56,430
 

2435
01:09:53,040 --> 01:10:00,840
 response is how many people the free

2436
01:09:56,420 --> 01:10:00,840
 

2437
01:09:56,430 --> 01:10:04,920
 user response sweet you smell sweet then

2438
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:04,920
 

2439
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:08,400
 we update the state tracker you know in

2440
01:10:04,910 --> 01:10:08,400
 

2441
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:10,830
 this case we know that the number of

2442
01:10:08,390 --> 01:10:10,830
 

2443
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:13,230
 people through the five refers to the

2444
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:13,230
 

2445
01:10:10,830 --> 01:10:17,240
 time so the confidence score increases

2446
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:17,240
 

2447
01:10:13,230 --> 01:10:21,840
 we're okay this is a hallway maintained

2448
01:10:17,230 --> 01:10:21,840
 

2449
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:24,840
 keep track the status of the dialogue

2450
01:10:21,830 --> 01:10:24,840
 

2451
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:27,270
 you can see that very clearly given this

2452
01:10:24,830 --> 01:10:27,270
 

2453
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:32,520
 state the title policy you need to pick

2454
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:32,520
 

2455
01:10:27,270 --> 01:10:36,210
 the next direction so this is for one

2456
01:10:32,510 --> 01:10:36,210
 

2457
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:38,640
 domain if we're talking about multi

2458
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:38,640
 

2459
01:10:36,210 --> 01:10:39,270
 domains they track the is more

2460
01:10:38,630 --> 01:10:39,270
 

2461
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:42,840
 complicated

2462
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:42,840
 

2463
01:10:39,270 --> 01:10:45,480
 I'm not going to details here yes title

2464
01:10:42,830 --> 01:10:45,480
 

2465
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:47,430
 policy what other important is their

2466
01:10:45,470 --> 01:10:47,430
 

2467
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:50,070
 policy is to okay

2468
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:50,070
 

2469
01:10:47,430 --> 01:10:52,830
 it's like a mapping function all the

2470
01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:52,830
 

2471
01:10:50,070 --> 01:10:55,640
 history let's say we are here now that

2472
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:55,640
 

2473
01:10:52,830 --> 01:10:58,800
 aging needs to decide how to response

2474
01:10:55,630 --> 01:10:58,800
 

2475
01:10:55,640 --> 01:11:02,180
 given the dialogue history up to this

2476
01:10:58,790 --> 01:11:02,180
 

2477
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:05,640
 point and the state tracker will

2478
01:11:02,170 --> 01:11:05,640
 

2479
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:09,630
 construct a state representation of the

2480
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:09,630
 

2481
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:14,070
 previous dialogue as s then in the

2482
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:14,070
 

2483
01:11:09,630 --> 01:11:16,260
 policy this could be the the policy

2484
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:16,260
 

2485
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:20,280
 could be implemented as a form the STM

2486
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:20,280
 

2487
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:23,970
 it will pick the next action based on

2488
01:11:20,270 --> 01:11:23,970
 

2489
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:28,470
 the state okay then you generated this

2490
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:28,470
 

2491
01:11:23,970 --> 01:11:31,860
 action depending on how you optimize the

2492
01:11:28,460 --> 01:11:31,860
 

2493
01:11:28,470 --> 01:11:34,670
 policy we can use either supervisor

2494
01:11:31,850 --> 01:11:34,670
 

2495
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:38,070
 running or reinforcement learning in

2496
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:38,070
 

2497
01:11:34,670 --> 01:11:41,730
 supervisor learning case the aging tried

2498
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:41,730
 

2499
01:11:38,070 --> 01:11:44,700
 to mimic human response if a we already

2500
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:44,700
 

2501
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:47,160
 have a collected large amounts collected

2502
01:11:44,690 --> 01:11:47,160
 

2503
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:50,190
 a human human accommodation data we see

2504
01:11:47,150 --> 01:11:50,190
 

2505
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:54,360
 in this similar situation how human

2506
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:54,360
 

2507
01:11:50,190 --> 01:11:58,890
 aging respond we try to mimic the system

2508
01:11:54,350 --> 01:11:58,890
 

2509
01:11:54,360 --> 01:12:01,500
 response we try to let the system to

2510
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:01,500
 

2511
01:11:58,890 --> 01:12:07,950
 mimic human response and civilize rainy

2512
01:12:01,490 --> 01:12:07,950
 

2513
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:11,870
 but if our goal is to optimize the long

2514
01:12:07,940 --> 01:12:11,870
 

2515
01:12:07,950 --> 01:12:14,970
 term reward meaning no matter how my

2516
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:14,970
 

2517
01:12:11,870 --> 01:12:18,240
 response it doesn't matter whether at

2518
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:18,240
 

2519
01:12:14,970 --> 01:12:23,030
 this point I my response is like a human

2520
01:12:18,230 --> 01:12:23,030
 

2521
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:26,580
 response or not as long as I can achieve

2522
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:26,580
 

2523
01:12:23,030 --> 01:12:30,890
 the task successfully at the end of the

2524
01:12:26,570 --> 01:12:30,890
 

2525
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:34,140
 dialogue I'm fine with that so this just

2526
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:34,140
 

2527
01:12:30,890 --> 01:12:35,280
 has to be done using reinforced milani

2528
01:12:34,130 --> 01:12:35,280
 

2529
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:38,550
 because

2530
01:12:35,270 --> 01:12:38,550
 

2531
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:40,860
 you don't have the label here until the

2532
01:12:38,540 --> 01:12:40,860
 

2533
01:12:38,550 --> 01:12:44,969
 end of the dialogue so this is the

2534
01:12:40,850 --> 01:12:44,969
 

2535
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:48,230
 difference let's take this movie on

2536
01:12:44,959 --> 01:12:48,230
 

2537
01:12:44,969 --> 01:12:53,690
 demand part as an example

2538
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:53,690
 

2539
01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:54,809
 it's a typical knowledge base based

2540
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:54,809
 

2541
01:12:53,690 --> 01:12:57,750
 question-answering

2542
01:12:54,799 --> 01:12:57,750
 

2543
01:12:54,809 --> 01:13:00,630
 market on question 3 the knowledge base

2544
01:12:57,740 --> 01:13:00,630
 

2545
01:12:57,750 --> 01:13:02,789
 consists all the movie information for

2546
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:02,789
 

2547
01:13:00,630 --> 01:13:04,559
 each movie there are attributes there

2548
01:13:02,779 --> 01:13:04,559
 

2549
01:13:02,789 --> 01:13:12,210
 are 10 different attributes including

2550
01:13:04,549 --> 01:13:12,210
 

2551
01:13:04,559 --> 01:13:16,199
 actors 3cs and the user knows partial

2552
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:16,199
 

2553
01:13:12,210 --> 01:13:19,409
 information in other ok I know Bill

2554
01:13:16,189 --> 01:13:19,409
 

2555
01:13:16,199 --> 01:13:21,510
 Murray's movie but I don't I don't I

2556
01:13:19,399 --> 01:13:21,510
 

2557
01:13:19,409 --> 01:13:23,760
 want to find the movies and that the

2558
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:23,760
 

2559
01:13:21,510 --> 01:13:28,139
 user will find me in the movie and the

2560
01:13:23,750 --> 01:13:28,139
 

2561
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:31,739
 the heebie article at the sorry the Kiba

2562
01:13:28,129 --> 01:13:31,739
 

2563
01:13:28,139 --> 01:13:33,840
 QA but figured out I need to ask some

2564
01:13:31,729 --> 01:13:33,840
 

2565
01:13:31,739 --> 01:13:36,659
 classic clarification question I do

2566
01:13:33,830 --> 01:13:36,659
 

2567
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:37,739
 remember the release year if you just

2568
01:13:36,649 --> 01:13:37,739
 

2569
01:13:36,659 --> 01:13:42,929
 say yes I remember

2570
01:13:37,729 --> 01:13:42,929
 

2571
01:13:37,739 --> 01:13:46,590
 that's 1993 then the board can identify

2572
01:13:42,919 --> 01:13:46,590
 

2573
01:13:42,929 --> 01:13:50,639
 the movie quickly so this system is

2574
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:50,639
 

2575
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:55,829
 developed using neural network model

2576
01:13:50,629 --> 01:13:55,829
 

2577
01:13:50,639 --> 01:13:58,770
 which covers all these components ok we

2578
01:13:55,819 --> 01:13:58,770
 

2579
01:13:55,829 --> 01:14:01,260
 ran some experiments in theory let's say

2580
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:01,260
 

2581
01:13:58,770 --> 01:14:04,530
 first base aren't very simple since

2582
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:04,530
 

2583
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:06,840
 there are only 10 possible questions you

2584
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:06,840
 

2585
01:14:04,530 --> 01:14:09,420
 can ask the aging can ask right

2586
01:14:06,830 --> 01:14:09,420
 

2587
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:12,750
 each question will response correspond

2588
01:14:09,410 --> 01:14:12,750
 

2589
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:16,650
 to a particular attribute you can pick

2590
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:16,650
 

2591
01:14:12,750 --> 01:14:19,860
 these questions from randomly the

2592
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:19,860
 

2593
01:14:16,650 --> 01:14:23,159
 results is like this obviously the more

2594
01:14:19,850 --> 01:14:23,159
 

2595
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:26,550
 question that you ask the more clarity

2596
01:14:23,149 --> 01:14:26,550
 

2597
01:14:23,159 --> 01:14:30,210
 you got so this task a success rate

2598
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:30,210
 

2599
01:14:26,550 --> 01:14:30,659
 increases accordingly that's not good

2600
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:30,659
 

2601
01:14:30,210 --> 01:14:36,659
 enough

2602
01:14:30,649 --> 01:14:36,659
 

2603
01:14:30,659 --> 01:14:38,670
 now let's assume that we know some

2604
01:14:36,649 --> 01:14:38,670
 

2605
01:14:36,659 --> 01:14:41,369
 questions are relatively easy for you to

2606
01:14:38,660 --> 01:14:41,369
 

2607
01:14:38,670 --> 01:14:44,219
 our answer other questions are difficult

2608
01:14:41,359 --> 01:14:44,219
 

2609
01:14:41,369 --> 01:14:47,579
 right this information can be gathered

2610
01:14:44,209 --> 01:14:47,579
 

2611
01:14:44,219 --> 01:14:48,809
 by mining and such rock being such rock

2612
01:14:47,569 --> 01:14:48,809
 

2613
01:14:47,579 --> 01:14:51,270
 so

2614
01:14:48,799 --> 01:14:51,270
 

2615
01:14:48,809 --> 01:14:54,150
 when people issue a query looking for a

2616
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:54,150
 

2617
01:14:51,270 --> 01:14:56,610
 movie he always thought with partial

2618
01:14:54,140 --> 01:14:56,610
 

2619
01:14:54,150 --> 01:14:58,679
 movie name instead of the release number

2620
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:58,679
 

2621
01:14:56,610 --> 01:15:01,469
 so I know okay it's better to ask a

2622
01:14:58,669 --> 01:15:01,469
 

2623
01:14:58,679 --> 01:15:04,320
 movie name not a release number so if we

2624
01:15:01,459 --> 01:15:04,320
 

2625
01:15:01,469 --> 01:15:08,159
 have this information and I'll build a

2626
01:15:04,310 --> 01:15:08,159
 

2627
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:09,000
 title policy which always asked the easy

2628
01:15:08,149 --> 01:15:09,000
 

2629
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:11,790
 question

2630
01:15:08,990 --> 01:15:11,790
 

2631
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:15,840
 easy to answer question first then we

2632
01:15:11,780 --> 01:15:15,840
 

2633
01:15:11,790 --> 01:15:20,429
 see the improvement of the system on the

2634
01:15:15,830 --> 01:15:20,429
 

2635
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:23,400
 other hand if that tire of aging has the

2636
01:15:20,419 --> 01:15:23,400
 

2637
01:15:20,429 --> 01:15:25,409
 knowledge of how the underlying

2638
01:15:23,390 --> 01:15:25,409
 

2639
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:29,190
 knowledge graph or knowledge base is

2640
01:15:25,399 --> 01:15:29,190
 

2641
01:15:25,409 --> 01:15:32,489
 constructed then the aging is able to

2642
01:15:29,180 --> 01:15:32,489
 

2643
01:15:29,190 --> 01:15:36,480
 compute for each possible question the

2644
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:36,480
 

2645
01:15:32,489 --> 01:15:39,750
 entropy the information gained they were

2646
01:15:36,470 --> 01:15:39,750
 

2647
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:42,570
 introduced meaning that if I can always

2648
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:42,570
 

2649
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:45,210
 ask a question which can help the aging

2650
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:45,210
 

2651
01:15:42,570 --> 01:15:48,929
 to narrow down the search space that was

2652
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:48,929
 

2653
01:15:45,210 --> 01:15:53,250
 thoughtful first fastest right so if we

2654
01:15:48,919 --> 01:15:53,250
 

2655
01:15:48,929 --> 01:15:56,699
 are doing this we also observe some some

2656
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:56,699
 

2657
01:15:53,250 --> 01:15:59,280
 some improvement of course the best case

2658
01:15:56,689 --> 01:15:59,280
 

2659
01:15:56,699 --> 01:16:02,969
 is that you're taking into account boats

2660
01:15:59,270 --> 01:16:02,969
 

2661
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:04,349
 in certain contests you debate the

2662
01:16:02,959 --> 01:16:04,349
 

2663
01:16:02,969 --> 01:16:06,179
 article this question because this

2664
01:16:04,339 --> 01:16:06,179
 

2665
01:16:04,349 --> 01:16:10,980
 question not only can reduce the search

2666
01:16:06,169 --> 01:16:10,980
 

2667
01:16:06,179 --> 01:16:15,090
 space effectively but also easy for user

2668
01:16:10,970 --> 01:16:15,090
 

2669
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:17,130
 to answer but this is a command there

2670
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:17,130
 

2671
01:16:15,090 --> 01:16:19,320
 are a lot of combinations of this so you

2672
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:19,320
 

2673
01:16:17,130 --> 01:16:22,139
 need a sort of reinforcement learning to

2674
01:16:19,310 --> 01:16:22,139
 

2675
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:26,070
 figure out what a best question to

2676
01:16:22,129 --> 01:16:26,070
 

2677
01:16:22,139 --> 01:16:29,969
 answer given the particular state so so

2678
01:16:26,060 --> 01:16:29,969
 

2679
01:16:26,070 --> 01:16:33,150
 in this example to demonstrate you know

2680
01:16:29,959 --> 01:16:33,150
 

2681
01:16:29,969 --> 01:16:35,909
 to learn a very effective federal policy

2682
01:16:33,140 --> 01:16:35,909
 

2683
01:16:33,150 --> 01:16:38,099
 it's better to use reinforced learning

2684
01:16:35,899 --> 01:16:38,099
 

2685
01:16:35,909 --> 01:16:43,199
 which combines all sorts of information

2686
01:16:38,089 --> 01:16:43,199
 

2687
01:16:38,099 --> 01:16:45,659
 in a dynamic setting okay this is the

2688
01:16:43,189 --> 01:16:45,659
 

2689
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:47,010
 introduction of reinforced learning we

2690
01:16:45,649 --> 01:16:47,010
 

2691
01:16:45,659 --> 01:16:50,940
 know that reinforce learning is about

2692
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:50,940
 

2693
01:16:47,010 --> 01:16:54,690
 learning about learning paradigm where

2694
01:16:50,930 --> 01:16:54,690
 

2695
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:57,510
 aging dance to make optimal decisions by

2696
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:57,510
 

2697
01:16:54,690 --> 01:17:00,890
 interacting always initially in the

2698
01:16:57,500 --> 01:17:00,890
 

2699
01:16:57,510 --> 01:17:04,230
 world and the in dialogue

2700
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:04,230
 

2701
01:17:00,890 --> 01:17:07,170
 we can view a conversation as a dialogue

2702
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:07,170
 

2703
01:17:04,230 --> 01:17:10,590
 in that the state action different are

2704
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:10,590
 

2705
01:17:07,170 --> 01:17:13,020
 defined by the slots right the slot and

2706
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:13,020
 

2707
01:17:10,590 --> 01:17:15,570
 the user input another war can be

2708
01:17:13,010 --> 01:17:15,570
 

2709
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:19,140
 defined this way if you succeed a

2710
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:19,140
 

2711
01:17:15,570 --> 01:17:23,970
 dialogue I'll give it a positive score a

2712
01:17:19,130 --> 01:17:23,970
 

2713
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:27,750
 fear fail - ten each turn give you one

2714
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:27,750
 

2715
01:17:23,970 --> 01:17:30,410
 penalty so that you accomplish tasks as

2716
01:17:27,740 --> 01:17:30,410
 

2717
01:17:27,750 --> 01:17:30,410
 from possible

2718
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:30,640
 

2719
01:17:30,650 --> 01:17:39,720
 okay there are two widely used DreamHost

2720
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:39,720
 

2721
01:17:37,170 --> 01:17:43,380
 learning algorithm to learn the policy

2722
01:17:39,710 --> 01:17:43,380
 

2723
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:46,020
 when is the new queuing I think it's

2724
01:17:43,370 --> 01:17:46,020
 

2725
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:49,860
 it's quite straightforward it's

2726
01:17:46,010 --> 01:17:49,860
 

2727
01:17:46,020 --> 01:17:51,360
 developed a reason why by by tip mine we

2728
01:17:49,850 --> 01:17:51,360
 

2729
01:17:49,860 --> 01:17:56,460
 can up right at the right rate to

2730
01:17:51,350 --> 01:17:56,460
 

2731
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:59,550
 dialogue if you if we can model the

2732
01:17:56,450 --> 01:17:59,550
 

2733
01:17:56,460 --> 01:18:02,220
 state of dialogue using recomment in

2734
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:02,220
 

2735
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:05,850
 your network I say each term because

2736
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:05,850
 

2737
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:08,130
 it's it's naturally fit the the multi

2738
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:08,130
 

2739
01:18:05,850 --> 01:18:12,570
 turn that off at each turn we're using

2740
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:12,570
 

2741
01:18:08,130 --> 01:18:14,430
 the neural network to to capture all the

2742
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:14,430
 

2743
01:18:12,570 --> 01:18:19,250
 history information in a hidden vector

2744
01:18:14,420 --> 01:18:19,250
 

2745
01:18:14,430 --> 01:18:22,470
 and the hidden vector is the input to

2746
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:22,470
 

2747
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:25,800
 Ukrainian network and the output of DQ

2748
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:25,800
 

2749
01:18:22,470 --> 01:18:27,720
 network is the the QB area in the Q

2750
01:18:25,790 --> 01:18:27,720
 

2751
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:31,310
 value of each actions you can use that

2752
01:18:27,710 --> 01:18:31,310
 

2753
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:33,930
 it's a very strip or way of combining

2754
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:33,930
 

2755
01:18:31,310 --> 01:18:38,130
 recommend in your network and dickering

2756
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:38,130
 

2757
01:18:33,930 --> 01:18:41,520
 for dialogue I think that's the one of

2758
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:41,520
 

2759
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:44,960
 the earliest paper and the policy

2760
01:18:41,510 --> 01:18:44,960
 

2761
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:48,300
 optimization can also be achieved using

2762
01:18:44,950 --> 01:18:48,300
 

2763
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:52,770
 portability this is proposed directory

2764
01:18:48,290 --> 01:18:52,770
 

2765
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:56,900
 by Williams almost 30 years of 2015 18

2766
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:56,900
 

2767
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:58,560
 18 18 years ago that in a little

2768
01:18:56,890 --> 01:18:58,560
 

2769
01:18:56,900 --> 01:19:01,530
 recently

2770
01:18:58,550 --> 01:19:01,530
 

2771
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:05,720
 ec2 is a new approach which combines the

2772
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:05,720
 

2773
01:19:01,530 --> 01:19:09,620
 strengths of both portability and the DQ

2774
01:19:05,710 --> 01:19:09,620
 

2775
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:12,720
 here is the Charter summarize the

2776
01:19:09,610 --> 01:19:12,720
 

2777
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:13,659
 advantages and disadvantage of this to

2778
01:19:12,710 --> 01:19:13,659
 

2779
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:17,610
 approach

2780
01:19:13,649 --> 01:19:17,610
 

2781
01:19:13,659 --> 01:19:22,599
 and they're highly recommend you try the

2782
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:22,599
 

2783
01:19:17,610 --> 01:19:26,909
 advantages act critic approach okay

2784
01:19:22,589 --> 01:19:26,909
 

2785
01:19:22,599 --> 01:19:31,150
 there will be three case studies about

2786
01:19:26,899 --> 01:19:31,150
 

2787
01:19:26,909 --> 01:19:35,019
 the policy learning using ring foster

2788
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:35,019
 

2789
01:19:31,150 --> 01:19:38,110
 and then you approach okay I'll give a

2790
01:19:35,009 --> 01:19:38,110
 

2791
01:19:35,019 --> 01:19:40,419
 quick overview then I was switched to

2792
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:40,419
 

2793
01:19:38,110 --> 01:19:43,749
 the next topic which will gonna be the

2794
01:19:40,409 --> 01:19:43,749
 

2795
01:19:40,419 --> 01:19:46,239
 last topic of my part this case three

2796
01:19:43,739 --> 01:19:46,239
 

2797
01:19:43,749 --> 01:19:49,689
 key studies in this Chris three key

2798
01:19:46,229 --> 01:19:49,689
 

2799
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:53,079
 studies we investigate how to

2800
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:53,079
 

2801
01:19:49,689 --> 01:19:57,820
 effectively explore the state action

2802
01:19:53,069 --> 01:19:57,820
 

2803
01:19:53,079 --> 01:19:59,769
 space the key idea is if you can measure

2804
01:19:57,810 --> 01:19:59,769
 

2805
01:19:57,820 --> 01:20:02,229
 the model uncertainty you know how to

2806
01:19:59,759 --> 01:20:02,229
 

2807
01:19:59,769 --> 01:20:04,650
 explore you always explore the places

2808
01:20:02,219 --> 01:20:04,650
 

2809
01:20:02,229 --> 01:20:08,260
 where the model is uncertain about

2810
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:08,260
 

2811
01:20:04,650 --> 01:20:10,840
 second is about how to decompose the

2812
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:10,840
 

2813
01:20:08,260 --> 01:20:14,469
 compressed state action space into

2814
01:20:10,830 --> 01:20:14,469
 

2815
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:17,019
 service spaces the idea is to leverage

2816
01:20:14,459 --> 01:20:17,019
 

2817
01:20:14,469 --> 01:20:19,090
 for our keiko alingas learning it's not

2818
01:20:17,009 --> 01:20:19,090
 

2819
01:20:17,019 --> 01:20:22,179
 just like a showers I just described my

2820
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:22,179
 

2821
01:20:19,090 --> 01:20:25,090
 choice as hierarchical Tyrell policy

2822
01:20:22,169 --> 01:20:25,090
 

2823
01:20:22,179 --> 01:20:30,189
 where the high-level policy can choose

2824
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:30,189
 

2825
01:20:25,090 --> 01:20:35,320
 which specific set of skills to activate

2826
01:20:30,179 --> 01:20:35,320
 

2827
01:20:30,189 --> 01:20:38,590
 whether low neighbor policy decide what

2828
01:20:35,310 --> 01:20:38,590
 

2829
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:42,239
 the actual action to take to accomplish

2830
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:42,239
 

2831
01:20:38,590 --> 01:20:45,130
 the task yes this is about the

2832
01:20:42,229 --> 01:20:45,130
 

2833
01:20:42,239 --> 01:20:47,469
 hierarchical reinforcement learning and

2834
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:47,469
 

2835
01:20:45,130 --> 01:20:50,650
 how to apply it to dialogue and this

2836
01:20:47,459 --> 01:20:50,650
 

2837
01:20:47,469 --> 01:20:54,579
 last wing is the integration of training

2838
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:54,579
 

2839
01:20:50,650 --> 01:20:58,239
 and policy and Annie so I think last

2840
01:20:54,569 --> 01:20:58,239
 

2841
01:20:54,579 --> 01:21:01,419
 piece what is relatively new we have a

2842
01:20:58,229 --> 01:21:01,419
 

2843
01:20:58,239 --> 01:21:05,619
 upcoming ACA paper about this and we

2844
01:21:01,409 --> 01:21:05,619
 

2845
01:21:01,419 --> 01:21:08,169
 also work with other research teams to

2846
01:21:05,609 --> 01:21:08,169
 

2847
01:21:05,619 --> 01:21:12,809
 explore new approaches so I are going to

2848
01:21:08,159 --> 01:21:12,809
 

2849
01:21:08,169 --> 01:21:19,269
 give some time to the last one I mean

2850
01:21:12,799 --> 01:21:19,269
 

2851
01:21:12,809 --> 01:21:21,459
 skip this to okay that's why the typical

2852
01:21:19,259 --> 01:21:21,459
 

2853
01:21:19,269 --> 01:21:25,660
 way of doing policy reinforce learning

2854
01:21:21,449 --> 01:21:25,660
 

2855
01:21:21,459 --> 01:21:28,060
 there okay we start from Sun you

2856
01:21:25,650 --> 01:21:28,060
 

2857
01:21:25,660 --> 01:21:31,600
 human conversation data and we can

2858
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:31,600
 

2859
01:21:28,060 --> 01:21:34,770
 always crack some data then after we

2860
01:21:31,590 --> 01:21:34,770
 

2861
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:37,690
 tread data we first software like a

2862
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:37,690
 

2863
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:40,300
 terrible policy using supervise the

2864
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:40,300
 

2865
01:21:37,690 --> 01:21:42,070
 nanny remand this is crucial for

2866
01:21:40,290 --> 01:21:42,070
 

2867
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:45,270
 reinforced learning in the later stage

2868
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:45,270
 

2869
01:21:42,070 --> 01:21:50,230
 because if you start with a random

2870
01:21:45,260 --> 01:21:50,230
 

2871
01:21:45,270 --> 01:21:54,370
 policy you have very low chance to get

2872
01:21:50,220 --> 01:21:54,370
 

2873
01:21:50,230 --> 01:21:58,120
 even one positive example you can rent a

2874
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:58,120
 

2875
01:21:54,370 --> 01:22:00,880
 tarot aging a million of times probably

2876
01:21:58,110 --> 01:22:00,880
 

2877
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:02,860
 your lucky cat will successful Terrence

2878
01:22:00,870 --> 01:22:02,860
 

2879
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:05,950
 it's almost impossible so you always

2880
01:22:02,850 --> 01:22:05,950
 

2881
01:22:02,860 --> 01:22:08,200
 need to start with a title policy which

2882
01:22:05,940 --> 01:22:08,200
 

2883
01:22:05,950 --> 01:22:10,540
 is readable that's why it's crucial to

2884
01:22:08,190 --> 01:22:10,540
 

2885
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:13,720
 have some human human country data to

2886
01:22:10,530 --> 01:22:13,720
 

2887
01:22:10,540 --> 01:22:17,020
 Stowers then after you build at the tale

2888
01:22:13,710 --> 01:22:17,020
 

2889
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:20,650
 of agent you turn the agent against the

2890
01:22:17,010 --> 01:22:20,650
 

2891
01:22:17,020 --> 01:22:21,370
 real user directly this is a typical way

2892
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:21,370
 

2893
01:22:20,650 --> 01:22:24,180
 of doing that

2894
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:24,180
 

2895
01:22:21,370 --> 01:22:27,310
 the problem is that it's very expensive

2896
01:22:24,170 --> 01:22:27,310
 

2897
01:22:24,180 --> 01:22:29,530
 because in order to try that arrow Asia

2898
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:29,530
 

2899
01:22:27,310 --> 01:22:33,010
 you need a lot of interactions between

2900
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:33,010
 

2901
01:22:29,530 --> 01:22:36,220
 the user and the dialogue and there's

2902
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,220
 

2903
01:22:33,010 --> 01:22:38,770
 risk that the user you will traverse a

2904
01:22:36,210 --> 01:22:38,770
 

2905
01:22:36,220 --> 01:22:42,010
 way if the initial terrible system is

2906
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:42,010
 

2907
01:22:38,770 --> 01:22:45,910
 not there so as I mentioned the other

2908
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,910
 

2909
01:22:42,010 --> 01:22:49,630
 day in many maps before we the product

2910
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:49,630
 

2911
01:22:45,910 --> 01:22:53,890
 system to reuse us we build a simulated

2912
01:22:49,620 --> 01:22:53,890
 

2913
01:22:49,630 --> 01:22:56,560
 user previous simulator user so after

2914
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:56,560
 

2915
01:22:53,890 --> 01:22:59,200
 the simulated user can also be developed

2916
01:22:56,550 --> 01:22:59,200
 

2917
01:22:56,560 --> 01:23:03,280
 using the human human compensation data

2918
01:22:59,190 --> 01:23:03,280
 

2919
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:06,580
 in the sense that the terror mimic the

2920
01:23:03,270 --> 01:23:06,580
 

2921
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:09,490
 aging part of the human incarnation ADA

2922
01:23:06,570 --> 01:23:09,490
 

2923
01:23:06,580 --> 01:23:11,590
 why the user mimicking the user part of

2924
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:11,590
 

2925
01:23:09,490 --> 01:23:16,420
 the human human conversation data and

2926
01:23:11,580 --> 01:23:16,420
 

2927
01:23:11,590 --> 01:23:18,940
 because the task is a veritable weight

2928
01:23:16,410 --> 01:23:18,940
 

2929
01:23:16,420 --> 01:23:21,460
 apply you can even build a rule-based

2930
01:23:18,930 --> 01:23:21,460
 

2931
01:23:18,940 --> 01:23:26,220
 system and to construct

2932
01:23:21,450 --> 01:23:26,220
 

2933
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:28,440
 pretty reasonable simulator users the

2934
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:28,440
 

2935
01:23:26,220 --> 01:23:31,240
 advantages of course it's very

2936
01:23:28,430 --> 01:23:31,240
 

2937
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:35,230
 inexpensive but the problem is over

2938
01:23:31,230 --> 01:23:35,230
 

2939
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:37,420
 fitting because you have no cost you can

2940
01:23:35,220 --> 01:23:37,420
 

2941
01:23:35,230 --> 01:23:39,519
 talk with similar to user millions of

2942
01:23:37,410 --> 01:23:39,519
 

2943
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:42,309
 times you can create

2944
01:23:39,509 --> 01:23:42,309
 

2945
01:23:39,519 --> 01:23:44,170
 biddings of Sderot sashes with the

2946
01:23:42,299 --> 01:23:44,170
 

2947
01:23:42,309 --> 01:23:46,900
 similar to user and the tarot aging

2948
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:46,900
 

2949
01:23:44,170 --> 01:23:49,300
 quickly all fit to the similarity users

2950
01:23:46,890 --> 01:23:49,300
 

2951
01:23:46,900 --> 01:23:51,340
 because there's always that discrepancy

2952
01:23:49,290 --> 01:23:51,340
 

2953
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:54,309
 between the similarity user in the real

2954
01:23:51,330 --> 01:23:54,309
 

2955
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:58,510
 users and all affiliate title agent is

2956
01:23:54,299 --> 01:23:58,510
 

2957
01:23:54,309 --> 01:24:03,849
 not going to work in real life so the

2958
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:03,849
 

2959
01:23:58,510 --> 01:24:07,360
 idea is we use posts start from human

2960
01:24:03,839 --> 01:24:07,360
 

2961
01:24:03,849 --> 01:24:09,429
 human composition data we build initial

2962
01:24:07,350 --> 01:24:09,429
 

2963
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:11,650
 title agent using imitation menu and

2964
01:24:09,419 --> 01:24:11,650
 

2965
01:24:09,429 --> 01:24:15,400
 then we also build a similar to user

2966
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:15,400
 

2967
01:24:11,650 --> 01:24:19,269
 using supervisor writing then we try to

2968
01:24:15,390 --> 01:24:19,269
 

2969
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:21,820
 use the simulated user as much as you we

2970
01:24:19,259 --> 01:24:21,820
 

2971
01:24:19,269 --> 01:24:25,090
 care because it's cheap the similar view

2972
01:24:21,810 --> 01:24:25,090
 

2973
01:24:21,820 --> 01:24:28,539
 the generated simulated experience then

2974
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:28,539
 

2975
01:24:25,090 --> 01:24:32,079
 you add another discriminator that I did

2976
01:24:28,529 --> 01:24:32,079
 

2977
01:24:28,539 --> 01:24:33,989
 from again similar to game whether we

2978
01:24:32,069 --> 01:24:33,989
 

2979
01:24:32,079 --> 01:24:37,119
 need to switch to the real user or not

2980
01:24:33,979 --> 01:24:37,119
 

2981
01:24:33,989 --> 01:24:39,249
 this is could be a binary classifier or

2982
01:24:37,109 --> 01:24:39,249
 

2983
01:24:37,119 --> 01:24:43,119
 whether the similarity experience is a

2984
01:24:39,239 --> 01:24:43,119
 

2985
01:24:39,249 --> 01:24:45,639
 look like a real what's effect if say

2986
01:24:43,109 --> 01:24:45,639
 

2987
01:24:43,119 --> 01:24:47,920
 now I don't need to switch to the real

2988
01:24:45,629 --> 01:24:47,920
 

2989
01:24:45,639 --> 01:24:51,579
 user then you can just use the similar

2990
01:24:47,910 --> 01:24:51,579
 

2991
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:56,380
 to users experience to input the title

2992
01:24:51,569 --> 01:24:56,380
 

2993
01:24:51,579 --> 01:25:00,280
 agent but if in the cases yes rising in

2994
01:24:56,370 --> 01:25:00,280
 

2995
01:24:56,380 --> 01:25:02,710
 this particular action states space the

2996
01:25:00,270 --> 01:25:02,710
 

2997
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:05,320
 sonority user is no word trend at all so

2998
01:25:02,700 --> 01:25:05,320
 

2999
01:25:02,710 --> 01:25:07,719
 its behavior is dramatically different

3000
01:25:05,310 --> 01:25:07,719
 

3001
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:10,659
 from the real user now I need to switch

3002
01:25:07,709 --> 01:25:10,659
 

3003
01:25:07,719 --> 01:25:13,119
 to the reviews when we switch to the

3004
01:25:10,649 --> 01:25:13,119
 

3005
01:25:10,659 --> 01:25:17,079
 real user then the real user will

3006
01:25:13,109 --> 01:25:17,079
 

3007
01:25:13,119 --> 01:25:19,719
 generate some real experience then this

3008
01:25:17,069 --> 01:25:19,719
 

3009
01:25:17,079 --> 01:25:23,949
 real experience can be used to improve

3010
01:25:19,709 --> 01:25:23,949
 

3011
01:25:19,719 --> 01:25:27,760
 the simulator or improved the title

3012
01:25:23,939 --> 01:25:27,760
 

3013
01:25:23,949 --> 01:25:30,579
 agent but this can also be used to

3014
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:30,579
 

3015
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:33,449
 improve the discriminator and the

3016
01:25:30,569 --> 01:25:33,449
 

3017
01:25:30,579 --> 01:25:38,469
 simulator user in this case we see that

3018
01:25:33,439 --> 01:25:38,469
 

3019
01:25:33,449 --> 01:25:40,800
 the key idea here is to make the best of

3020
01:25:38,459 --> 01:25:40,800
 

3021
01:25:38,469 --> 01:25:44,860
 the very limited

3022
01:25:40,790 --> 01:25:44,860
 

3023
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:47,800
 expensive real user experience in this

3024
01:25:44,850 --> 01:25:47,800
 

3025
01:25:44,860 --> 01:25:51,749
 case the real user experience is used

3026
01:25:47,790 --> 01:25:51,749
 

3027
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:53,809
 for three purpose improve the agent

3028
01:25:51,739 --> 01:25:53,809
 

3029
01:25:51,749 --> 01:25:56,809
 improved

3030
01:25:53,799 --> 01:25:56,809
 

3031
01:25:53,809 --> 01:26:00,440
 and they improve the simulator user okay

3032
01:25:56,799 --> 01:26:00,440
 

3033
01:25:56,809 --> 01:26:03,559
 this combines this approach combines the

3034
01:26:00,430 --> 01:26:03,559
 

3035
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:09,340
 real user and the simulator user for

3036
01:26:03,549 --> 01:26:09,340
 

3037
01:26:03,559 --> 01:26:11,960
 data policy learning when we learn the

3038
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:11,960
 

3039
01:26:09,340 --> 01:26:13,420
 dialogue aging using the similar to you

3040
01:26:11,950 --> 01:26:13,420
 

3041
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:17,329
 that we call this machine learning

3042
01:26:13,410 --> 01:26:17,329
 

3043
01:26:13,420 --> 01:26:20,030
 but if we improve that arrow aging using

3044
01:26:17,319 --> 01:26:20,030
 

3045
01:26:17,329 --> 01:26:21,860
 the real user experience sometimes we

3046
01:26:20,020 --> 01:26:21,860
 

3047
01:26:20,030 --> 01:26:24,889
 call this machine vision because these

3048
01:26:21,850 --> 01:26:24,889
 

3049
01:26:21,860 --> 01:26:29,599
 examples are feet effect by the pad by

3050
01:26:24,879 --> 01:26:29,599
 

3051
01:26:24,889 --> 01:26:31,699
 the real user okay so to summarize or

3052
01:26:29,589 --> 01:26:31,699
 

3053
01:26:29,599 --> 01:26:35,000
 see that there are different ways of

3054
01:26:31,689 --> 01:26:35,000
 

3055
01:26:31,699 --> 01:26:36,679
 building dialogues okay in other days

3056
01:26:34,990 --> 01:26:36,679
 

3057
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:40,989
 almost 20 years ago

3058
01:26:36,669 --> 01:26:40,989
 

3059
01:26:36,679 --> 01:26:44,599
 I think sudhi is going MIT team did this

3060
01:26:40,979 --> 01:26:44,599
 

3061
01:26:40,989 --> 01:26:48,679
 airline booking and terrible season is

3062
01:26:44,589 --> 01:26:48,679
 

3063
01:26:44,599 --> 01:26:52,309
 married they start from the program okay

3064
01:26:48,669 --> 01:26:52,309
 

3065
01:26:48,679 --> 01:26:56,210
 you need to program everything which is

3066
01:26:52,299 --> 01:26:56,210
 

3067
01:26:52,309 --> 01:27:00,050
 really hard for non-experts very hard to

3068
01:26:56,200 --> 01:27:00,050
 

3069
01:26:56,210 --> 01:27:03,409
 table it's not even comprehensible for

3070
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:03,409
 

3071
01:27:00,050 --> 01:27:06,230
 outsider then people switch from the

3072
01:27:03,399 --> 01:27:06,230
 

3073
01:27:03,409 --> 01:27:08,780
 program to decorate kill the system

3074
01:27:06,220 --> 01:27:08,780
 

3075
01:27:06,230 --> 01:27:11,599
 meaning that instead of writing the

3076
01:27:08,770 --> 01:27:11,599
 

3077
01:27:08,780 --> 01:27:14,690
 program directory you you draw me the

3078
01:27:11,589 --> 01:27:14,690
 

3079
01:27:11,599 --> 01:27:16,849
 dialogue a charter it's like a finite

3080
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:16,849
 

3081
01:27:14,690 --> 01:27:21,429
 state machine you know you give me the

3082
01:27:16,839 --> 01:27:21,429
 

3083
01:27:16,849 --> 01:27:26,059
 state and specify other states transform

3084
01:27:21,419 --> 01:27:26,059
 

3085
01:27:21,429 --> 01:27:30,469
 from one to the other based on what

3086
01:27:26,049 --> 01:27:30,469
 

3087
01:27:26,059 --> 01:27:35,329
 actions okay so I think these days even

3088
01:27:30,459 --> 01:27:35,329
 

3089
01:27:30,469 --> 01:27:39,800
 could Google Facebook Microsoft and and

3090
01:27:35,319 --> 01:27:39,800
 

3091
01:27:35,329 --> 01:27:43,070
 Amazon we open source and dialog systems

3092
01:27:39,790 --> 01:27:43,070
 

3093
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:46,820
 based on the base of this this is a

3094
01:27:43,060 --> 01:27:46,820
 

3095
01:27:43,070 --> 01:27:49,550
 relatively easy form now experts to

3096
01:27:46,810 --> 01:27:49,550
 

3097
01:27:46,820 --> 01:27:53,750
 develop angels because a large in New

3098
01:27:49,540 --> 01:27:53,750
 

3099
01:27:49,550 --> 01:27:56,599
 York where you can draw the sea and the

3100
01:27:53,740 --> 01:27:56,599
 

3101
01:27:53,750 --> 01:28:00,980
 system that who's will help you to

3102
01:27:56,589 --> 01:28:00,980
 

3103
01:27:56,599 --> 01:28:03,920
 convert this into some program okay but

3104
01:28:00,970 --> 01:28:03,920
 

3105
01:28:00,980 --> 01:28:05,989
 the ideal case are that no idea is the

3106
01:28:03,910 --> 01:28:05,989
 

3107
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:07,400
 reason why we believe that are in many

3108
01:28:05,979 --> 01:28:07,400
 

3109
01:28:05,989 --> 01:28:11,630
 case we have the

3110
01:28:07,390 --> 01:28:11,630
 

3111
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:15,260
 can we use motion on you to do that this

3112
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:15,260
 

3113
01:28:11,630 --> 01:28:18,430
 is not only accessible to now Express

3114
01:28:15,250 --> 01:28:18,430
 

3115
01:28:15,260 --> 01:28:21,860
 but easy to debug but the problems we

3116
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:21,860
 

3117
01:28:18,430 --> 01:28:23,510
 need some sample Dominator and there

3118
01:28:21,850 --> 01:28:23,510
 

3119
01:28:21,860 --> 01:28:28,280
 could be tons of different Dominator

3120
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:28,280
 

3121
01:28:23,510 --> 01:28:32,650
 what ADA to collect is a question so

3122
01:28:28,270 --> 01:28:32,650
 

3123
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:38,650
 eventually we notice that okay sorry

3124
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:38,650
 

3125
01:28:32,650 --> 01:28:38,650
 there's no solution that can fit all

3126
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:39,720
 

3127
01:28:39,730 --> 01:28:45,320
 that motivates us to build a new set of

3128
01:28:42,850 --> 01:28:45,320
 

3129
01:28:42,860 --> 01:28:50,020
 tools for teller building called

3130
01:28:45,310 --> 01:28:50,020
 

3131
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:53,330
 conversational lender the idea is to

3132
01:28:50,010 --> 01:28:53,330
 

3133
01:28:50,020 --> 01:28:55,850
 take the advantage and make the best of

3134
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:55,850
 

3135
01:28:53,330 --> 01:28:58,340
 both world we can start from what we can

3136
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:58,340
 

3137
01:28:55,850 --> 01:29:01,250
 start with the rule based policy and the

3138
01:28:58,330 --> 01:29:01,250
 

3139
01:28:58,340 --> 01:29:03,410
 groom with motion and their ideas and we

3140
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:03,410
 

3141
01:29:01,250 --> 01:29:05,110
 kind of make but also we need to make

3142
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:05,110
 

3143
01:29:03,410 --> 01:29:15,950
 the machine learning more control by

3144
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:15,950
 

3145
01:29:05,110 --> 01:29:18,080
 visualization yeah I think I don't know

3146
01:29:15,940 --> 01:29:18,080
 

3147
01:29:15,950 --> 01:29:20,540
 whether I can shoe this okay I don't

3148
01:29:18,070 --> 01:29:20,540
 

3149
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:24,770
 have a internet how about this I just

3150
01:29:20,530 --> 01:29:24,770
 

3151
01:29:20,540 --> 01:29:26,990
 show you this almost last rise the

3152
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:26,990
 

3153
01:29:24,770 --> 01:29:29,750
 conversation under is it's an open

3154
01:29:26,980 --> 01:29:29,750
 

3155
01:29:26,990 --> 01:29:33,290
 source together we developed for the

3156
01:29:29,740 --> 01:29:33,290
 

3157
01:29:29,750 --> 01:29:35,800
 industry and try to provide you in

3158
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:35,800
 

3159
01:29:33,290 --> 01:29:40,730
 environment so that you can build apart

3160
01:29:35,790 --> 01:29:40,730
 

3161
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:44,330
 interactively by using examples here is

3162
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:44,330
 

3163
01:29:40,730 --> 01:29:49,040
 the user interface of the of the

3164
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:49,040
 

3165
01:29:44,330 --> 01:29:51,710
 conditioner from hope remember the key

3166
01:29:49,030 --> 01:29:51,710
 

3167
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:55,520
 idea the key task of building board is

3168
01:29:51,700 --> 01:29:55,520
 

3169
01:29:51,710 --> 01:29:58,610
 to specify in what context how to

3170
01:29:55,510 --> 01:29:58,610
 

3171
01:29:55,520 --> 01:30:01,850
 respond about how to respond so this

3172
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:01,850
 

3173
01:29:58,610 --> 01:30:04,400
 interface allow you to specify or teach

3174
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:04,400
 

3175
01:30:01,850 --> 01:30:07,370
 the bot how to respond at each different

3176
01:30:04,390 --> 01:30:07,370
 

3177
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:10,480
 stage and the the underlying machine

3178
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:10,480
 

3179
01:30:07,370 --> 01:30:13,960
 learning engine we crossed the response

3180
01:30:10,470 --> 01:30:13,960
 

3181
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:18,420
 you specified in two different actions

3182
01:30:13,950 --> 01:30:18,420
 

3183
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:20,970
 from hadouken response

3184
01:30:18,410 --> 01:30:20,970
 

3185
01:30:18,420 --> 01:30:23,760
 differently even with the same action

3186
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:23,760
 

3187
01:30:20,970 --> 01:30:25,560
 the die action you say say say hi to the

3188
01:30:23,750 --> 01:30:25,560
 

3189
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:27,660
 user you say hi good morning good

3190
01:30:25,550 --> 01:30:27,660
 

3191
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:31,590
 afternoon fine thank you how about you

3192
01:30:27,650 --> 01:30:31,590
 

3193
01:30:27,660 --> 01:30:34,950
 how are you and all this mathematically

3194
01:30:31,580 --> 01:30:34,950
 

3195
01:30:31,590 --> 01:30:37,170
 maps to one action right creating the

3196
01:30:34,940 --> 01:30:37,170
 

3197
01:30:34,950 --> 01:30:40,740
 user so the underlying engine whether

3198
01:30:37,160 --> 01:30:40,740
 

3199
01:30:37,170 --> 01:30:45,990
 learn how to group different a response

3200
01:30:40,730 --> 01:30:45,990
 

3201
01:30:40,740 --> 01:30:50,280
 the teacher told you the agent to do in

3202
01:30:45,980 --> 01:30:50,280
 

3203
01:30:45,990 --> 01:30:52,920
 through one specific actions and you can

3204
01:30:50,270 --> 01:30:52,920
 

3205
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:56,580
 correct mistakes listen if you specify

3206
01:30:52,910 --> 01:30:56,580
 

3207
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:59,720
 the user how to specify and you tear the

3208
01:30:56,570 --> 01:30:59,720
 

3209
01:30:56,580 --> 01:31:03,270
 the age you how to respond at a

3210
01:30:59,710 --> 01:31:03,270
 

3211
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:05,790
 particular contest next time you have to

3212
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:05,790
 

3213
01:31:03,270 --> 01:31:08,700
 contest the switch a change a little bit

3214
01:31:05,780 --> 01:31:08,700
 

3215
01:31:05,790 --> 01:31:12,120
 you believe the agents response is not

3216
01:31:08,690 --> 01:31:12,120
 

3217
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:14,310
 correct then you correct it then the

3218
01:31:12,110 --> 01:31:14,310
 

3219
01:31:12,120 --> 01:31:17,870
 underlying machine learning model will

3220
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:17,870
 

3221
01:31:14,310 --> 01:31:21,030
 figure out whether the correction end up

3222
01:31:17,860 --> 01:31:21,030
 

3223
01:31:17,870 --> 01:31:23,720
 adding a new action what's the same

3224
01:31:21,020 --> 01:31:23,720
 

3225
01:31:21,030 --> 01:31:27,950
 action but just just different form

3226
01:31:23,710 --> 01:31:27,950
 

3227
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:31,170
 eventually I I think we already tested

3228
01:31:27,940 --> 01:31:31,170
 

3229
01:31:27,950 --> 01:31:32,910
 against the 50 different customers in

3230
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:32,910
 

3231
01:31:31,170 --> 01:31:34,980
 industry or natal very positive

3232
01:31:32,900 --> 01:31:34,980
 

3233
01:31:32,910 --> 01:31:37,400
 feedbacks and you can download the

3234
01:31:34,970 --> 01:31:37,400
 

3235
01:31:34,980 --> 01:31:41,850
 slides and the click of this link it's

3236
01:31:37,390 --> 01:31:41,850
 

3237
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:44,400
 the link lead you to a five minute

3238
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:44,400
 

3239
01:31:41,850 --> 01:31:47,040
 tutorial goes through example how you

3240
01:31:44,390 --> 01:31:47,040
 

3241
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:51,210
 build a tariff system using consensual

3242
01:31:47,030 --> 01:31:51,210
 

3243
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:54,180
 manner and for the research community we

3244
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:54,180
 

3245
01:31:51,210 --> 01:31:57,630
 also create a lot of tools existing

3246
01:31:54,170 --> 01:31:57,630
 

3247
01:31:54,180 --> 01:32:00,530
 tools and attach to the map into a

3248
01:31:57,620 --> 01:32:00,530
 

3249
01:31:57,630 --> 01:32:03,600
 software package called cover lab

3250
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:03,600
 

3251
01:32:00,530 --> 01:32:06,950
 sangjung D is the beating therefore that

3252
01:32:03,590 --> 01:32:06,950
 

3253
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:09,690
 Microsoft he he told me he already

3254
01:32:06,940 --> 01:32:09,690
 

3255
01:32:06,950 --> 01:32:11,940
 released letter paper but not a coding

3256
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:11,940
 

3257
01:32:09,690 --> 01:32:15,810
 yet I hope the color will come out in

3258
01:32:11,930 --> 01:32:15,810
 

3259
01:32:11,940 --> 01:32:21,230
 about a month that's the end of my

3260
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:21,230
 

3261
01:32:15,810 --> 01:32:21,230
 session okay thank you

3262
01:32:24,930 --> 01:32:24,930
 

3263
01:32:24,940 --> 01:32:39,730
 I have questions oh we can discuss after

3264
01:32:30,459 --> 01:32:39,730
 

3265
01:32:30,469 --> 01:32:43,250
 vicious pot okay thank you okay yeah

3266
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:43,250
 

3267
01:32:39,730 --> 01:32:47,090
 hello everyone so my part will cover two

3268
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:47,090
 

3269
01:32:43,250 --> 01:32:49,010
 two aspects first is on building fully

3270
01:32:47,080 --> 01:32:49,010
 

3271
01:32:47,090 --> 01:32:50,450
 end-to-end dialogue systems and the

3272
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,450
 

3273
01:32:49,010 --> 01:32:54,530
 other is chatbots

3274
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:54,530
 

3275
01:32:50,450 --> 01:32:56,960
 and and please interrupt me in the

3276
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:56,960
 

3277
01:32:54,530 --> 01:32:58,880
 middle if you have any questions but so

3278
01:32:56,950 --> 01:32:58,880
 

3279
01:32:56,960 --> 01:33:00,620
 the motivation here is like as jangbang

3280
01:32:58,870 --> 01:33:00,620
 

3281
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:04,120
 was mentioning before i love earlier

3282
01:33:00,610 --> 01:33:04,120
 

3283
01:33:00,620 --> 01:33:06,890
 work in dialogue and this goes back to

3284
01:33:04,110 --> 01:33:06,890
 

3285
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:08,600
 several decades has has different

3286
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:08,600
 

3287
01:33:06,890 --> 01:33:10,880
 components typically many different

3288
01:33:08,590 --> 01:33:10,880
 

3289
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:13,969
 commands can get kind of fairly

3290
01:33:10,870 --> 01:33:13,969
 

3291
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:15,560
 architecture systems and like but at the

3292
01:33:13,959 --> 01:33:15,560
 

3293
01:33:13,969 --> 01:33:17,090
 core it would be typically at least four

3294
01:33:15,550 --> 01:33:17,090
 

3295
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:18,590
 components where one is the

3296
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:18,590
 

3297
01:33:17,090 --> 01:33:21,500
 understanding component we have a

3298
01:33:18,580 --> 01:33:21,500
 

3299
01:33:18,590 --> 01:33:22,850
 generation component and between the two

3300
01:33:21,490 --> 01:33:22,850
 

3301
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:26,600
 there would be a dialogue stay tracker

3302
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:26,600
 

3303
01:33:22,850 --> 01:33:28,340
 and the look response selection but like

3304
01:33:26,590 --> 01:33:28,340
 

3305
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:31,400
 several years ago like the question was

3306
01:33:28,330 --> 01:33:31,400
 

3307
01:33:28,340 --> 01:33:33,110
 well can we do away from having these

3308
01:33:31,390 --> 01:33:33,110
 

3309
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:36,710
 different component and having one

3310
01:33:33,100 --> 01:33:36,710
 

3311
01:33:33,110 --> 01:33:39,170
 single unified model that but covers

3312
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:39,170
 

3313
01:33:36,710 --> 01:33:40,820
 everything and that kind of represent

3314
01:33:39,160 --> 01:33:40,820
 

3315
01:33:39,170 --> 01:33:45,230
 but has everything between input and

3316
01:33:40,810 --> 01:33:45,230
 

3317
01:33:40,820 --> 01:33:46,460
 output be only in a latent space and so

3318
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:46,460
 

3319
01:33:45,230 --> 01:33:48,350
 you might ask how did it actually

3320
01:33:46,450 --> 01:33:48,350
 

3321
01:33:46,460 --> 01:33:50,540
 connect with the other aspect to this

3322
01:33:48,340 --> 01:33:50,540
 

3323
01:33:48,350 --> 01:33:53,060
 obvious part of a tutorial which is

3324
01:33:50,530 --> 01:33:53,060
 

3325
01:33:50,540 --> 01:33:58,040
 about social BOTS and chat BOTS well I

3326
01:33:53,050 --> 01:33:58,040
 

3327
01:33:53,060 --> 01:33:59,360
 mean it's it's a V era where visually

3328
01:33:58,030 --> 01:33:59,360
 

3329
01:33:58,040 --> 01:34:03,140
 and - and sister have been the most

3330
01:33:59,350 --> 01:34:03,140
 

3331
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:05,239
 successful is one where that has to live

3332
01:34:03,130 --> 01:34:05,239
 

3333
01:34:03,140 --> 01:34:07,400
 with more informal chat like chat BOTS

3334
01:34:05,229 --> 01:34:07,400
 

3335
01:34:05,239 --> 01:34:09,800
 and it has been popular I mean as

3336
01:34:07,390 --> 01:34:09,800
 

3337
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:12,980
 Jennifer was mentioning like out where

3338
01:34:09,790 --> 01:34:12,980
 

3339
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:16,969
 some crucial systems but also the other

3340
01:34:12,970 --> 01:34:16,969
 

3341
01:34:12,980 --> 01:34:19,430
 aspect is yeah it's also kind of very

3342
01:34:16,959 --> 01:34:19,430
 

3343
01:34:16,969 --> 01:34:21,080
 kind of useful so social BOTS it's nice

3344
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:21,080
 

3345
01:34:19,430 --> 01:34:22,550
 to think about because people think well

3346
01:34:21,070 --> 01:34:22,550
 

3347
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:25,790
 chat BOTS maybe it's not very useful

3348
01:34:22,540 --> 01:34:25,790
 

3349
01:34:22,550 --> 01:34:28,580
 it's kind of a mess to chat but well it

3350
01:34:25,780 --> 01:34:28,580
 

3351
01:34:25,790 --> 01:34:31,250
 helps with maximizing your user

3352
01:34:28,570 --> 01:34:31,250
 

3353
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:32,240
 engagement also help in a way to cope

3354
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:32,240
 

3355
01:34:31,250 --> 01:34:34,310
 with use

3356
01:34:32,230 --> 01:34:34,310
 

3357
01:34:32,240 --> 01:34:36,860
 frustration when maybe the system it was

3358
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:36,860
 

3359
01:34:34,310 --> 01:34:40,850
 a task-oriented Dalek system is not able

3360
01:34:36,850 --> 01:34:40,850
 

3361
01:34:36,860 --> 01:34:44,510
 to handle well certain queries when

3362
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:44,510
 

3363
01:34:40,850 --> 01:34:47,000
 maybe a better engagement with the bot

3364
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:47,000
 

3365
01:34:44,510 --> 01:34:48,980
 can actually improve the experience at

3366
01:34:46,990 --> 01:34:48,980
 

3367
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:50,930
 all so I think the the last aspect

3368
01:34:48,970 --> 01:34:50,930
 

3369
01:34:48,980 --> 01:34:55,280
 higher here but I haven't was slide

3370
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:55,280
 

3371
01:34:50,930 --> 01:34:56,810
 influenced a Dalek research so so social

3372
01:34:55,270 --> 01:34:56,810
 

3373
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:58,910
 bot has been organized playground for

3374
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:58,910
 

3375
01:34:56,810 --> 01:35:00,620
 people to can experiment with end-to-end

3376
01:34:58,900 --> 01:35:00,620
 

3377
01:34:58,910 --> 01:35:03,740
 approach that I'm going to be talking

3378
01:35:00,610 --> 01:35:03,740
 

3379
01:35:00,620 --> 01:35:05,210
 about in this part where you don't have

3380
01:35:03,730 --> 01:35:05,210
 

3381
01:35:03,740 --> 01:35:07,670
 to deal too much about kind of

3382
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:07,670
 

3383
01:35:05,210 --> 01:35:09,230
 interfacing with api's but in the way

3384
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:09,230
 

3385
01:35:07,670 --> 01:35:12,200
 but Jonathan was talking about because

3386
01:35:09,220 --> 01:35:12,200
 

3387
01:35:09,230 --> 01:35:14,270
 if you talking about chitchat then you

3388
01:35:12,190 --> 01:35:14,270
 

3389
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:18,140
 don't need maybe so much up to know

3390
01:35:14,260 --> 01:35:18,140
 

3391
01:35:14,270 --> 01:35:19,610
 about the outside world so and to give

3392
01:35:18,130 --> 01:35:19,610
 

3393
01:35:18,140 --> 01:35:23,810
 you a little bit of historical overview

3394
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:23,810
 

3395
01:35:19,610 --> 01:35:26,090
 so I mean a lot of work prior to 2010

3396
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:26,090
 

3397
01:35:23,810 --> 01:35:28,370
 was basically obvious more kind of

3398
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:28,370
 

3399
01:35:26,090 --> 01:35:31,190
 modular architecture who have different

3400
01:35:28,360 --> 01:35:31,190
 

3401
01:35:28,370 --> 01:35:33,860
 components and the first system but

3402
01:35:31,180 --> 01:35:33,860
 

3403
01:35:31,190 --> 01:35:36,110
 really fully data-driven came along

3404
01:35:33,850 --> 01:35:36,110
 

3405
01:35:33,860 --> 01:35:38,060
 around 2010 where maybe the first one

3406
01:35:36,100 --> 01:35:38,060
 

3407
01:35:36,110 --> 01:35:40,190
 was actually a IR based system were

3408
01:35:38,050 --> 01:35:40,190
 

3409
01:35:38,060 --> 01:35:42,170
 basically its end-to-end system but the

3410
01:35:40,180 --> 01:35:42,170
 

3411
01:35:40,190 --> 01:35:44,840
 output was always a retrieval response

3412
01:35:42,160 --> 01:35:44,840
 

3413
01:35:42,170 --> 01:35:47,660
 from large corpus and 2011 was the first

3414
01:35:44,830 --> 01:35:47,660
 

3415
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:49,460
 one really but was kind of Fujian - and

3416
01:35:47,650 --> 01:35:49,460
 

3417
01:35:47,660 --> 01:35:51,260
 yet not yet neural but it was actually

3418
01:35:49,450 --> 01:35:51,260
 

3419
01:35:49,460 --> 01:35:53,510
 using a machine translation approach but

3420
01:35:51,250 --> 01:35:53,510
 

3421
01:35:51,260 --> 01:35:56,930
 is actually inspired by phrase based

3422
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:56,930
 

3423
01:35:53,510 --> 01:35:59,570
 machine translation and it's around 2015

3424
01:35:56,920 --> 01:35:59,570
 

3425
01:35:56,930 --> 01:36:05,660
 where like there were different efforts

3426
01:35:59,560 --> 01:36:05,660
 

3427
01:35:59,570 --> 01:36:09,800
 to actually build a neural systems but

3428
01:36:05,650 --> 01:36:09,800
 

3429
01:36:05,660 --> 01:36:10,940
 we're fully end-to-end and so ok but you

3430
01:36:09,790 --> 01:36:10,940
 

3431
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:13,100
 have might have seen many of these

3432
01:36:10,930 --> 01:36:13,100
 

3433
01:36:10,940 --> 01:36:16,460
 similar slides so the idea is but

3434
01:36:13,090 --> 01:36:16,460
 

3435
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:19,730
 initially people we used sequence models

3436
01:36:16,450 --> 01:36:19,730
 

3437
01:36:16,460 --> 01:36:22,490
 and like lsdm based RNN based sequence

3438
01:36:19,720 --> 01:36:22,490
 

3439
01:36:19,730 --> 01:36:25,490
 models to model conversation that's not

3440
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:25,490
 

3441
01:36:22,490 --> 01:36:28,070
 unlike over tasks where like machine

3442
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:28,070
 

3443
01:36:25,490 --> 01:36:31,010
 translation or summarization or over any

3444
01:36:28,060 --> 01:36:31,010
 

3445
01:36:28,070 --> 01:36:32,930
 kind of generation tasks you might be

3446
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,930
 

3447
01:36:31,010 --> 01:36:36,680
 interested in so the same kind of model

3448
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:36,680
 

3449
01:36:32,930 --> 01:36:38,900
 have been very popularly using in tasks

3450
01:36:36,670 --> 01:36:38,900
 

3451
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:41,690
 for text language in and language out

3452
01:36:38,890 --> 01:36:41,690
 

3453
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:44,180
 have been also applied to dialogue and

3454
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:44,180
 

3455
01:36:41,690 --> 01:36:47,179
 I'm not going to be talking about the

3456
01:36:44,170 --> 01:36:47,179
 

3457
01:36:44,180 --> 01:36:49,460
 specific of these models because

3458
01:36:47,169 --> 01:36:49,460
 

3459
01:36:47,179 --> 01:36:52,639
 those are kind of the same as in this

3460
01:36:49,450 --> 01:36:52,639
 

3461
01:36:49,460 --> 01:36:54,260
 article like translation so what I'm

3462
01:36:52,629 --> 01:36:54,260
 

3463
01:36:52,639 --> 01:36:56,659
 going to be talking about it's like what

3464
01:36:54,250 --> 01:36:56,659
 

3465
01:36:54,260 --> 01:36:59,960
 specifically different between what has

3466
01:36:56,649 --> 01:36:59,960
 

3467
01:36:56,659 --> 01:37:05,210
 been done in said translation and what

3468
01:36:59,950 --> 01:37:05,210
 

3469
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:06,500
 has been done in dialogue so so and also

3470
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:06,500
 

3471
01:37:05,210 --> 01:37:08,570
 like where different models like this

3472
01:37:06,490 --> 01:37:08,570
 

3473
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:09,949
 I'm more recently has also been people

3474
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:09,949
 

3475
01:37:08,570 --> 01:37:11,989
 have been applying also the transform of

3476
01:37:09,939 --> 01:37:11,989
 

3477
01:37:09,949 --> 01:37:15,040
 our role and so on also even more recent

3478
01:37:11,979 --> 01:37:15,040
 

3479
01:37:11,989 --> 01:37:18,260
 techniques but the idea being that you

3480
01:37:15,030 --> 01:37:18,260
 

3481
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:20,989
 take as input the entire conversation

3482
01:37:18,250 --> 01:37:20,989
 

3483
01:37:18,260 --> 01:37:24,500
 history and the art was a generative

3484
01:37:20,979 --> 01:37:24,500
 

3485
01:37:20,989 --> 01:37:26,270
 response and it's well it's time to to

3486
01:37:24,490 --> 01:37:26,270
 

3487
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:28,429
 work creatively well but I'm gonna

3488
01:37:26,260 --> 01:37:28,429
 

3489
01:37:26,270 --> 01:37:30,800
 pinpoint certain issues but every to be

3490
01:37:28,419 --> 01:37:30,800
 

3491
01:37:28,429 --> 01:37:33,079
 specific to dialogue but also be before

3492
01:37:30,790 --> 01:37:33,079
 

3493
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:36,889
 I get to the issues specific to dialogue

3494
01:37:33,069 --> 01:37:36,889
 

3495
01:37:33,079 --> 01:37:38,510
 I want to kind of frame kind of these to

3496
01:37:36,879 --> 01:37:38,510
 

3497
01:37:36,889 --> 01:37:40,280
 show that was actually something but it

3498
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:40,280
 

3499
01:37:38,510 --> 01:37:41,869
 was very kind of makes it interesting to

3500
01:37:40,270 --> 01:37:41,869
 

3501
01:37:40,280 --> 01:37:44,030
 work with dialogue of visa model so the

3502
01:37:41,859 --> 01:37:44,030
 

3503
01:37:41,869 --> 01:37:46,460
 first one is the scale of the data so I

3504
01:37:44,020 --> 01:37:46,460
 

3505
01:37:44,030 --> 01:37:48,770
 mean if you of in over tasks typically

3506
01:37:46,450 --> 01:37:48,770
 

3507
01:37:46,460 --> 01:37:51,050
 but the amount of day is very bounded I

3508
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:51,050
 

3509
01:37:48,770 --> 01:37:54,110
 mean in transition people deal with

3510
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:54,110
 

3511
01:37:51,050 --> 01:37:57,020
 fairly large data set but here if you if

3512
01:37:54,100 --> 01:37:57,020
 

3513
01:37:54,110 --> 01:37:59,329
 you do like you build end-to-end system

3514
01:37:57,010 --> 01:37:59,329
 

3515
01:37:57,020 --> 01:38:02,030
 of let's say reddit or Twitter data to

3516
01:37:59,319 --> 01:38:02,030
 

3517
01:37:59,329 --> 01:38:04,369
 to build a conversation model these data

3518
01:38:02,020 --> 01:38:04,369
 

3519
01:38:02,030 --> 01:38:07,400
 set I yuge I mean think of Twitter I

3520
01:38:04,359 --> 01:38:07,400
 

3521
01:38:04,369 --> 01:38:09,889
 mean it's like they are like 34 million

3522
01:38:07,390 --> 01:38:09,889
 

3523
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:12,650
 monthly active users 5 million tweets

3524
01:38:09,879 --> 01:38:12,650
 

3525
01:38:09,889 --> 01:38:15,110
 per day is just so massively big that in

3526
01:38:12,640 --> 01:38:15,110
 

3527
01:38:12,650 --> 01:38:17,780
 practice but no amount of training data

3528
01:38:15,100 --> 01:38:17,780
 

3529
01:38:15,110 --> 01:38:20,239
 is unbounded so it makes kind of maybe

3530
01:38:17,770 --> 01:38:20,239
 

3531
01:38:17,780 --> 01:38:23,210
 people prefer lean towards more kind of

3532
01:38:20,229 --> 01:38:23,210
 

3533
01:38:20,239 --> 01:38:25,849
 firm models for our perhaps faster to

3534
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:25,849
 

3535
01:38:23,210 --> 01:38:28,309
 train and faster for inference and but

3536
01:38:25,839 --> 01:38:28,309
 

3537
01:38:25,849 --> 01:38:30,500
 maybe a subject has to be studied a bit

3538
01:38:28,299 --> 01:38:30,500
 

3539
01:38:28,309 --> 01:38:33,500
 more because there have been a lot of

3540
01:38:30,490 --> 01:38:33,500
 

3541
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:35,179
 focus like recently building more kind

3542
01:38:33,490 --> 01:38:35,179
 

3543
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:36,679
 of more complicated more hardcore model

3544
01:38:35,169 --> 01:38:36,679
 

3545
01:38:35,179 --> 01:38:38,840
 but actually do do well for certain

3546
01:38:36,669 --> 01:38:38,840
 

3547
01:38:36,679 --> 01:38:41,030
 tasks but if considerable fact would be

3548
01:38:38,830 --> 01:38:41,030
 

3549
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:42,770
 a model that is so huge it's important

3550
01:38:41,020 --> 01:38:42,770
 

3551
01:38:41,030 --> 01:38:44,900
 also to kind of think about the

3552
01:38:42,760 --> 01:38:44,900
 

3553
01:38:42,770 --> 01:38:47,179
 practical aspect and we are we're being

3554
01:38:44,890 --> 01:38:47,179
 

3555
01:38:44,900 --> 01:38:50,150
 that I mean if you see this as machine

3556
01:38:47,169 --> 01:38:50,150
 

3557
01:38:47,179 --> 01:38:52,130
 translation you like if you extrapolate

3558
01:38:50,140 --> 01:38:52,130
 

3559
01:38:50,150 --> 01:38:53,659
 a machine translation model and applied

3560
01:38:52,120 --> 01:38:53,659
 

3561
01:38:52,130 --> 01:38:55,219
 to dialogue here we think that kind of

3562
01:38:53,649 --> 01:38:55,219
 

3563
01:38:53,659 --> 01:38:59,050
 different so machine translation you

3564
01:38:55,209 --> 01:38:59,050
 

3565
01:38:55,219 --> 01:38:59,050
 have let's say a French input and

3566
01:38:59,080 --> 01:38:59,080
 

3567
01:38:59,090 --> 01:39:03,889
 French sentence as input and the English

3568
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:03,889
 

3569
01:39:01,730 --> 01:39:05,480
 sentence as output dialog is not like

3570
01:39:03,879 --> 01:39:05,480
 

3571
01:39:03,889 --> 01:39:09,619
 this like you have a sequence of turns

3572
01:39:05,470 --> 01:39:09,619
 

3573
01:39:05,480 --> 01:39:12,139
 so the way you can do this well I mean

3574
01:39:09,609 --> 01:39:12,139
 

3575
01:39:09,619 --> 01:39:14,590
 what one way to that handle race is like

3576
01:39:12,129 --> 01:39:14,590
 

3577
01:39:12,139 --> 01:39:17,389
 well I'm going to model typically like

3578
01:39:14,580 --> 01:39:17,389
 

3579
01:39:14,590 --> 01:39:19,580
 the output being a given response and

3580
01:39:17,379 --> 01:39:19,580
 

3581
01:39:17,389 --> 01:39:21,860
 the input being anything but comes

3582
01:39:19,570 --> 01:39:21,860
 

3583
01:39:19,580 --> 01:39:23,270
 before but that's kind of I mean you can

3584
01:39:21,850 --> 01:39:23,270
 

3585
01:39:21,860 --> 01:39:25,400
 see it doesn't really scale because if

3586
01:39:23,260 --> 01:39:25,400
 

3587
01:39:23,270 --> 01:39:27,380
 you have very long conversation you have

3588
01:39:25,390 --> 01:39:27,380
 

3589
01:39:25,400 --> 01:39:29,179
 to deal with it just multiplies your

3590
01:39:27,370 --> 01:39:29,179
 

3591
01:39:27,380 --> 01:39:30,110
 amount of data so you have to think

3592
01:39:29,169 --> 01:39:30,110
 

3593
01:39:29,179 --> 01:39:32,570
 there are different ways you can

3594
01:39:30,100 --> 01:39:32,570
 

3595
01:39:30,110 --> 01:39:34,849
 actually deal with that where maybe you

3596
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:34,849
 

3597
01:39:32,570 --> 01:39:36,290
 kind of go over conversation or maybe

3598
01:39:34,839 --> 01:39:36,290
 

3599
01:39:34,849 --> 01:39:40,250
 you propagate the hidden set from left

3600
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:40,250
 

3601
01:39:36,290 --> 01:39:41,929
 to right and do optimal like propagate

3602
01:39:40,240 --> 01:39:41,929
 

3603
01:39:40,250 --> 01:39:43,580
 the gradient backward and the so on

3604
01:39:41,919 --> 01:39:43,580
 

3605
01:39:41,929 --> 01:39:47,290
 there's certain tricks around this space

3606
01:39:43,570 --> 01:39:47,290
 

3607
01:39:43,580 --> 01:39:52,310
 but it's fairly kind of tricky issue so

3608
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:52,310
 

3609
01:39:47,290 --> 01:39:54,020
 now before I get also to a more specific

3610
01:39:52,300 --> 01:39:54,020
 

3611
01:39:52,310 --> 01:39:56,510
 issue to dialogue I'm gonna give you a

3612
01:39:54,010 --> 01:39:56,510
 

3613
01:39:54,020 --> 01:39:58,340
 sense like what how it works in practice

3614
01:39:56,500 --> 01:39:58,340
 

3615
01:39:56,510 --> 01:40:01,010
 so let's say you I mean one of the

3616
01:39:58,330 --> 01:40:01,010
 

3617
01:39:58,340 --> 01:40:03,830
 models we've been building is a fairly

3618
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,830
 

3619
01:40:01,010 --> 01:40:06,560
 big model with like dozens of million

3620
01:40:03,820 --> 01:40:06,560
 

3621
01:40:03,830 --> 01:40:07,940
 conversations but our train on Twitter

3622
01:40:06,550 --> 01:40:07,940
 

3623
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:09,650
 and but gives you a sample of

3624
01:40:07,930 --> 01:40:09,650
 

3625
01:40:07,940 --> 01:40:11,330
 conversation you can get so what you can

3626
01:40:09,640 --> 01:40:11,330
 

3627
01:40:09,650 --> 01:40:13,699
 see here is that because the data is

3628
01:40:11,320 --> 01:40:13,699
 

3629
01:40:11,330 --> 01:40:17,210
 fairly kind of shoddy in nature it the

3630
01:40:13,689 --> 01:40:17,210
 

3631
01:40:13,699 --> 01:40:21,760
 model can do fairly well on chatting

3632
01:40:17,200 --> 01:40:21,760
 

3633
01:40:17,210 --> 01:40:26,060
 like conversation so here so H stand for

3634
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:26,060
 

3635
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:27,800
 human and M is our one of our neural

3636
01:40:26,050 --> 01:40:27,800
 

3637
01:40:26,060 --> 01:40:29,389
 system and you can see like it's a how

3638
01:40:27,790 --> 01:40:29,389
 

3639
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:31,489
 are you not bad what's wrong nothing

3640
01:40:29,379 --> 01:40:31,489
 

3641
01:40:29,389 --> 01:40:33,920
 really and but if you go down the

3642
01:40:31,479 --> 01:40:33,920
 

3643
01:40:31,489 --> 01:40:35,980
 conversation you can see that it's

3644
01:40:33,910 --> 01:40:35,980
 

3645
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:40,580
 really being reactive okay

3646
01:40:35,970 --> 01:40:40,580
 

3647
01:40:35,980 --> 01:40:43,610
 it can also work in St really well but

3648
01:40:40,570 --> 01:40:43,610
 

3649
01:40:40,580 --> 01:40:45,260
 Mayor perhaps not law so when you switch

3650
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:45,260
 

3651
01:40:43,610 --> 01:40:48,349
 to a more kind of Cole oriented scenario

3652
01:40:45,250 --> 01:40:48,349
 

3653
01:40:45,260 --> 01:40:48,949
 so you ask about would first day

3654
01:40:48,339 --> 01:40:48,949
 

3655
01:40:48,349 --> 01:40:51,860
 afternoon

3656
01:40:48,939 --> 01:40:51,860
 

3657
01:40:48,949 --> 01:40:54,469
 work sometime yeah sure let me know when

3658
01:40:51,850 --> 01:40:54,469
 

3659
01:40:51,860 --> 01:40:57,320
 you're free and so on so and at some

3660
01:40:54,459 --> 01:40:57,320
 

3661
01:40:54,469 --> 01:41:01,219
 point the user says who to p.m. work for

3662
01:40:57,310 --> 01:41:01,219
 

3663
01:40:57,320 --> 01:41:03,020
 you machine works for me and let's say

3664
01:41:01,209 --> 01:41:03,020
 

3665
01:41:01,219 --> 01:41:04,730
 2:00 p.m. then receive you various

3666
01:41:03,010 --> 01:41:04,730
 

3667
01:41:03,020 --> 01:41:06,800
 sounds good so you can see that it has

3668
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:06,800
 

3669
01:41:04,730 --> 01:41:09,230
 this kind of chatty kind of maybe a bit

3670
01:41:06,790 --> 01:41:09,230
 

3671
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:10,760
 deflected behavior but it's it's also a

3672
01:41:09,220 --> 01:41:10,760
 

3673
01:41:09,230 --> 01:41:11,810
 bit kind of misleading because it says

3674
01:41:10,750 --> 01:41:11,810
 

3675
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:14,360
 well yes I'm going to do

3676
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:14,360
 

3677
01:41:11,810 --> 01:41:16,310
 something like I'm gonna agree what 2

3678
01:41:14,350 --> 01:41:16,310
 

3679
01:41:14,360 --> 01:41:18,320
 p.m. works but actually it's kind of

3680
01:41:16,300 --> 01:41:18,320
 

3681
01:41:16,310 --> 01:41:21,980
 completely vacuous because it's again a

3682
01:41:18,310 --> 01:41:21,980
 

3683
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:24,020
 system but has no grounding so ok but

3684
01:41:21,970 --> 01:41:24,020
 

3685
01:41:21,980 --> 01:41:27,200
 kind of set the background for more

3686
01:41:24,010 --> 01:41:27,200
 

3687
01:41:24,020 --> 01:41:31,520
 bigger challenges for applying end to

3688
01:41:27,190 --> 01:41:31,520
 

3689
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:33,230
 end dialogue I mean this model to end to

3690
01:41:31,510 --> 01:41:33,230
 

3691
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:35,120
 end dialogue so so one of the main

3692
01:41:33,220 --> 01:41:35,120
 

3693
01:41:33,230 --> 01:41:37,220
 challenges you might experience so if

3694
01:41:35,110 --> 01:41:37,220
 

3695
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:38,630
 you take like a vanilla let's say lsdm

3696
01:41:37,210 --> 01:41:38,630
 

3697
01:41:37,220 --> 01:41:41,030
 and applying to some dialogue data I

3698
01:41:38,620 --> 01:41:41,030
 

3699
01:41:38,630 --> 01:41:44,540
 will see immediately is that it's

3700
01:41:41,020 --> 01:41:44,540
 

3701
01:41:41,030 --> 01:41:46,190
 actually very bland so I mean again but

3702
01:41:44,530 --> 01:41:46,190
 

3703
01:41:44,540 --> 01:41:47,960
 that's something like how was your

3704
01:41:46,180 --> 01:41:47,960
 

3705
01:41:46,190 --> 01:41:49,090
 weekend I don't know what did you do I

3706
01:41:47,950 --> 01:41:49,090
 

3707
01:41:47,960 --> 01:41:51,200
 don't don't answer we talking about

3708
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:51,200
 

3709
01:41:49,090 --> 01:41:54,860
 visit getting boring yeah it's what I'm

3710
01:41:51,190 --> 01:41:54,860
 

3711
01:41:51,200 --> 01:41:56,870
 saying so that's just the raw output

3712
01:41:54,850 --> 01:41:56,870
 

3713
01:41:54,860 --> 01:41:58,670
 from very kind of vanilla sequence

3714
01:41:56,860 --> 01:41:58,670
 

3715
01:41:56,870 --> 01:42:02,540
 statistical model so you can see it's

3716
01:41:58,660 --> 01:42:02,540
 

3717
01:41:58,670 --> 01:42:04,100
 kind of obviously frustrating but we've

3718
01:42:02,530 --> 01:42:04,100
 

3719
01:42:02,540 --> 01:42:07,250
 been trying to see it to get to the

3720
01:42:04,090 --> 01:42:07,250
 

3721
01:42:04,100 --> 01:42:09,680
 bottom of it to try to see why this kind

3722
01:42:07,240 --> 01:42:09,680
 

3723
01:42:07,250 --> 01:42:13,010
 of problem is happening and but one of

3724
01:42:09,670 --> 01:42:13,010
 

3725
01:42:09,680 --> 01:42:14,900
 the core problem here is but I mean what

3726
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,900
 

3727
01:42:13,010 --> 01:42:18,310
 most of these models I mean we supervise

3728
01:42:14,890 --> 01:42:18,310
 

3729
01:42:14,900 --> 01:42:20,300
 one are optimized for our I mean

3730
01:42:18,300 --> 01:42:20,300
 

3731
01:42:18,310 --> 01:42:23,870
 likelihood objective so basically you

3732
01:42:20,290 --> 01:42:23,870
 

3733
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:25,490
 typically optimize visa with a croissant

3734
01:42:23,860 --> 01:42:25,490
 

3735
01:42:23,870 --> 01:42:27,680
 repiy or maybe someone really didn't

3736
01:42:25,480 --> 01:42:27,680
 

3737
01:42:25,490 --> 01:42:28,970
 measure but the IDS be you modeling the

3738
01:42:27,670 --> 01:42:28,970
 

3739
01:42:27,680 --> 01:42:32,120
 probability of a target getting to the

3740
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:32,120
 

3741
01:42:28,970 --> 01:42:36,460
 source and you can see here like one

3742
01:42:32,110 --> 01:42:36,460
 

3743
01:42:32,120 --> 01:42:38,810
 nature of the data is that a lot of to

3744
01:42:36,450 --> 01:42:38,810
 

3745
01:42:36,460 --> 01:42:41,090
 response is very deflected response like

3746
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:41,090
 

3747
01:42:38,810 --> 01:42:42,290
 I don't know are good actually good

3748
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:42,290
 

3749
01:42:41,090 --> 01:42:44,630
 response I mean at least plausible

3750
01:42:42,280 --> 01:42:44,630
 

3751
01:42:42,290 --> 01:42:45,980
 responses to a lot of queries so I mean

3752
01:42:44,620 --> 01:42:45,980
 

3753
01:42:44,630 --> 01:42:47,630
 the response I don't know it's actually

3754
01:42:45,970 --> 01:42:47,630
 

3755
01:42:45,980 --> 01:42:50,210
 technically a good response for any

3756
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:50,210
 

3757
01:42:47,630 --> 01:42:53,390
 question so the model effectively learns

3758
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:53,390
 

3759
01:42:50,210 --> 01:42:54,830
 but well actually if I respond I don't

3760
01:42:53,380 --> 01:42:54,830
 

3761
01:42:53,390 --> 01:42:57,050
 know all the time actually I get away

3762
01:42:54,820 --> 01:42:57,050
 

3763
01:42:54,830 --> 01:42:59,570
 getting perhaps fairly decent likelihood

3764
01:42:57,040 --> 01:42:59,570
 

3765
01:42:57,050 --> 01:43:01,160
 according to the model so that's why you

3766
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:01,160
 

3767
01:42:59,570 --> 01:43:03,020
 get so firms hubbub a model because it's

3768
01:43:01,150 --> 01:43:03,020
 

3769
01:43:01,160 --> 01:43:05,930
 just gonna say well most of these

3770
01:43:03,010 --> 01:43:05,930
 

3771
01:43:03,020 --> 01:43:07,550
 electrons are pretty good but instead of

3772
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:07,550
 

3773
01:43:05,930 --> 01:43:11,360
 it may be what we aren't what we want to

3774
01:43:07,540 --> 01:43:11,360
 

3775
01:43:07,550 --> 01:43:15,080
 use a more kind of symmetrical objective

3776
01:43:11,350 --> 01:43:15,080
 

3777
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:17,120
 where maybe well if a model is it likes

3778
01:43:15,070 --> 01:43:17,120
 

3779
01:43:15,080 --> 01:43:20,200
 very suppose I don't know according to P

3780
01:43:17,110 --> 01:43:20,200
 

3781
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:23,960
 of target given source model maybe well

3782
01:43:20,190 --> 01:43:23,960
 

3783
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:29,330
 I mean the idea is that

3784
01:43:23,950 --> 01:43:29,330
 

3785
01:43:23,960 --> 01:43:31,699
 if the response I don't know maybe you

3786
01:43:29,320 --> 01:43:31,699
 

3787
01:43:29,330 --> 01:43:34,040
 would not know what is the query but

3788
01:43:31,689 --> 01:43:34,040
 

3789
01:43:31,699 --> 01:43:35,630
 elicited very response so if you model

3790
01:43:34,030 --> 01:43:35,630
 

3791
01:43:34,040 --> 01:43:38,449
 the reverse direction let PF source

3792
01:43:35,620 --> 01:43:38,449
 

3793
01:43:35,630 --> 01:43:40,040
 given target then if I don't know it's

3794
01:43:38,439 --> 01:43:40,040
 

3795
01:43:38,449 --> 01:43:41,560
 actually not a good response because

3796
01:43:40,030 --> 01:43:41,560
 

3797
01:43:40,040 --> 01:43:44,360
 from that you cannot infer what the

3798
01:43:41,550 --> 01:43:44,360
 

3799
01:43:41,560 --> 01:43:46,130
 question might have been so that kind of

3800
01:43:44,350 --> 01:43:46,130
 

3801
01:43:44,360 --> 01:43:47,540
 motivation to move away from this kind

3802
01:43:46,120 --> 01:43:47,540
 

3803
01:43:46,130 --> 01:43:49,429
 of likelihood objective and use

3804
01:43:47,530 --> 01:43:49,429
 

3805
01:43:47,540 --> 01:43:52,190
 something that is more like again as I

3806
01:43:49,419 --> 01:43:52,190
 

3807
01:43:49,429 --> 01:43:54,230
 said symmetrical such as a material

3808
01:43:52,180 --> 01:43:54,230
 

3809
01:43:52,190 --> 01:43:56,560
 information objective so I mean ideally

3810
01:43:54,220 --> 01:43:56,560
 

3811
01:43:54,230 --> 01:43:58,940
 we want to take standard objective and

3812
01:43:56,550 --> 01:43:58,940
 

3813
01:43:56,560 --> 01:44:01,400
 optimize this according to what

3814
01:43:58,930 --> 01:44:01,400
 

3815
01:43:58,940 --> 01:44:03,620
 objective but it turns out like from a

3816
01:44:01,390 --> 01:44:03,620
 

3817
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:06,350
 training standpoint it's really tricky

3818
01:44:03,610 --> 01:44:06,350
 

3819
01:44:03,620 --> 01:44:08,570
 so what have done initially is to think

3820
01:44:06,340 --> 01:44:08,570
 

3821
01:44:06,350 --> 01:44:10,190
 of this well maybe you can use this as

3822
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:10,190
 

3823
01:44:08,570 --> 01:44:13,429
 an objective at least during inference

3824
01:44:10,180 --> 01:44:13,429
 

3825
01:44:10,190 --> 01:44:16,130
 so let's say okay you have a given s a

3826
01:44:13,419 --> 01:44:16,130
 

3827
01:44:13,429 --> 01:44:19,489
 source and you want to find the target T

3828
01:44:16,120 --> 01:44:19,489
 

3829
01:44:16,130 --> 01:44:21,620
 but maximizes use objective and so you

3830
01:44:19,479 --> 01:44:21,620
 

3831
01:44:19,489 --> 01:44:24,679
 can actually write with this way of

3832
01:44:21,610 --> 01:44:24,679
 

3833
01:44:21,620 --> 01:44:27,140
 Bayes rule and but if you read this

3834
01:44:24,669 --> 01:44:27,140
 

3835
01:44:24,679 --> 01:44:29,780
 objective this way you might see that

3836
01:44:27,130 --> 01:44:29,780
 

3837
01:44:27,140 --> 01:44:30,850
 well okay so refers to have a first one

3838
01:44:29,770 --> 01:44:30,850
 

3839
01:44:29,780 --> 01:44:33,290
 which is actually based on likelihood

3840
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:33,290
 

3841
01:44:30,850 --> 01:44:37,550
 component the second term log of peak

3842
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:37,550
 

3843
01:44:33,290 --> 01:44:39,830
 even of log P of T is more a key until

3844
01:44:37,540 --> 01:44:39,830
 

3845
01:44:37,550 --> 01:44:41,570
 it's a bit suspicious looking because

3846
01:44:39,820 --> 01:44:41,570
 

3847
01:44:39,830 --> 01:44:44,449
 it's more like an anti language model

3848
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:44,449
 

3849
01:44:41,570 --> 01:44:46,730
 it's not a language model because when

3850
01:44:44,439 --> 01:44:46,730
 

3851
01:44:44,449 --> 01:44:48,650
 those models produce good strength T is

3852
01:44:46,720 --> 01:44:48,650
 

3853
01:44:46,730 --> 01:44:50,540
 actually you get penalized for that

3854
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:50,540
 

3855
01:44:48,650 --> 01:44:55,670
 which kind of a bit counterintuitive so

3856
01:44:50,530 --> 01:44:55,670
 

3857
01:44:50,540 --> 01:44:58,280
 a different way to write with well

3858
01:44:55,660 --> 01:44:58,280
 

3859
01:44:55,670 --> 01:45:00,949
 actually let me just mention behave is

3860
01:44:58,270 --> 01:45:00,949
 

3861
01:44:58,280 --> 01:45:02,719
 you can maybe mitigate this a little bit

3862
01:45:00,939 --> 01:45:02,719
 

3863
01:45:00,949 --> 01:45:04,580
 with adding a lambda where you say well

3864
01:45:02,709 --> 01:45:04,580
 

3865
01:45:02,719 --> 01:45:07,219
 okay maybe I'm going to have a different

3866
01:45:04,570 --> 01:45:07,219
 

3867
01:45:04,580 --> 01:45:09,320
 this anti log machine language model

3868
01:45:07,209 --> 01:45:09,320
 

3869
01:45:07,219 --> 01:45:11,390
 component but maybe I can reduce it a

3870
01:45:09,310 --> 01:45:11,390
 

3871
01:45:09,320 --> 01:45:14,090
 little bit with perhaps a bit hockey a

3872
01:45:11,380 --> 01:45:14,090
 

3873
01:45:11,390 --> 01:45:15,890
 different way is to say well maybe you

3874
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:15,890
 

3875
01:45:14,090 --> 01:45:17,600
 want to combine both directions which is

3876
01:45:15,880 --> 01:45:17,600
 

3877
01:45:15,890 --> 01:45:19,010
 actually equivalent to the other like if

3878
01:45:17,590 --> 01:45:19,010
 

3879
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:21,260
 you can rewrite this as don't know where

3880
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,260
 

3881
01:45:19,010 --> 01:45:22,670
 you do some math here with Bayes theorem

3882
01:45:21,250 --> 01:45:22,670
 

3883
01:45:21,260 --> 01:45:25,790
 and actually you can rewrite this this

3884
01:45:22,660 --> 01:45:25,790
 

3885
01:45:22,670 --> 01:45:26,719
 way and but actually you get rid of this

3886
01:45:25,780 --> 01:45:26,719
 

3887
01:45:25,790 --> 01:45:28,730
 entire core

3888
01:45:26,709 --> 01:45:28,730
 

3889
01:45:26,719 --> 01:45:30,530
 language model component and actually

3890
01:45:28,720 --> 01:45:30,530
 

3891
01:45:28,730 --> 01:45:32,810
 this is quite what people have found

3892
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:32,810
 

3893
01:45:30,530 --> 01:45:33,920
 work a bit relatively well if you use

3894
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:33,920
 

3895
01:45:32,810 --> 01:45:35,820
 about during France it's actually

3896
01:45:33,910 --> 01:45:35,820
 

3897
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:38,550
 definitely reduced the amount of plan

3898
01:45:35,810 --> 01:45:38,550
 

3899
01:45:35,820 --> 01:45:39,810
 in your system even though ideally we

3900
01:45:38,540 --> 01:45:39,810
 

3901
01:45:38,550 --> 01:45:41,370
 would want to use this during training

3902
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:41,370
 

3903
01:45:39,810 --> 01:45:43,410
 but actually just doing this during

3904
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:43,410
 

3905
01:45:41,370 --> 01:45:46,050
 inference actually helps quite a bit so

3906
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:46,050
 

3907
01:45:43,410 --> 01:45:47,850
 now I mean remember you had this sample

3908
01:45:46,040 --> 01:45:47,850
 

3909
01:45:46,050 --> 01:45:50,670
 outputs before that were very bland and

3910
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:50,670
 

3911
01:45:47,850 --> 01:45:53,820
 deflective and if you use a if you use

3912
01:45:50,660 --> 01:45:53,820
 

3913
01:45:50,670 --> 01:45:55,920
 an MMI which stands for maximal

3914
01:45:53,810 --> 01:45:55,920
 

3915
01:45:53,820 --> 01:45:58,080
 information which is an object you can

3916
01:45:55,910 --> 01:45:58,080
 

3917
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:59,670
 use inference time then you can see the

3918
01:45:58,070 --> 01:45:59,670
 

3919
01:45:58,080 --> 01:46:02,670
 correspondence here but it learns our

3920
01:45:59,660 --> 01:46:02,670
 

3921
01:45:59,670 --> 01:46:05,040
 our let's deflective in the sense but

3922
01:46:02,660 --> 01:46:05,040
 

3923
01:46:02,670 --> 01:46:06,660
 you can kind of more get a sense of

3924
01:46:05,030 --> 01:46:06,660
 

3925
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:08,970
 one-to-one mapping between the source

3926
01:46:06,650 --> 01:46:08,970
 

3927
01:46:06,660 --> 01:46:11,430
 and the target so can I have one of

3928
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:11,430
 

3929
01:46:08,970 --> 01:46:14,190
 course you can and so on so it's much

3930
01:46:11,420 --> 01:46:14,190
 

3931
01:46:11,430 --> 01:46:16,230
 more kind of it gets rid of a lot of

3932
01:46:14,180 --> 01:46:16,230
 

3933
01:46:14,190 --> 01:46:17,970
 kind of planishing issue and from

3934
01:46:16,220 --> 01:46:17,970
 

3935
01:46:16,230 --> 01:46:19,710
 empirical standpoint you can also see

3936
01:46:17,960 --> 01:46:19,710
 

3937
01:46:17,970 --> 01:46:23,400
 that I mean if I have been some

3938
01:46:19,700 --> 01:46:23,400
 

3939
01:46:19,710 --> 01:46:25,860
 experiment showing but well Emily just

3940
01:46:23,390 --> 01:46:25,860
 

3941
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:28,680
 the standard vanilla lsdm you get like a

3942
01:46:25,850 --> 01:46:28,680
 

3943
01:46:25,860 --> 01:46:31,440
 very I mean visit lexical diversity here

3944
01:46:28,670 --> 01:46:31,440
 

3945
01:46:28,680 --> 01:46:32,880
 measured by a number of tokens divided

3946
01:46:31,430 --> 01:46:32,880
 

3947
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:34,560
 by the number of words a district number

3948
01:46:32,870 --> 01:46:34,560
 

3949
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:37,710
 of tokens develop a number of words and

3950
01:46:34,550 --> 01:46:37,710
 

3951
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:39,660
 if you compare this to human I mean this

3952
01:46:37,700 --> 01:46:39,660
 

3953
01:46:37,710 --> 01:46:42,120
 bland system are very actually extremely

3954
01:46:39,650 --> 01:46:42,120
 

3955
01:46:39,660 --> 01:46:44,010
 bland but if use a mental information

3956
01:46:42,110 --> 01:46:44,010
 

3957
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:46,110
 objective that actually rises the amount

3958
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,110
 

3959
01:46:44,010 --> 01:46:49,220
 of lexical diversity so it kind of helps

3960
01:46:46,100 --> 01:46:49,220
 

3961
01:46:46,110 --> 01:46:52,590
 and also it helps in terms of here you

3962
01:46:49,210 --> 01:46:52,590
 

3963
01:46:49,220 --> 01:46:54,210
 its values of blue which is a metric I'm

3964
01:46:52,580 --> 01:46:54,210
 

3965
01:46:52,590 --> 01:46:56,940
 going to talk about a bit later but it's

3966
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:56,940
 

3967
01:46:54,210 --> 01:46:59,670
 a fairly kind of noisy surrogate of

3968
01:46:56,930 --> 01:46:59,670
 

3969
01:46:56,940 --> 01:47:02,220
 quality and it also helps in typically

3970
01:46:59,660 --> 01:47:02,220
 

3971
01:46:59,670 --> 01:47:03,720
 in terms of quality and so I said have

3972
01:47:02,210 --> 01:47:03,720
 

3973
01:47:02,220 --> 01:47:05,160
 multiple challenges and perhaps the

3974
01:47:03,710 --> 01:47:05,160
 

3975
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:07,770
 second most important one is the

3976
01:47:05,150 --> 01:47:07,770
 

3977
01:47:05,160 --> 01:47:10,590
 consistency problem so you had this idea

3978
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:10,590
 

3979
01:47:07,770 --> 01:47:12,780
 that well we're not gonna just wrote

3980
01:47:10,580 --> 01:47:12,780
 

3981
01:47:10,590 --> 01:47:14,580
 it's a rolling conversation so we at

3982
01:47:12,770 --> 01:47:14,580
 

3983
01:47:12,780 --> 01:47:16,590
 each turn the system is gonna generate a

3984
01:47:14,570 --> 01:47:16,590
 

3985
01:47:14,580 --> 01:47:18,870
 response based on whatever was said

3986
01:47:16,580 --> 01:47:18,870
 

3987
01:47:16,590 --> 01:47:20,910
 previously but typically a dialogue

3988
01:47:18,860 --> 01:47:20,910
 

3989
01:47:18,870 --> 01:47:22,740
 system is just not one turn so you want

3990
01:47:20,900 --> 01:47:22,740
 

3991
01:47:20,910 --> 01:47:23,970
 the system to generate multiple turns so

3992
01:47:22,730 --> 01:47:23,970
 

3993
01:47:22,740 --> 01:47:26,550
 let's say you have conversation like

3994
01:47:23,960 --> 01:47:26,550
 

3995
01:47:23,970 --> 01:47:29,070
 this where again that's the message and

3996
01:47:26,540 --> 01:47:29,070
 

3997
01:47:26,550 --> 01:47:30,900
 response from the bot so where is your

3998
01:47:29,060 --> 01:47:30,900
 

3999
01:47:29,070 --> 01:47:33,030
 hometown the system responds I live in

4000
01:47:30,890 --> 01:47:33,030
 

4001
01:47:30,900 --> 01:47:37,610
 Indonesia where you from England are you

4002
01:47:33,020 --> 01:47:37,610
 

4003
01:47:33,030 --> 01:47:40,830
 so so that's another problem where you

4004
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:40,830
 

4005
01:47:37,610 --> 01:47:42,480
 the system is often not very consistent

4006
01:47:40,820 --> 01:47:42,480
 

4007
01:47:40,830 --> 01:47:44,670
 but you might say at some point is from

4008
01:47:42,470 --> 01:47:44,670
 

4009
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:46,030
 in Indonesia Ben England and so on so

4010
01:47:44,660 --> 01:47:46,030
 

4011
01:47:44,670 --> 01:47:47,770
 it's

4012
01:47:46,020 --> 01:47:47,770
 

4013
01:47:46,030 --> 01:47:51,250
 also fairly frustrating and it's just

4014
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:51,250
 

4015
01:47:47,770 --> 01:47:54,130
 degra gates for the user experience so

4016
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:54,130
 

4017
01:47:51,250 --> 01:47:55,810
 and so you might wonder wife is actually

4018
01:47:54,120 --> 01:47:55,810
 

4019
01:47:54,130 --> 01:47:57,850
 happening and that's I think that's

4020
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:57,850
 

4021
01:47:55,810 --> 01:47:59,950
 something interesting comparing like

4022
01:47:57,840 --> 01:47:59,950
 

4023
01:47:57,850 --> 01:48:02,860
 dialog data to over tasks so

4024
01:47:59,940 --> 01:48:02,860
 

4025
01:47:59,950 --> 01:48:06,070
 conversation data is coming from many

4026
01:48:02,850 --> 01:48:06,070
 

4027
01:48:02,860 --> 01:48:07,450
 very many different users where in the

4028
01:48:06,060 --> 01:48:07,450
 

4029
01:48:06,070 --> 01:48:10,660
 data you might have instances of a

4030
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:10,660
 

4031
01:48:07,450 --> 01:48:12,340
 question where were you born and because

4032
01:48:10,650 --> 01:48:12,340
 

4033
01:48:10,660 --> 01:48:14,710
 let's say it's the data comes from

4034
01:48:12,330 --> 01:48:14,710
 

4035
01:48:12,340 --> 01:48:16,500
 Twitter you have like hundreds or maybe

4036
01:48:14,700 --> 01:48:16,500
 

4037
01:48:14,710 --> 01:48:18,520
 thousands of different user but ever

4038
01:48:16,490 --> 01:48:18,520
 

4039
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:20,290
 responded to that question on Twitter

4040
01:48:18,510 --> 01:48:20,290
 

4041
01:48:18,520 --> 01:48:21,880
 some people might some people might have

4042
01:48:20,280 --> 01:48:21,880
 

4043
01:48:20,290 --> 01:48:25,930
 responded London on New York and Seattle

4044
01:48:21,870 --> 01:48:25,930
 

4045
01:48:21,880 --> 01:48:28,240
 and but it's a bit of a mixed structure

4046
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:28,240
 

4047
01:48:25,930 --> 01:48:30,490
 here where maybe the response of one

4048
01:48:28,230 --> 01:48:30,490
 

4049
01:48:28,240 --> 01:48:32,770
 being London is response to a question

4050
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:32,770
 

4051
01:48:30,490 --> 01:48:35,170
 where were born and for some other

4052
01:48:32,760 --> 01:48:35,170
 

4053
01:48:32,770 --> 01:48:37,330
 persons where do you live so the data

4054
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:37,330
 

4055
01:48:35,170 --> 01:48:38,350
 compared to say again I'm going to bring

4056
01:48:37,320 --> 01:48:38,350
 

4057
01:48:37,330 --> 01:48:40,680
 the example of machine translation

4058
01:48:38,340 --> 01:48:40,680
 

4059
01:48:38,350 --> 01:48:43,600
 machine translation somatically

4060
01:48:40,670 --> 01:48:43,600
 

4061
01:48:40,680 --> 01:48:46,960
 instances are very one-to-one one

4062
01:48:43,590 --> 01:48:46,960
 

4063
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:49,060
 sentence means the over sentence but

4064
01:48:46,950 --> 01:48:49,060
 

4065
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:51,490
 maybe phrase differently I mean it's

4066
01:48:49,050 --> 01:48:51,490
 

4067
01:48:49,060 --> 01:48:53,380
 well they are kind of different

4068
01:48:51,480 --> 01:48:53,380
 

4069
01:48:51,490 --> 01:48:57,430
 languages so is it going to be phrased

4070
01:48:53,370 --> 01:48:57,430
 

4071
01:48:53,380 --> 01:48:59,590
 differently but you you have with

4072
01:48:57,420 --> 01:48:59,590
 

4073
01:48:57,430 --> 01:49:01,240
 different responses the same input would

4074
01:48:59,580 --> 01:49:01,240
 

4075
01:48:59,590 --> 01:49:03,610
 be semantically equivalent but it's not

4076
01:49:01,230 --> 01:49:03,610
 

4077
01:49:01,240 --> 01:49:05,620
 the case here in dialogue because again

4078
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:05,620
 

4079
01:49:03,610 --> 01:49:08,080
 you have many different people so it's

4080
01:49:05,610 --> 01:49:08,080
 

4081
01:49:05,620 --> 01:49:10,210
 not one-to-one so one way to kind of

4082
01:49:08,070 --> 01:49:10,210
 

4083
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:11,920
 explain where these differences may be

4084
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:11,920
 

4085
01:49:10,210 --> 01:49:14,650
 to say well the input let's say it's not

4086
01:49:11,910 --> 01:49:14,650
 

4087
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:16,980
 only a query but maybe some information

4088
01:49:14,640 --> 01:49:16,980
 

4089
01:49:14,650 --> 01:49:19,300
 about the user let's say speaker idea so

4090
01:49:16,970 --> 01:49:19,300
 

4091
01:49:16,980 --> 01:49:21,940
 one of the models to actually deal with

4092
01:49:19,290 --> 01:49:21,940
 

4093
01:49:19,300 --> 01:49:25,750
 this issue was a personal response

4094
01:49:21,930 --> 01:49:25,750
 

4095
01:49:21,940 --> 01:49:27,790
 generation model that kind of like

4096
01:49:25,740 --> 01:49:27,790
 

4097
01:49:25,750 --> 01:49:29,770
 extend the idea for using word emitting

4098
01:49:27,780 --> 01:49:29,770
 

4099
01:49:27,790 --> 01:49:32,710
 so most of you are from new for whatever

4100
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:32,710
 

4101
01:49:29,770 --> 01:49:34,510
 meanings were maybe you know but it has

4102
01:49:32,700 --> 01:49:34,510
 

4103
01:49:32,710 --> 01:49:36,910
 it creates the semantics fairway cluster

4104
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:36,910
 

4105
01:49:34,510 --> 01:49:39,100
 words and put them close by if you have

4106
01:49:36,900 --> 01:49:39,100
 

4107
01:49:36,910 --> 01:49:43,690
 if you have the same meaning in a given

4108
01:49:39,090 --> 01:49:43,690
 

4109
01:49:39,100 --> 01:49:46,090
 context and but beyond weather medic in

4110
01:49:43,680 --> 01:49:46,090
 

4111
01:49:43,690 --> 01:49:48,610
 VAT model this personalized model with

4112
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:48,610
 

4113
01:49:46,090 --> 01:49:50,650
 the notion of speaker and bidding so it

4114
01:49:48,600 --> 01:49:50,650
 

4115
01:49:48,610 --> 01:49:53,230
 has basically tests associated for each

4116
01:49:50,640 --> 01:49:53,230
 

4117
01:49:50,650 --> 01:49:55,810
 speaker ID as so called speaker

4118
01:49:53,220 --> 01:49:55,810
 

4119
01:49:53,230 --> 01:49:57,820
 embedding that is also learn

4120
01:49:55,800 --> 01:49:57,820
 

4121
01:49:55,810 --> 01:49:59,429
 unsupervised lis like the same as word

4122
01:49:57,810 --> 01:49:59,429
 

4123
01:49:57,820 --> 01:50:03,730
 embedding but here

4124
01:49:59,419 --> 01:50:03,730
 

4125
01:49:59,429 --> 01:50:06,340
 clusters like speaker ideas about tend

4126
01:50:03,720 --> 01:50:06,340
 

4127
01:50:03,730 --> 01:50:08,949
 to respond the same way so so if let's

4128
01:50:06,330 --> 01:50:08,949
 

4129
01:50:06,340 --> 01:50:11,139
 say a given speaker has a tendency to

4130
01:50:08,939 --> 01:50:11,139
 

4131
01:50:08,949 --> 01:50:14,199
 say reward England more than on average

4132
01:50:11,129 --> 01:50:14,199
 

4133
01:50:11,139 --> 01:50:16,300
 it would be closer to over people would

4134
01:50:14,189 --> 01:50:16,300
 

4135
01:50:14,199 --> 01:50:18,760
 have the same tendency so effectively

4136
01:50:16,290 --> 01:50:18,760
 

4137
01:50:16,300 --> 01:50:20,770
 it's kind of building a representation

4138
01:50:18,750 --> 01:50:20,770
 

4139
01:50:18,760 --> 01:50:22,630
 of the different users and who actually

4140
01:50:20,760 --> 01:50:22,630
 

4141
01:50:20,770 --> 01:50:24,489
 did some analysis of this speaker remedy

4142
01:50:22,620 --> 01:50:24,489
 

4143
01:50:22,630 --> 01:50:26,860
 is kind of interesting because we'll we

4144
01:50:24,479 --> 01:50:26,860
 

4145
01:50:24,489 --> 01:50:28,780
 found clusters of British English and

4146
01:50:26,850 --> 01:50:28,780
 

4147
01:50:26,860 --> 01:50:30,940
 cluster for American English and so on

4148
01:50:28,770 --> 01:50:30,940
 

4149
01:50:28,780 --> 01:50:33,100
 but also it's it's kind of it's very

4150
01:50:30,930 --> 01:50:33,100
 

4151
01:50:30,940 --> 01:50:35,340
 multi-dimensional it's also has you

4152
01:50:33,090 --> 01:50:35,340
 

4153
01:50:33,100 --> 01:50:37,840
 aspect of well if model is so like

4154
01:50:35,330 --> 01:50:37,840
 

4155
01:50:35,340 --> 01:50:39,610
 preferences so for example some of you

4156
01:50:37,830 --> 01:50:39,610
 

4157
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:41,620
 users often talk about cooking some over

4158
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:41,620
 

4159
01:50:39,610 --> 01:50:42,880
 about baseball and it's also kind of

4160
01:50:41,610 --> 01:50:42,880
 

4161
01:50:41,620 --> 01:50:44,770
 interesting because if you look at the

4162
01:50:42,870 --> 01:50:44,770
 

4163
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:46,960
 clusters of baseball's those who spoke

4164
01:50:44,760 --> 01:50:46,960
 

4165
01:50:44,770 --> 01:50:51,159
 at speak out baseball we tend to be more

4166
01:50:46,950 --> 01:50:51,159
 

4167
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:55,150
 closer will be closer to us but our in

4168
01:50:51,149 --> 01:50:55,150
 

4169
01:50:51,159 --> 01:50:58,360
 the u.s. so it's kind of it's it's a way

4170
01:50:55,140 --> 01:50:58,360
 

4171
01:50:55,150 --> 01:51:01,480
 to kind of again disentangle this data

4172
01:50:58,350 --> 01:51:01,480
 

4173
01:50:58,360 --> 01:51:03,010
 but also in a way it enables the model

4174
01:51:01,470 --> 01:51:03,010
 

4175
01:51:01,480 --> 01:51:05,290
 to be somewhat more general because

4176
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,290
 

4177
01:51:03,010 --> 01:51:08,800
 let's say for even speaker I did my

4178
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:08,800
 

4179
01:51:05,290 --> 01:51:11,800
 never has responded to a question where

4180
01:51:08,790 --> 01:51:11,800
 

4181
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:12,969
 do we live but because let's say the

4182
01:51:11,790 --> 01:51:12,969
 

4183
01:51:11,800 --> 01:51:16,000
 speaker embeddings close to another

4184
01:51:12,959 --> 01:51:16,000
 

4185
01:51:12,969 --> 01:51:18,580
 speaker embedding of a user who

4186
01:51:15,990 --> 01:51:18,580
 

4187
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:21,340
 responded to a question late prior in

4188
01:51:18,570 --> 01:51:21,340
 

4189
01:51:18,580 --> 01:51:23,800
 the training data it's able the model is

4190
01:51:21,330 --> 01:51:23,800
 

4191
01:51:21,340 --> 01:51:26,050
 able to give a satisfactory answer to

4192
01:51:23,790 --> 01:51:26,050
 

4193
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:28,840
 that question so it's kind of a nice way

4194
01:51:26,040 --> 01:51:28,840
 

4195
01:51:26,050 --> 01:51:29,980
 of like with speaker embedding and

4196
01:51:28,830 --> 01:51:29,980
 

4197
01:51:28,840 --> 01:51:32,170
 building a single model to actually

4198
01:51:29,970 --> 01:51:32,170
 

4199
01:51:29,980 --> 01:51:35,679
 generalize in a way that wouldn't work

4200
01:51:32,160 --> 01:51:35,679
 

4201
01:51:32,170 --> 01:51:37,900
 if say you chop up the training data

4202
01:51:35,669 --> 01:51:37,900
 

4203
01:51:35,679 --> 01:51:41,080
 into one for each speaker and that would

4204
01:51:37,890 --> 01:51:41,080
 

4205
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:43,690
 not work at all so I mean this like the

4206
01:51:41,070 --> 01:51:43,690
 

4207
01:51:41,080 --> 01:51:45,730
 simple comparison to see we've without a

4208
01:51:43,680 --> 01:51:45,730
 

4209
01:51:43,690 --> 01:51:47,469
 speaker embedding and the big so on the

4210
01:51:45,720 --> 01:51:47,469
 

4211
01:51:45,730 --> 01:51:49,870
 left hand side it's what examples are

4212
01:51:47,459 --> 01:51:49,870
 

4213
01:51:47,469 --> 01:51:52,449
 shown before and the right hand side is

4214
01:51:49,860 --> 01:51:52,449
 

4215
01:51:49,870 --> 01:51:54,310
 where an example of when you use a

4216
01:51:52,439 --> 01:51:54,310
 

4217
01:51:52,449 --> 01:51:56,949
 speaker embedding representation and

4218
01:51:54,300 --> 01:51:56,949
 

4219
01:51:54,310 --> 01:51:59,620
 this with a personal model it has much

4220
01:51:56,939 --> 01:51:59,620
 

4221
01:51:56,949 --> 01:52:02,440
 more consistency so what is your major

4222
01:51:59,610 --> 01:52:02,440
 

4223
01:51:59,620 --> 01:52:04,690
 business you what did you study in

4224
01:52:02,430 --> 01:52:04,690
 

4225
01:52:02,440 --> 01:52:06,610
 college I did Business Studies so it's

4226
01:52:04,680 --> 01:52:06,610
 

4227
01:52:04,690 --> 01:52:08,409
 it's not perfect but it's it's

4228
01:52:06,600 --> 01:52:08,409
 

4229
01:52:06,610 --> 01:52:12,580
 definitely has much more consistency

4230
01:52:08,399 --> 01:52:12,580
 

4231
01:52:08,409 --> 01:52:16,020
 because we in the Langley in models that

4232
01:52:12,570 --> 01:52:16,020
 

4233
01:52:12,580 --> 01:52:19,000
 I never aspect another way to actually

4234
01:52:16,010 --> 01:52:19,000
 

4235
01:52:16,020 --> 01:52:21,100
 do personalization is so in the priests

4236
01:52:18,990 --> 01:52:21,100
 

4237
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:23,140
 example I was assuming that for each

4238
01:52:21,090 --> 01:52:23,140
 

4239
01:52:21,100 --> 01:52:24,480
 speaker you actually do have some

4240
01:52:23,130 --> 01:52:24,480
 

4241
01:52:23,140 --> 01:52:27,190
 research on data but wait a second

4242
01:52:24,470 --> 01:52:27,190
 

4243
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:29,530
 oftentimes it's a relatively unrealistic

4244
01:52:27,180 --> 01:52:29,530
 

4245
01:52:27,190 --> 01:52:31,150
 assumption because maybe you're dealing

4246
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:31,150
 

4247
01:52:29,530 --> 01:52:33,580
 with a new user or maybe you have only

4248
01:52:31,140 --> 01:52:33,580
 

4249
01:52:31,150 --> 01:52:36,640
 some text general text data given a user

4250
01:52:33,570 --> 01:52:36,640
 

4251
01:52:33,580 --> 01:52:37,300
 so let's say you have some data about a

4252
01:52:36,630 --> 01:52:37,300
 

4253
01:52:36,640 --> 01:52:39,400
 given user

4254
01:52:37,290 --> 01:52:39,400
 

4255
01:52:37,300 --> 01:52:41,620
 but maybe and for the sake of the

4256
01:52:39,390 --> 01:52:41,620
 

4257
01:52:39,400 --> 01:52:44,560
 example here let's say it's a developer

4258
01:52:41,610 --> 01:52:44,560
 

4259
01:52:41,620 --> 01:52:47,620
 who described herself or himself as a

4260
01:52:44,550 --> 01:52:47,620
 

4261
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:50,560
 code ninja okay and but then you have a

4262
01:52:47,610 --> 01:52:50,560
 

4263
01:52:47,620 --> 01:52:52,480
 background dialog data let's say it's

4264
01:52:50,550 --> 01:52:52,480
 

4265
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:54,790
 general it might again come from Twitter

4266
01:52:52,470 --> 01:52:54,790
 

4267
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:57,400
 and they might be questioned they're

4268
01:52:54,780 --> 01:52:57,400
 

4269
01:52:54,790 --> 01:52:59,170
 like what's your job and there might be

4270
01:52:57,390 --> 01:52:59,170
 

4271
01:52:57,400 --> 01:53:00,700
 a variety of different responses but

4272
01:52:59,160 --> 01:53:00,700
 

4273
01:52:59,170 --> 01:53:02,320
 let's say that developers where would

4274
01:53:00,690 --> 01:53:02,320
 

4275
01:53:00,700 --> 01:53:03,850
 respond something for this would be more

4276
01:53:02,310 --> 01:53:03,850
 

4277
01:53:02,320 --> 01:53:06,250
 typical of a software engineer was

4278
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:06,250
 

4279
01:53:03,850 --> 01:53:08,710
 responding to a question with the title

4280
01:53:06,240 --> 01:53:08,710
 

4281
01:53:06,250 --> 01:53:11,230
 software engineer we might say developer

4282
01:53:08,700 --> 01:53:11,230
 

4283
01:53:08,710 --> 01:53:13,000
 and so on but maybe very few of a mood

4284
01:53:11,220 --> 01:53:13,000
 

4285
01:53:11,230 --> 01:53:15,220
 response I'm a code ninja so how do you

4286
01:53:12,990 --> 01:53:15,220
 

4287
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:17,710
 train a model like this where you have a

4288
01:53:15,210 --> 01:53:17,710
 

4289
01:53:15,220 --> 01:53:20,350
 little bit of data but with its own

4290
01:53:17,700 --> 01:53:20,350
 

4291
01:53:17,710 --> 01:53:22,540
 these secrecy's but it doesn't map what

4292
01:53:20,340 --> 01:53:22,540
 

4293
01:53:20,350 --> 01:53:24,460
 is in the general training data so one

4294
01:53:22,530 --> 01:53:24,460
 

4295
01:53:22,540 --> 01:53:27,910
 idea is like to use multitask learning

4296
01:53:24,450 --> 01:53:27,910
 

4297
01:53:24,460 --> 01:53:29,800
 and the idea here is like maybe you have

4298
01:53:27,900 --> 01:53:29,800
 

4299
01:53:27,910 --> 01:53:31,930
 a sequence sequence model an autoencoder

4300
01:53:29,790 --> 01:53:31,930
 

4301
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:33,640
 model so the sequence two kids are at

4302
01:53:31,920 --> 01:53:33,640
 

4303
01:53:31,930 --> 01:53:35,710
 the top here what color are bottom and

4304
01:53:33,630 --> 01:53:35,710
 

4305
01:53:33,640 --> 01:53:39,010
 the idea here is with multitask learning

4306
01:53:35,700 --> 01:53:39,010
 

4307
01:53:35,710 --> 01:53:42,570
 you kind of have batches iver of a top

4308
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:42,570
 

4309
01:53:39,010 --> 01:53:45,640
 or bottom and you update the parameters

4310
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:45,640
 

4311
01:53:42,570 --> 01:53:47,710
 so bad in a way that actually ties the

4312
01:53:45,630 --> 01:53:47,710
 

4313
01:53:45,640 --> 01:53:51,750
 target lslam parameters so we

4314
01:53:47,700 --> 01:53:51,750
 

4315
01:53:47,710 --> 01:53:56,140
 effectively what it has become at is

4316
01:53:51,740 --> 01:53:56,140
 

4317
01:53:51,750 --> 01:53:58,570
 when it kind of infuses certain tendency

4318
01:53:56,130 --> 01:53:58,570
 

4319
01:53:56,140 --> 01:54:00,070
 to certain words so let's say because if

4320
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:00,070
 

4321
01:53:58,570 --> 01:54:03,010
 you see an autoencoder you to generate

4322
01:54:00,060 --> 01:54:03,010
 

4323
01:54:00,070 --> 01:54:04,780
 the string at I'm a code ninja and it

4324
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:04,780
 

4325
01:54:03,010 --> 01:54:06,910
 brings this tendency because the

4326
01:54:04,770 --> 01:54:06,910
 

4327
01:54:04,780 --> 01:54:08,920
 parameters are tied here into the target

4328
01:54:06,900 --> 01:54:08,920
 

4329
01:54:06,910 --> 01:54:11,200
 lsdm of a sequence to sequence model so

4330
01:54:08,910 --> 01:54:11,200
 

4331
01:54:08,920 --> 01:54:12,940
 effectively bottom model is just fair

4332
01:54:11,190 --> 01:54:12,940
 

4333
01:54:11,200 --> 01:54:15,190
 useful during training but then is

4334
01:54:12,930 --> 01:54:15,190
 

4335
01:54:12,940 --> 01:54:16,480
 thrown away and once you do visit

4336
01:54:15,180 --> 01:54:16,480
 

4337
01:54:15,190 --> 01:54:19,060
 multitask learning at the end of the day

4338
01:54:16,470 --> 01:54:19,060
 

4339
01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:21,070
 you just keep what's at the top here but

4340
01:54:19,050 --> 01:54:21,070
 

4341
01:54:19,060 --> 01:54:23,380
 when you have a model that when it's

4342
01:54:21,060 --> 01:54:23,380
 

4343
01:54:21,070 --> 01:54:25,240
 query do for write questions let's say

4344
01:54:23,370 --> 01:54:25,240
 

4345
01:54:23,380 --> 01:54:26,110
 what's your job rather than saying

4346
01:54:25,230 --> 01:54:26,110
 

4347
01:54:25,240 --> 01:54:28,210
 something buddies

4348
01:54:26,100 --> 01:54:28,210
 

4349
01:54:26,110 --> 01:54:30,330
 more vanilla like so transient would

4350
01:54:28,200 --> 01:54:30,330
 

4351
01:54:28,210 --> 01:54:32,409
 respond I'm a good ninja to kind of

4352
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:32,409
 

4353
01:54:30,330 --> 01:54:35,350
 model is the personalization but is

4354
01:54:32,399 --> 01:54:35,350
 

4355
01:54:32,409 --> 01:54:37,860
 specific to what data a bit data

4356
01:54:35,340 --> 01:54:37,860
 

4357
01:54:35,350 --> 01:54:40,179
 specific to the user

4358
01:54:37,850 --> 01:54:40,179
 

4359
01:54:37,860 --> 01:54:42,699
 well one of the challenges of multitask

4360
01:54:40,169 --> 01:54:42,699
 

4361
01:54:40,179 --> 01:54:45,250
 learning is that well if you have such a

4362
01:54:42,689 --> 01:54:45,250
 

4363
01:54:42,699 --> 01:54:48,340
 model is like you bringing together data

4364
01:54:45,240 --> 01:54:48,340
 

4365
01:54:45,250 --> 01:54:51,730
 like data set like maybe the convention

4366
01:54:48,330 --> 01:54:51,730
 

4367
01:54:48,340 --> 01:54:53,110
 example with more over general data said

4368
01:54:51,720 --> 01:54:53,110
 

4369
01:54:51,730 --> 01:54:55,719
 what kind of not really tied together

4370
01:54:53,100 --> 01:54:55,719
 

4371
01:54:53,110 --> 01:54:57,880
 very well so what happens in if you

4372
01:54:55,709 --> 01:54:57,880
 

4373
01:54:55,719 --> 01:55:01,300
 train a multitask learning model like

4374
01:54:57,870 --> 01:55:01,300
 

4375
01:54:57,880 --> 01:55:04,540
 that is the hidden state representation

4376
01:55:01,290 --> 01:55:04,540
 

4377
01:55:01,300 --> 01:55:07,389
 the busy but you have from in the middle

4378
01:55:04,530 --> 01:55:07,389
 

4379
01:55:04,540 --> 01:55:09,580
 between the encoder and decoder that we

4380
01:55:07,379 --> 01:55:09,580
 

4381
01:55:07,389 --> 01:55:11,530
 tend to be from different clusters so

4382
01:55:09,570 --> 01:55:11,530
 

4383
01:55:09,580 --> 01:55:13,000
 what you have been read here is

4384
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:13,000
 

4385
01:55:11,530 --> 01:55:15,369
 basically the channel data and what in

4386
01:55:12,990 --> 01:55:15,369
 

4387
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:17,619
 blue is vo 200 that there are again

4388
01:55:15,359 --> 01:55:17,619
 

4389
01:55:15,369 --> 01:55:19,869
 black for maybe cone into example but

4390
01:55:17,609 --> 01:55:19,869
 

4391
01:55:17,619 --> 01:55:24,219
 ideally what you want is something that

4392
01:55:19,859 --> 01:55:24,219
 

4393
01:55:19,869 --> 01:55:26,110
 is more fused because you want kind of a

4394
01:55:24,209 --> 01:55:26,110
 

4395
01:55:24,219 --> 01:55:28,780
 two dataset being aligned with each

4396
01:55:26,100 --> 01:55:28,780
 

4397
01:55:26,110 --> 01:55:31,000
 other but this is really not happening

4398
01:55:28,770 --> 01:55:31,000
 

4399
01:55:28,780 --> 01:55:34,119
 by default so one way to do this is it's

4400
01:55:30,990 --> 01:55:34,119
 

4401
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:36,670
 actually in a paper but is at ACL Vizier

4402
01:55:34,109 --> 01:55:36,670
 

4403
01:55:34,119 --> 01:55:38,920
 is like well if you haven't lost your

4404
01:55:36,660 --> 01:55:38,920
 

4405
01:55:36,670 --> 01:55:41,710
 objective here with optimizing in

4406
01:55:38,910 --> 01:55:41,710
 

4407
01:55:38,920 --> 01:55:45,550
 addition to this vanilla Alice to sick

4408
01:55:41,700 --> 01:55:45,550
 

4409
01:55:41,710 --> 01:55:47,320
 and multitask objective add what is

4410
01:55:45,540 --> 01:55:47,320
 

4411
01:55:45,550 --> 01:55:55,090
 called space-vision so it's a loss but

4412
01:55:47,310 --> 01:55:55,090
 

4413
01:55:47,320 --> 01:56:00,520
 basically encourages with ZZZ to be more

4414
01:55:55,080 --> 01:56:00,520
 

4415
01:55:55,090 --> 01:56:01,840
 together so it kind of it it it has an

4416
01:56:00,510 --> 01:56:01,840
 

4417
01:56:00,520 --> 01:56:04,090
 objective but you use the cross space

4418
01:56:01,830 --> 01:56:04,090
 

4419
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:08,710
 distance and same position so he is

4420
01:56:04,080 --> 01:56:08,710
 

4421
01:56:04,090 --> 01:56:12,489
 trying to bring together things for on

4422
01:56:08,700 --> 01:56:12,489
 

4423
01:56:08,710 --> 01:56:14,170
 from like I mean it's basically trying

4424
01:56:12,479 --> 01:56:14,170
 

4425
01:56:12,489 --> 01:56:20,199
 to bring the red dot closer to do that

4426
01:56:14,160 --> 01:56:20,199
 

4427
01:56:14,170 --> 01:56:22,810
 and I never think that is specific to

4428
01:56:20,189 --> 01:56:22,810
 

4429
01:56:20,199 --> 01:56:25,449
 personalization is so one problem we

4430
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:25,449
 

4431
01:56:22,810 --> 01:56:27,429
 have with personal model is that you

4432
01:56:25,439 --> 01:56:27,429
 

4433
01:56:25,449 --> 01:56:29,440
 model response given many different

4434
01:56:27,419 --> 01:56:29,440
 

4435
01:56:27,429 --> 01:56:31,449
 things you modeling response given a

4436
01:56:29,430 --> 01:56:31,449
 

4437
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:38,349
 context a query and persona but

4438
01:56:31,439 --> 01:56:38,349
 

4439
01:56:31,449 --> 01:56:39,430
 oftentimes like the context of

4440
01:56:38,339 --> 01:56:39,430
 

4441
01:56:38,349 --> 01:56:41,860
 conversation give it

4442
01:56:39,420 --> 01:56:41,860
 

4443
01:56:39,430 --> 01:56:44,200
 about what the person is like so for

4444
01:56:41,850 --> 01:56:44,200
 

4445
01:56:41,860 --> 01:56:47,890
 example if if you're trying to model or

4446
01:56:44,190 --> 01:56:47,890
 

4447
01:56:44,200 --> 01:56:49,540
 responsibilities but is informal the

4448
01:56:47,880 --> 01:56:49,540
 

4449
01:56:47,890 --> 01:56:51,460
 context would typically be very informal

4450
01:56:49,530 --> 01:56:51,460
 

4451
01:56:49,540 --> 01:56:52,960
 so it's not good way to explain a wave

4452
01:56:51,450 --> 01:56:52,960
 

4453
01:56:51,460 --> 01:56:55,540
 at response so one way to is to

4454
01:56:52,950 --> 01:56:55,540
 

4455
01:56:52,960 --> 01:56:58,720
 introduce multiple losses where you have

4456
01:56:55,530 --> 01:56:58,720
 

4457
01:56:55,540 --> 01:57:00,640
 you have not only the loss of peer

4458
01:56:58,710 --> 01:57:00,640
 

4459
01:56:58,720 --> 01:57:02,830
 response given context and query and

4460
01:57:00,630 --> 01:57:02,830
 

4461
01:57:00,640 --> 01:57:04,720
 persona but you say okay what about to

4462
01:57:02,820 --> 01:57:04,720
 

4463
01:57:02,830 --> 01:57:07,270
 have a distinct losses where a predict

4464
01:57:04,710 --> 01:57:07,270
 

4465
01:57:04,720 --> 01:57:08,860
 try to predict the response with any of

4466
01:57:07,260 --> 01:57:08,860
 

4467
01:57:07,270 --> 01:57:11,410
 these traits so for example I tried to

4468
01:57:08,850 --> 01:57:11,410
 

4469
01:57:08,860 --> 01:57:13,750
 predict response using but personally or

4470
01:57:11,400 --> 01:57:13,750
 

4471
01:57:11,410 --> 01:57:16,570
 maybe about the query using the query

4472
01:57:13,740 --> 01:57:16,570
 

4473
01:57:13,750 --> 01:57:19,080
 only so having this kind of multiple

4474
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:19,080
 

4475
01:57:16,570 --> 01:57:21,580
 loss this ad this ability to actually

4476
01:57:19,070 --> 01:57:21,580
 

4477
01:57:19,080 --> 01:57:24,100
 make it the distinction between user a

4478
01:57:21,570 --> 01:57:24,100
 

4479
01:57:21,580 --> 01:57:25,750
 bit sharper because we have is kind of

4480
01:57:24,090 --> 01:57:25,750
 

4481
01:57:24,100 --> 01:57:27,610
 teased apart and especially having the

4482
01:57:25,740 --> 01:57:27,610
 

4483
01:57:25,750 --> 01:57:29,650
 peer response given persona is important

4484
01:57:27,600 --> 01:57:29,650
 

4485
01:57:27,610 --> 01:57:32,410
 it's actually fairly a hard task predict

4486
01:57:29,640 --> 01:57:32,410
 

4487
01:57:29,650 --> 01:57:34,330
 the response given only knowing only the

4488
01:57:32,400 --> 01:57:34,330
 

4489
01:57:32,410 --> 01:57:36,580
 speaker ID and that actually shows what

4490
01:57:34,320 --> 01:57:36,580
 

4491
01:57:34,330 --> 01:57:41,230
 even though it doesn't is Li lets you

4492
01:57:36,570 --> 01:57:41,230
 

4493
01:57:36,580 --> 01:57:44,020
 get to the best loss objective it's

4494
01:57:41,220 --> 01:57:44,020
 

4495
01:57:41,230 --> 01:57:50,290
 actually enabled to create more distinct

4496
01:57:44,010 --> 01:57:50,290
 

4497
01:57:44,020 --> 01:57:52,390
 personas and another challenge with this

4498
01:57:50,280 --> 01:57:52,390
 

4499
01:57:50,290 --> 01:57:54,790
 kind of end-to-end dialogue model is

4500
01:57:52,380 --> 01:57:54,790
 

4501
01:57:52,390 --> 01:57:56,590
 like a longer conversation context so I

4502
01:57:54,780 --> 01:57:56,590
 

4503
01:57:54,790 --> 01:57:59,080
 mean if you compare against to machine

4504
01:57:56,580 --> 01:57:59,080
 

4505
01:57:56,590 --> 01:58:00,880
 translation where the input is typically

4506
01:57:59,070 --> 01:58:00,880
 

4507
01:57:59,080 --> 01:58:03,630
 not very super long so it might be

4508
01:58:00,870 --> 01:58:03,630
 

4509
01:58:00,880 --> 01:58:06,400
 sometimes like 50 or 100 words at worst

4510
01:58:03,620 --> 01:58:06,400
 

4511
01:58:03,630 --> 01:58:09,850
 conversation can go on for fairly long

4512
01:58:06,390 --> 01:58:09,850
 

4513
01:58:06,400 --> 01:58:11,920
 time and maybe is 20 or 30 turns so I

4514
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:11,920
 

4515
01:58:09,850 --> 01:58:14,140
 mean we know about from lsdm and gr use

4516
01:58:11,910 --> 01:58:14,140
 

4517
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:15,400
 you kind of actually encode a fairly on

4518
01:58:14,130 --> 01:58:15,400
 

4519
01:58:14,140 --> 01:58:17,560
 context I mean we have been paper

4520
01:58:15,390 --> 01:58:17,560
 

4521
01:58:15,400 --> 01:58:20,620
 showing like trying to to see how much

4522
01:58:17,550 --> 01:58:20,620
 

4523
01:58:17,560 --> 01:58:23,050
 context we can actually encode and but

4524
01:58:20,610 --> 01:58:23,050
 

4525
01:58:20,620 --> 01:58:25,840
 it has a point where maybe what it

4526
01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:25,840
 

4527
01:58:23,050 --> 01:58:27,900
 models is mostly kind of maybe topical

4528
01:58:25,830 --> 01:58:27,900
 

4529
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:31,930
 and does not really remember

4530
01:58:27,890 --> 01:58:31,930
 

4531
01:58:27,900 --> 01:58:34,440
 context but is very long so one popular

4532
01:58:31,920 --> 01:58:34,440
 

4533
01:58:31,930 --> 01:58:35,800
 model is the a trade model Oracle

4534
01:58:34,430 --> 01:58:35,800
 

4535
01:58:34,440 --> 01:58:37,510
 encoder/decoder

4536
01:58:35,790 --> 01:58:37,510
 

4537
01:58:35,800 --> 01:58:39,550
 but has been proposed a few years ago

4538
01:58:37,500 --> 01:58:39,550
 

4539
01:58:37,510 --> 01:58:41,200
 where basically the idea is that in

4540
01:58:39,540 --> 01:58:41,200
 

4541
01:58:39,550 --> 01:58:43,360
 addition to have hidden vector

4542
01:58:41,190 --> 01:58:43,360
 

4543
01:58:41,200 --> 01:58:46,150
 associated with each time step which is

4544
01:58:43,350 --> 01:58:46,150
 

4545
01:58:43,360 --> 01:58:48,370
 the word a word we have a two level

4546
01:58:46,140 --> 01:58:48,370
 

4547
01:58:46,150 --> 01:58:50,680
 hierarchy where you do this as were

4548
01:58:48,360 --> 01:58:50,680
 

4549
01:58:48,370 --> 01:58:53,060
 level but also at the utterance level

4550
01:58:50,670 --> 01:58:53,060
 

4551
01:58:50,680 --> 01:58:56,900
 words so but what is in blue here

4552
01:58:53,050 --> 01:58:56,900
 

4553
01:58:53,060 --> 01:58:59,540
 actually enables you to to collect

4554
01:58:56,890 --> 01:58:59,540
 

4555
01:58:56,900 --> 01:59:02,030
 influences in much faster way let's say

4556
01:58:59,530 --> 01:59:02,030
 

4557
01:58:59,540 --> 01:59:03,860
 so if you have you want to collect the

4558
01:59:02,020 --> 01:59:03,860
 

4559
01:59:02,030 --> 01:59:06,350
 inference from let's say eight turns

4560
01:59:03,850 --> 01:59:06,350
 

4561
01:59:03,860 --> 01:59:08,090
 before when you had you get this through

4562
01:59:06,340 --> 01:59:08,090
 

4563
01:59:06,350 --> 01:59:11,330
 eight hops rather than having this

4564
01:59:08,080 --> 01:59:11,330
 

4565
01:59:08,090 --> 01:59:13,130
 through a large number of words and a

4566
01:59:11,320 --> 01:59:13,130
 

4567
01:59:11,330 --> 01:59:17,990
 variant of this model that's also very

4568
01:59:13,120 --> 01:59:17,990
 

4569
01:59:13,130 --> 01:59:20,180
 popular in n2 and dialog is VA trade

4570
01:59:17,980 --> 01:59:20,180
 

4571
01:59:17,990 --> 01:59:23,300
 model which is later if it adds which

4572
01:59:20,170 --> 01:59:23,300
 

4573
01:59:20,180 --> 01:59:27,500
 adds a latent variable so you have what

4574
01:59:23,290 --> 01:59:27,500
 

4575
01:59:23,300 --> 01:59:29,680
 having blue here is basically stochastic

4576
01:59:27,490 --> 01:59:29,680
 

4577
01:59:27,500 --> 01:59:33,020
 latent variable adding here which is

4578
01:59:29,670 --> 01:59:33,020
 

4579
01:59:29,680 --> 01:59:35,230
 typically modeled as a you have equation

4580
01:59:33,010 --> 01:59:35,230
 

4581
01:59:33,020 --> 01:59:37,610
 variable or some case some case the

4582
01:59:35,220 --> 01:59:37,610
 

4583
01:59:35,230 --> 01:59:41,510
 Gaussian or piecewise constant variable

4584
01:59:37,600 --> 01:59:41,510
 

4585
01:59:37,610 --> 01:59:45,950
 that models the fact that so you have

4586
01:59:41,500 --> 01:59:45,950
 

4587
01:59:41,510 --> 01:59:47,990
 this in the target via D being that you

4588
01:59:45,940 --> 01:59:47,990
 

4589
01:59:45,950 --> 01:59:49,730
 you want to predict when you predict the

4590
01:59:47,980 --> 01:59:49,730
 

4591
01:59:47,990 --> 01:59:51,530
 output you want to say okay maybe I'm

4592
01:59:49,720 --> 01:59:51,530
 

4593
01:59:49,730 --> 01:59:52,880
 gonna predict a variable but can give

4594
01:59:51,520 --> 01:59:52,880
 

4595
01:59:51,530 --> 01:59:55,700
 the gist of we're going to talk about

4596
01:59:52,870 --> 01:59:55,700
 

4597
01:59:52,880 --> 01:59:58,880
 before in terms in the rest of response

4598
01:59:55,690 --> 01:59:58,880
 

4599
01:59:55,700 --> 02:00:00,830
 so if you let's think about this or why

4600
01:59:58,870 --> 02:00:00,830
 

4601
01:59:58,880 --> 02:00:02,360
 we have this variable so if you're not

4602
02:00:00,820 --> 02:00:02,360
 

4603
02:00:00,830 --> 02:00:04,040
 have this variable it's kind of hard you

4604
02:00:02,350 --> 02:00:04,040
 

4605
02:00:02,360 --> 02:00:06,680
 have whether the so called shallow

4606
02:00:04,030 --> 02:00:06,680
 

4607
02:00:04,040 --> 02:00:08,690
 generation process where you you want to

4608
02:00:06,670 --> 02:00:08,690
 

4609
02:00:06,680 --> 02:00:11,660
 give a trait of a given response let's

4610
02:00:08,680 --> 02:00:11,660
 

4611
02:00:08,690 --> 02:00:14,450
 say we want to talk about some news

4612
02:00:11,650 --> 02:00:14,450
 

4613
02:00:11,660 --> 02:00:16,700
 story but the problem is here you're

4614
02:00:14,440 --> 02:00:16,700
 

4615
02:00:14,450 --> 02:00:18,230
 making this station word by word so by

4616
02:00:16,690 --> 02:00:18,230
 

4617
02:00:16,700 --> 02:00:19,520
 the time you maybe you decide to change

4618
02:00:18,220 --> 02:00:19,520
 

4619
02:00:18,230 --> 02:00:22,070
 the first word you might work

4620
02:00:19,510 --> 02:00:22,070
 

4621
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:23,840
 general Volvo and the second word might

4622
02:00:22,060 --> 02:00:23,840
 

4623
02:00:22,070 --> 02:00:26,840
 be something very kind of deflective so

4624
02:00:23,830 --> 02:00:26,840
 

4625
02:00:23,840 --> 02:00:29,510
 but by having this doing step by step is

4626
02:00:26,830 --> 02:00:29,510
 

4627
02:00:26,840 --> 02:00:32,300
 how it's hard to kind of building a

4628
02:00:29,500 --> 02:00:32,300
 

4629
02:00:29,510 --> 02:00:33,770
 really coherent plan of what you're

4630
02:00:32,290 --> 02:00:33,770
 

4631
02:00:32,300 --> 02:00:35,690
 gonna say here but on the other hand if

4632
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:35,690
 

4633
02:00:33,770 --> 02:00:37,430
 your latent variable maybe this VAR

4634
02:00:35,680 --> 02:00:37,430
 

4635
02:00:35,690 --> 02:00:41,030
 latent variable and Kol is kind of a

4636
02:00:37,420 --> 02:00:41,030
 

4637
02:00:37,430 --> 02:00:43,490
 topical or strict like maybe the gist of

4638
02:00:41,020 --> 02:00:43,490
 

4639
02:00:41,030 --> 02:00:45,110
 what the system trying to say vana can

4640
02:00:43,480 --> 02:00:45,110
 

4641
02:00:43,490 --> 02:00:46,820
 just generate but variable and from that

4642
02:00:45,100 --> 02:00:46,820
 

4643
02:00:45,110 --> 02:00:49,310
 variable it can influence all the

4644
02:00:46,810 --> 02:00:49,310
 

4645
02:00:46,820 --> 02:00:52,160
 generation process word by word so it

4646
02:00:49,300 --> 02:00:52,160
 

4647
02:00:49,310 --> 02:00:53,570
 was fun actually having this latent

4648
02:00:52,150 --> 02:00:53,570
 

4649
02:00:52,160 --> 02:00:58,850
 variable actually helps quite a bit in

4650
02:00:53,560 --> 02:00:58,850
 

4651
02:00:53,570 --> 02:01:01,060
 terms of yeah like avoiding blindness in

4652
02:00:58,840 --> 02:01:01,060
 

4653
02:00:58,850 --> 02:01:02,990
 certain sense so and have I been

4654
02:01:01,050 --> 02:01:02,990
 

4655
02:01:01,060 --> 02:01:05,990
 experiments showing that actually this

4656
02:01:02,980 --> 02:01:05,990
 

4657
02:01:02,990 --> 02:01:06,620
 BH read it actually works very well and

4658
02:01:05,980 --> 02:01:06,620
 

4659
02:01:05,990 --> 02:01:09,380
 zactly

4660
02:01:06,610 --> 02:01:09,380
 

4661
02:01:06,620 --> 02:01:13,670
 in a way more useful than the a trade

4662
02:01:09,370 --> 02:01:13,670
 

4663
02:01:09,380 --> 02:01:16,190
 model okay so now I'm gonna turn to

4664
02:01:13,660 --> 02:01:16,190
 

4665
02:01:13,670 --> 02:01:18,020
 another topic of end-to-end dialogue

4666
02:01:16,180 --> 02:01:18,020
 

4667
02:01:16,190 --> 02:01:22,670
 systems we've grounded conversation

4668
02:01:18,010 --> 02:01:22,670
 

4669
02:01:18,020 --> 02:01:26,180
 model so now to make again go a higher

4670
02:01:22,660 --> 02:01:26,180
 

4671
02:01:22,670 --> 02:01:27,530
 level our high-level picture so going

4672
02:01:26,170 --> 02:01:27,530
 

4673
02:01:26,180 --> 02:01:29,210
 back to this distinction between

4674
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:29,210
 

4675
02:01:27,530 --> 02:01:31,700
 traditional more traditional dialogue

4676
02:01:29,200 --> 02:01:31,700
 

4677
02:01:29,210 --> 02:01:33,560
 system of at least like kind of four

4678
02:01:31,690 --> 02:01:33,560
 

4679
02:01:31,700 --> 02:01:35,900
 components or more and fully data-driven

4680
02:01:33,550 --> 02:01:35,900
 

4681
02:01:33,560 --> 02:01:37,970
 system so I mean I've been arguing like

4682
02:01:35,890 --> 02:01:37,970
 

4683
02:01:35,900 --> 02:01:40,630
 well maybe well bottom one is kind of

4684
02:01:37,960 --> 02:01:40,630
 

4685
02:01:37,970 --> 02:01:43,370
 the better way to do this and because

4686
02:01:40,620 --> 02:01:43,370
 

4687
02:01:40,630 --> 02:01:45,110
 well I mean you want a more unified

4688
02:01:43,360 --> 02:01:45,110
 

4689
02:01:43,370 --> 02:01:48,200
 model because bad means well when usage

4690
02:01:45,100 --> 02:01:48,200
 

4691
02:01:45,110 --> 02:01:50,060
 domain or is switch your task it's more

4692
02:01:48,190 --> 02:01:50,060
 

4693
02:01:48,200 --> 02:01:52,700
 it's more easily to switch from one to

4694
02:01:50,050 --> 02:01:52,700
 

4695
02:01:50,060 --> 02:01:54,470
 the other than having something that's

4696
02:01:52,690 --> 02:01:54,470
 

4697
02:01:52,700 --> 02:01:55,580
 higher architecture because if you have

4698
02:01:54,460 --> 02:01:55,580
 

4699
02:01:54,470 --> 02:01:58,550
 something higher architecture you have

4700
02:01:55,570 --> 02:01:58,550
 

4701
02:01:55,580 --> 02:02:00,170
 to write a lot of things but but what's

4702
02:01:58,540 --> 02:02:00,170
 

4703
02:01:58,550 --> 02:02:01,730
 missing from this well clearly I mean

4704
02:02:00,160 --> 02:02:01,730
 

4705
02:02:00,170 --> 02:02:06,020
 it's rates what Jonathan was saying

4706
02:02:01,720 --> 02:02:06,020
 

4707
02:02:01,730 --> 02:02:07,850
 before what what is something at the

4708
02:02:06,010 --> 02:02:07,850
 

4709
02:02:06,020 --> 02:02:10,070
 core of more traditional task oriented

4710
02:02:07,840 --> 02:02:10,070
 

4711
02:02:07,850 --> 02:02:12,560
 dialogue system is that they have this

4712
02:02:10,060 --> 02:02:12,560
 

4713
02:02:10,070 --> 02:02:16,460
 kind of interaction where environment

4714
02:02:12,550 --> 02:02:16,460
 

4715
02:02:12,560 --> 02:02:18,560
 through let's say an API call so if

4716
02:02:16,450 --> 02:02:18,560
 

4717
02:02:16,460 --> 02:02:21,800
 touch connected system where maybe you

4718
02:02:18,550 --> 02:02:21,800
 

4719
02:02:18,560 --> 02:02:25,160
 use it to book a hotel you actually

4720
02:02:21,790 --> 02:02:25,160
 

4721
02:02:21,800 --> 02:02:26,900
 interface this system and you get or

4722
02:02:25,150 --> 02:02:26,900
 

4723
02:02:25,160 --> 02:02:29,150
 let's say take a different example ooh

4724
02:02:26,890 --> 02:02:29,150
 

4725
02:02:26,900 --> 02:02:31,310
 for the Webber report so as the question

4726
02:02:29,140 --> 02:02:31,310
 

4727
02:02:29,150 --> 02:02:33,080
 you ask is like whatsoever tomorrow and

4728
02:02:31,300 --> 02:02:33,080
 

4729
02:02:31,310 --> 02:02:35,630
 you get back from the API maybe some

4730
02:02:33,070 --> 02:02:35,630
 

4731
02:02:33,080 --> 02:02:37,520
 prediction for tomorrow and what's

4732
02:02:35,620 --> 02:02:37,520
 

4733
02:02:35,630 --> 02:02:41,300
 important to have because in a fully

4734
02:02:37,510 --> 02:02:41,300
 

4735
02:02:37,520 --> 02:02:44,870
 end-to-end system well the bad aspect is

4736
02:02:41,290 --> 02:02:44,870
 

4737
02:02:41,300 --> 02:02:47,120
 that while one is model is trained it's

4738
02:02:44,860 --> 02:02:47,120
 

4739
02:02:44,870 --> 02:02:48,620
 this system is fairly deterministic so

4740
02:02:47,110 --> 02:02:48,620
 

4741
02:02:47,120 --> 02:02:50,360
 unless you do something but otherwise a

4742
02:02:48,610 --> 02:02:50,360
 

4743
02:02:48,620 --> 02:02:53,270
 completely deterministic so to a given

4744
02:02:50,350 --> 02:02:53,270
 

4745
02:02:50,360 --> 02:02:55,610
 input you ask it what's very weather

4746
02:02:53,260 --> 02:02:55,610
 

4747
02:02:53,270 --> 02:02:58,220
 tomorrow it's gonna just give you always

4748
02:02:55,600 --> 02:02:58,220
 

4749
02:02:55,610 --> 02:03:00,710
 the same response so in a way the bottom

4750
02:02:58,210 --> 02:03:00,710
 

4751
02:02:58,220 --> 02:03:01,850
 part is maybe more appropriate for I

4752
02:03:00,700 --> 02:03:01,850
 

4753
02:03:00,710 --> 02:03:03,320
 mean viento and approach is more

4754
02:03:01,840 --> 02:03:03,320
 

4755
02:03:01,850 --> 02:03:07,240
 appropriate for a task like machine

4756
02:03:03,310 --> 02:03:07,240
 

4757
02:03:03,320 --> 02:03:08,390
 translation where like sentences are not

4758
02:03:07,230 --> 02:03:08,390
 

4759
02:03:07,240 --> 02:03:10,250
 remain

4760
02:03:08,380 --> 02:03:10,250
 

4761
02:03:08,390 --> 02:03:12,020
 meaning environment but in dialogue do

4762
02:03:10,240 --> 02:03:12,020
 

4763
02:03:10,250 --> 02:03:14,120
 you want something that incorporates

4764
02:03:12,010 --> 02:03:14,120
 

4765
02:03:12,020 --> 02:03:15,950
 knowledge about the environment so there

4766
02:03:14,110 --> 02:03:15,950
 

4767
02:03:14,120 --> 02:03:18,890
 have been a lot of work recently on kind

4768
02:03:15,940 --> 02:03:18,890
 

4769
02:03:15,950 --> 02:03:20,480
 of going beyond just this simple input

4770
02:03:18,880 --> 02:03:20,480
 

4771
02:03:18,890 --> 02:03:22,780
 for this conversation

4772
02:03:20,470 --> 02:03:22,780
 

4773
02:03:20,480 --> 02:03:25,720
 of an extent and input but combines

4774
02:03:22,770 --> 02:03:25,720
 

4775
02:03:22,780 --> 02:03:29,120
 signal with many other things like maybe

4776
02:03:25,710 --> 02:03:29,120
 

4777
02:03:25,720 --> 02:03:31,670
 images or like knowledge from outside

4778
02:03:29,110 --> 02:03:31,670
 

4779
02:03:29,120 --> 02:03:33,950
 world I mean you think about maybe API

4780
02:03:31,660 --> 02:03:33,950
 

4781
02:03:31,670 --> 02:03:35,900
 but maybe more simply like textual in

4782
02:03:33,940 --> 02:03:35,900
 

4783
02:03:33,950 --> 02:03:38,390
 from like textual information coming

4784
02:03:35,890 --> 02:03:38,390
 

4785
02:03:35,900 --> 02:03:40,400
 from let's say Wikipedia and has been

4786
02:03:38,380 --> 02:03:40,400
 

4787
02:03:38,390 --> 02:03:43,010
 really a lot of focus on bhisma dolls

4788
02:03:40,390 --> 02:03:43,010
 

4789
02:03:40,400 --> 02:03:45,290
 but enriched input with a lot of things

4790
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,290
 

4791
02:03:43,010 --> 02:03:47,120
 to actually make this the system's less

4792
02:03:45,280 --> 02:03:47,120
 

4793
02:03:45,290 --> 02:03:50,270
 a feature blind so but it's actually

4794
02:03:47,110 --> 02:03:50,270
 

4795
02:03:47,120 --> 02:03:54,170
 able to do to be give actually much more

4796
02:03:50,260 --> 02:03:54,170
 

4797
02:03:50,270 --> 02:03:58,520
 rich input output and one of the more

4798
02:03:54,160 --> 02:03:58,520
 

4799
02:03:54,170 --> 02:04:01,610
 with earlier effort in building such a

4800
02:03:58,510 --> 02:04:01,610
 

4801
02:03:58,520 --> 02:04:03,950
 more grounded model is a simple model

4802
02:04:01,600 --> 02:04:03,950
 

4803
02:04:01,610 --> 02:04:05,390
 which is sometimes called knowledge

4804
02:04:03,940 --> 02:04:05,390
 

4805
02:04:03,950 --> 02:04:07,340
 grounded conversation models so

4806
02:04:05,380 --> 02:04:07,340
 

4807
02:04:05,390 --> 02:04:10,790
 basically let's say I mean you starting

4808
02:04:07,330 --> 02:04:10,790
 

4809
02:04:07,340 --> 02:04:13,150
 maybe with a fully kind of with bare

4810
02:04:10,780 --> 02:04:13,150
 

4811
02:04:10,790 --> 02:04:15,530
 bone lsdm based model for example and

4812
02:04:13,140 --> 02:04:15,530
 

4813
02:04:13,150 --> 02:04:17,810
 you have an instance like this where if

4814
02:04:15,520 --> 02:04:17,810
 

4815
02:04:15,530 --> 02:04:19,670
 input is going to kusakabe tonight where

4816
02:04:17,800 --> 02:04:19,670
 

4817
02:04:17,810 --> 02:04:21,920
 jacobeans happened to be a Japanese

4818
02:04:19,660 --> 02:04:21,920
 

4819
02:04:19,670 --> 02:04:24,920
 restaurant and ideally you want to

4820
02:04:21,910 --> 02:04:24,920
 

4821
02:04:21,920 --> 02:04:27,170
 response like we try oh macha say the

4822
02:04:24,910 --> 02:04:27,170
 

4823
02:04:24,920 --> 02:04:28,910
 best in town but with correct model

4824
02:04:27,160 --> 02:04:28,910
 

4825
02:04:27,170 --> 02:04:31,160
 series really I mean in two and maloo

4826
02:04:28,900 --> 02:04:31,160
 

4827
02:04:28,910 --> 02:04:33,110
 Vedran it was really no way you can get

4828
02:04:31,150 --> 02:04:33,110
 

4829
02:04:31,160 --> 02:04:34,700
 such a rich response without a kind of

4830
02:04:33,100 --> 02:04:34,700
 

4831
02:04:33,110 --> 02:04:37,460
 knowledge from the world because I mean

4832
02:04:34,690 --> 02:04:37,460
 

4833
02:04:34,700 --> 02:04:39,020
 first we system or maybe even myself I

4834
02:04:37,450 --> 02:04:39,020
 

4835
02:04:37,460 --> 02:04:43,310
 don't know anything about this venue so

4836
02:04:39,010 --> 02:04:43,310
 

4837
02:04:39,020 --> 02:04:45,320
 how do I know what's good there so so

4838
02:04:43,300 --> 02:04:45,320
 

4839
02:04:43,310 --> 02:04:47,180
 one way one approach is say well okay

4840
02:04:45,310 --> 02:04:47,180
 

4841
02:04:45,320 --> 02:04:49,070
 maybe use the context to find all the

4842
02:04:47,170 --> 02:04:49,070
 

4843
02:04:47,180 --> 02:04:51,290
 kind of strings for our like a sentence

4844
02:04:49,060 --> 02:04:51,290
 

4845
02:04:49,070 --> 02:04:52,790
 that are relevant to what context and

4846
02:04:51,280 --> 02:04:52,790
 

4847
02:04:51,290 --> 02:04:54,710
 let's say you have an IR based system

4848
02:04:52,780 --> 02:04:54,710
 

4849
02:04:52,790 --> 02:04:56,420
 but kind of select this piece of

4850
02:04:54,700 --> 02:04:56,420
 

4851
02:04:54,710 --> 02:04:57,980
 knowledge that are relevant and then you

4852
02:04:56,410 --> 02:04:57,980
 

4853
02:04:56,420 --> 02:04:59,600
 have a fact encoder

4854
02:04:57,970 --> 02:04:59,600
 

4855
02:04:57,980 --> 02:05:03,140
 I mean so-called facts encoder but kind

4856
02:04:59,590 --> 02:05:03,140
 

4857
02:04:59,600 --> 02:05:05,960
 of build a vector representation of this

4858
02:05:03,130 --> 02:05:05,960
 

4859
02:05:03,140 --> 02:05:07,760
 different input and actually generate a

4860
02:05:05,950 --> 02:05:07,760
 

4861
02:05:05,960 --> 02:05:09,580
 response so I mean you have it let's say

4862
02:05:07,750 --> 02:05:09,580
 

4863
02:05:07,760 --> 02:05:11,900
 you have things like here but our drone

4864
02:05:09,570 --> 02:05:11,900
 

4865
02:05:09,580 --> 02:05:14,030
 like fact for the drone from large

4866
02:05:11,890 --> 02:05:14,030
 

4867
02:05:11,900 --> 02:05:16,280
 databases and I said maybe use an AR

4868
02:05:14,020 --> 02:05:16,280
 

4869
02:05:14,030 --> 02:05:17,900
 system to actually generate this but the

4870
02:05:16,270 --> 02:05:17,900
 

4871
02:05:16,280 --> 02:05:20,510
 idea here is like to use something akin

4872
02:05:17,890 --> 02:05:20,510
 

4873
02:05:17,900 --> 02:05:22,430
 to a memory Network where basically for

4874
02:05:20,500 --> 02:05:22,430
 

4875
02:05:20,510 --> 02:05:24,470
 a given context you would kind of rank

4876
02:05:22,420 --> 02:05:24,470
 

4877
02:05:22,430 --> 02:05:26,240
 what are the different pieces of

4878
02:05:24,460 --> 02:05:26,240
 

4879
02:05:24,470 --> 02:05:29,360
 information but the Redmayne to an

4880
02:05:26,230 --> 02:05:29,360
 

4881
02:05:26,240 --> 02:05:31,550
 output and I mean that's what the memory

4882
02:05:29,350 --> 02:05:31,550
 

4883
02:05:29,360 --> 02:05:33,050
 Network does basically it represented a

4884
02:05:31,540 --> 02:05:33,050
 

4885
02:05:31,550 --> 02:05:36,860
 question which is here like

4886
02:05:33,040 --> 02:05:36,860
 

4887
02:05:33,050 --> 02:05:41,449
 history and weights but different facts

4888
02:05:36,850 --> 02:05:41,449
 

4889
02:05:36,860 --> 02:05:43,040
 for it and then built embedding

4890
02:05:41,439 --> 02:05:43,040
 

4891
02:05:41,449 --> 02:05:44,780
 representation here but it's weighted by

4892
02:05:43,030 --> 02:05:44,780
 

4893
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:46,250
 how much it thinks each fact is really

4894
02:05:44,770 --> 02:05:46,250
 

4895
02:05:44,780 --> 02:05:48,530
 matter mean generates a vector and then

4896
02:05:46,240 --> 02:05:48,530
 

4897
02:05:46,250 --> 02:05:50,329
 it's being coke addicted to the dalek

4898
02:05:48,520 --> 02:05:50,329
 

4899
02:05:48,530 --> 02:05:53,360
 encoder representation and when it

4900
02:05:50,319 --> 02:05:53,360
 

4901
02:05:50,329 --> 02:05:55,340
 generates a response so and the nice

4902
02:05:53,350 --> 02:05:55,340
 

4903
02:05:53,360 --> 02:05:58,250
 thing here is like you actually have the

4904
02:05:55,330 --> 02:05:58,250
 

4905
02:05:55,340 --> 02:06:00,230
 ability to kind of round or like side

4906
02:05:58,240 --> 02:06:00,230
 

4907
02:05:58,250 --> 02:06:03,829
 load information coming from some other

4908
02:06:00,220 --> 02:06:03,829
 

4909
02:06:00,230 --> 02:06:05,869
 source so it's it's the output is no

4910
02:06:03,819 --> 02:06:05,869
 

4911
02:06:03,829 --> 02:06:08,119
 longer invariant so these are some

4912
02:06:05,859 --> 02:06:08,119
 

4913
02:06:05,869 --> 02:06:10,610
 examples where you can see that I mean

4914
02:06:08,109 --> 02:06:10,610
 

4915
02:06:08,119 --> 02:06:13,849
 first in blue here you can see it keeps

4916
02:06:10,600 --> 02:06:13,849
 

4917
02:06:10,610 --> 02:06:15,650
 with ability to kind of be socially

4918
02:06:13,839 --> 02:06:15,650
 

4919
02:06:13,849 --> 02:06:17,780
 appropriate yeah but the blue part is

4920
02:06:15,640 --> 02:06:17,780
 

4921
02:06:15,650 --> 02:06:20,150
 more like in two Vanilla's the

4922
02:06:17,770 --> 02:06:20,150
 

4923
02:06:17,780 --> 02:06:21,530
 consequence model but if you provide the

4924
02:06:20,140 --> 02:06:21,530
 

4925
02:06:20,150 --> 02:06:24,440
 grounding in red here

4926
02:06:21,520 --> 02:06:24,440
 

4927
02:06:21,530 --> 02:06:27,800
 You certainly have this ability to to

4928
02:06:24,430 --> 02:06:27,800
 

4929
02:06:24,440 --> 02:06:30,170
 inject more meaning into the output in a

4930
02:06:27,790 --> 02:06:30,170
 

4931
02:06:27,800 --> 02:06:31,730
 way that it's very flexible because if

4932
02:06:30,160 --> 02:06:31,730
 

4933
02:06:30,170 --> 02:06:32,780
 you change the grounding it will the

4934
02:06:31,720 --> 02:06:32,780
 

4935
02:06:31,730 --> 02:06:34,849
 system will give you a different

4936
02:06:32,770 --> 02:06:34,849
 

4937
02:06:32,780 --> 02:06:37,929
 response and I think that's kind of

4938
02:06:34,839 --> 02:06:37,929
 

4939
02:06:34,849 --> 02:06:40,489
 great for in terms of flexibility so and

4940
02:06:37,919 --> 02:06:40,489
 

4941
02:06:37,929 --> 02:06:43,730
 the previous slides were about more kind

4942
02:06:40,479 --> 02:06:43,730
 

4943
02:06:40,489 --> 02:06:46,369
 of firm very more snippety kind of input

4944
02:06:43,720 --> 02:06:46,369
 

4945
02:06:43,730 --> 02:06:48,380
 where you have give chunks of strings

4946
02:06:46,359 --> 02:06:48,380
 

4947
02:06:46,369 --> 02:06:49,880
 what might be relevant but I think

4948
02:06:48,370 --> 02:06:49,880
 

4949
02:06:48,380 --> 02:06:52,300
 what's interesting here and it relates

4950
02:06:49,870 --> 02:06:52,300
 

4951
02:06:49,880 --> 02:06:55,219
 to what Jonathan was saying where to

4952
02:06:52,290 --> 02:06:55,219
 

4953
02:06:52,300 --> 02:06:57,320
 with MRC or machine reading compression

4954
02:06:55,209 --> 02:06:57,320
 

4955
02:06:55,219 --> 02:06:58,760
 models where let's say the input is

4956
02:06:57,310 --> 02:06:58,760
 

4957
02:06:57,320 --> 02:07:02,780
 actually much richer it let's say it's a

4958
02:06:58,750 --> 02:07:02,780
 

4959
02:06:58,760 --> 02:07:04,250
 full document so the task here is say

4960
02:07:02,770 --> 02:07:04,250
 

4961
02:07:02,780 --> 02:07:05,780
 well I'm still want to have a

4962
02:07:04,240 --> 02:07:05,780
 

4963
02:07:04,250 --> 02:07:08,960
 conversation but let's have input is not

4964
02:07:05,770 --> 02:07:08,960
 

4965
02:07:05,780 --> 02:07:11,360
 just a document but sorry a bunch of

4966
02:07:08,950 --> 02:07:11,360
 

4967
02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:13,940
 small simple text but it's a document or

4968
02:07:11,350 --> 02:07:13,940
 

4969
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:16,280
 maybe have a full of Wikipedia and the

4970
02:07:13,930 --> 02:07:16,280
 

4971
02:07:13,940 --> 02:07:17,449
 goal here is to generate good response

4972
02:07:16,270 --> 02:07:17,449
 

4973
02:07:16,280 --> 02:07:20,869
 what kind of inference but if this

4974
02:07:17,439 --> 02:07:20,869
 

4975
02:07:17,449 --> 02:07:23,989
 document like documents and one of the

4976
02:07:20,859 --> 02:07:23,989
 

4977
02:07:20,869 --> 02:07:25,940
 models do that are I mean so I've been

4978
02:07:23,979 --> 02:07:25,940
 

4979
02:07:23,989 --> 02:07:27,380
 actually already like two papers at

4980
02:07:25,930 --> 02:07:27,380
 

4981
02:07:25,940 --> 02:07:31,250
 least two papers work on this kind of

4982
02:07:27,370 --> 02:07:31,250
 

4983
02:07:27,380 --> 02:07:33,230
 framework where the ID but grounding is

4984
02:07:31,240 --> 02:07:33,230
 

4985
02:07:31,250 --> 02:07:37,040
 some rich document could be a Wikipedia

4986
02:07:33,220 --> 02:07:37,040
 

4987
02:07:33,230 --> 02:07:40,820
 article and so I mean one of these model

4988
02:07:37,030 --> 02:07:40,820
 

4989
02:07:37,040 --> 02:07:43,489
 is with upcoming ACL paper from chin at

4990
02:07:40,810 --> 02:07:43,489
 

4991
02:07:40,820 --> 02:07:45,210
 all which is basically the ID we take

4992
02:07:43,479 --> 02:07:45,210
 

4993
02:07:43,489 --> 02:07:49,020
 they take

4994
02:07:45,200 --> 02:07:49,020
 

4995
02:07:45,210 --> 02:07:52,440
 a machine reading compression model and

4996
02:07:49,010 --> 02:07:52,440
 

4997
02:07:49,020 --> 02:07:55,410
 and actually but has the ability to

4998
02:07:52,430 --> 02:07:55,410
 

4999
02:07:52,440 --> 02:07:57,120
 generate a response so the emergency

5000
02:07:55,400 --> 02:07:57,120
 

5001
02:07:55,410 --> 02:08:00,990
 model initially was one that kind of

5002
02:07:57,110 --> 02:08:00,990
 

5003
02:07:57,120 --> 02:08:03,090
 abide to the MRC task but based even a

5004
02:08:00,980 --> 02:08:03,090
 

5005
02:08:00,990 --> 02:08:05,130
 query and a document you generate it

5006
02:08:03,080 --> 02:08:05,130
 

5007
02:08:03,090 --> 02:08:07,620
 will identify passage within document

5008
02:08:05,120 --> 02:08:07,620
 

5009
02:08:05,130 --> 02:08:10,410
 but can answers the question but here

5010
02:08:07,610 --> 02:08:10,410
 

5011
02:08:07,620 --> 02:08:12,450
 it's kind of it was modified so that the

5012
02:08:10,400 --> 02:08:12,450
 

5013
02:08:10,410 --> 02:08:14,880
 output module is actually not one but

5014
02:08:12,440 --> 02:08:14,880
 

5015
02:08:12,450 --> 02:08:17,400
 simply highlight a given sentence in

5016
02:08:14,870 --> 02:08:17,400
 

5017
02:08:14,880 --> 02:08:20,580
 document but actually does both address

5018
02:08:17,390 --> 02:08:20,580
 

5019
02:08:17,400 --> 02:08:21,990
 both tasks of MRC and respond generation

5020
02:08:20,570 --> 02:08:21,990
 

5021
02:08:20,580 --> 02:08:26,130
 where it actually generates a response

5022
02:08:21,980 --> 02:08:26,130
 

5023
02:08:21,990 --> 02:08:28,290
 that contains some facts or relevant

5024
02:08:26,120 --> 02:08:28,290
 

5025
02:08:26,130 --> 02:08:30,330
 pieces from the document but without

5026
02:08:28,280 --> 02:08:30,330
 

5027
02:08:28,290 --> 02:08:32,970
 just parting it just integrates with two

5028
02:08:30,320 --> 02:08:32,970
 

5029
02:08:30,330 --> 02:08:37,650
 knowledge sources and into a current

5030
02:08:32,960 --> 02:08:37,650
 

5031
02:08:32,970 --> 02:08:40,410
 response and yeah and it had been also

5032
02:08:37,640 --> 02:08:40,410
 

5033
02:08:37,650 --> 02:08:44,550
 other forms of grinding so so far it was

5034
02:08:40,400 --> 02:08:44,550
 

5035
02:08:40,410 --> 02:08:47,520
 mostly about text but here it's yeah

5036
02:08:44,540 --> 02:08:47,520
 

5037
02:08:44,550 --> 02:08:50,400
 that can be richer rounding such as

5038
02:08:47,510 --> 02:08:50,400
 

5039
02:08:47,520 --> 02:08:52,380
 images where let's say you have a

5040
02:08:50,390 --> 02:08:52,380
 

5041
02:08:50,400 --> 02:08:57,720
 conversation around an image were asking

5042
02:08:52,370 --> 02:08:57,720
 

5043
02:08:52,380 --> 02:09:00,210
 questions so where is this paper called

5044
02:08:57,710 --> 02:09:00,210
 

5045
02:08:57,720 --> 02:09:02,430
 visual dialogue from does at all that

5046
02:09:00,200 --> 02:09:02,430
 

5047
02:09:00,210 --> 02:09:05,460
 it's a series of question answer about

5048
02:09:02,420 --> 02:09:05,460
 

5049
02:09:02,430 --> 02:09:08,850
 an image and but also this other paper

5050
02:09:05,450 --> 02:09:08,850
 

5051
02:09:05,460 --> 02:09:11,130
 here about having a bit more open-ended

5052
02:09:08,840 --> 02:09:11,130
 

5053
02:09:08,850 --> 02:09:13,260
 conversation about a given context but

5054
02:09:11,120 --> 02:09:13,260
 

5055
02:09:11,130 --> 02:09:14,670
 it's an image and more recently I've

5056
02:09:13,250 --> 02:09:14,670
 

5057
02:09:13,260 --> 02:09:16,920
 been working on actually granting an

5058
02:09:14,660 --> 02:09:16,920
 

5059
02:09:14,670 --> 02:09:20,370
 effect so let's say well maybe you've

5060
02:09:16,910 --> 02:09:20,370
 

5061
02:09:16,920 --> 02:09:22,860
 camera and maybe let's say you use a

5062
02:09:20,360 --> 02:09:22,860
 

5063
02:09:20,370 --> 02:09:24,360
 serie or cortana and it can actually see

5064
02:09:22,850 --> 02:09:24,360
 

5065
02:09:22,860 --> 02:09:26,820
 your face and maybe see your facial

5066
02:09:24,350 --> 02:09:26,820
 

5067
02:09:24,360 --> 02:09:28,800
 expression maybe knowing that could be

5068
02:09:26,810 --> 02:09:28,800
 

5069
02:09:26,820 --> 02:09:32,580
 useful to actually kind of responds

5070
02:09:28,790 --> 02:09:32,580
 

5071
02:09:28,800 --> 02:09:38,730
 differently and but what this paper was

5072
02:09:32,570 --> 02:09:38,730
 

5073
02:09:32,580 --> 02:09:41,190
 about and so so beyond supervised

5074
02:09:38,720 --> 02:09:41,190
 

5075
02:09:38,730 --> 02:09:43,230
 learning so everything so far in my

5076
02:09:41,180 --> 02:09:43,230
 

5077
02:09:41,190 --> 02:09:44,850
 section have been about supervised

5078
02:09:43,220 --> 02:09:44,850
 

5079
02:09:43,230 --> 02:09:46,980
 learning I can see from Jenkins part

5080
02:09:44,840 --> 02:09:46,980
 

5081
02:09:44,850 --> 02:09:48,300
 actually a lot of earlier work was not

5082
02:09:46,970 --> 02:09:48,300
 

5083
02:09:46,980 --> 02:09:49,890
 just doing the supervised learning I

5084
02:09:48,290 --> 02:09:49,890
 

5085
02:09:48,300 --> 02:09:52,380
 mean reinforcement learning is actually

5086
02:09:49,880 --> 02:09:52,380
 

5087
02:09:49,890 --> 02:09:54,210
 a critical part so in the end-to-end

5088
02:09:52,370 --> 02:09:54,210
 

5089
02:09:52,380 --> 02:09:57,090
 context what's the limitation of

5090
02:09:54,200 --> 02:09:57,090
 

5091
02:09:54,210 --> 02:09:58,090
 supervised learning well first a lot of

5092
02:09:57,080 --> 02:09:58,090
 

5093
02:09:57,090 --> 02:09:59,800
 the data is actually

5094
02:09:58,080 --> 02:09:59,800
 

5095
02:09:58,090 --> 02:10:01,690
 coming from human to human conversation

5096
02:09:59,790 --> 02:10:01,690
 

5097
02:09:59,800 --> 02:10:04,450
 so you have let's say two things take

5098
02:10:01,680 --> 02:10:04,450
 

5099
02:10:01,690 --> 02:10:06,790
 things from Twitter reddit and assumin

5100
02:10:04,440 --> 02:10:06,790
 

5101
02:10:04,450 --> 02:10:10,060
 to a human and it's not really one the

5102
02:10:06,780 --> 02:10:10,060
 

5103
02:10:06,790 --> 02:10:12,370
 agent is not usually part of of a pair

5104
02:10:10,050 --> 02:10:12,370
 

5105
02:10:10,060 --> 02:10:14,110
 and it's typically optimizing the

5106
02:10:12,360 --> 02:10:14,110
 

5107
02:10:12,370 --> 02:10:16,210
 current immediate reward of a given

5108
02:10:14,100 --> 02:10:16,210
 

5109
02:10:14,110 --> 02:10:18,340
 response given the conversation history

5110
02:10:16,200 --> 02:10:18,340
 

5111
02:10:16,210 --> 02:10:19,900
 so it cannot model the fact that well

5112
02:10:18,330 --> 02:10:19,900
 

5113
02:10:18,340 --> 02:10:21,640
 maybe a conversation might not go very

5114
02:10:19,890 --> 02:10:21,640
 

5115
02:10:19,900 --> 02:10:23,860
 well along the way but at the end of a

5116
02:10:21,630 --> 02:10:23,860
 

5117
02:10:21,640 --> 02:10:26,590
 conversation and it reaches his goal so

5118
02:10:23,850 --> 02:10:26,590
 

5119
02:10:23,860 --> 02:10:29,050
 it's kind of too limited and varies also

5120
02:10:26,580 --> 02:10:29,050
 

5121
02:10:26,590 --> 02:10:30,850
 no user feedback so having work and

5122
02:10:29,040 --> 02:10:30,850
 

5123
02:10:29,050 --> 02:10:32,950
 trying to exploit more kind of aural

5124
02:10:30,840 --> 02:10:32,950
 

5125
02:10:30,850 --> 02:10:35,770
 kind of setting for end to end dialogue

5126
02:10:32,940 --> 02:10:35,770
 

5127
02:10:32,950 --> 02:10:37,800
 and one case was different from learning

5128
02:10:35,760 --> 02:10:37,800
 

5129
02:10:35,770 --> 02:10:41,050
 of four and to enter log paper from a

5130
02:10:37,790 --> 02:10:41,050
 

5131
02:10:37,800 --> 02:10:43,330
 little at M&P or basically they use for

5132
02:10:41,040 --> 02:10:43,330
 

5133
02:10:41,050 --> 02:10:45,940
 a reinforced algorithm and the goal

5134
02:10:43,320 --> 02:10:45,940
 

5135
02:10:43,330 --> 02:10:48,010
 there was to maximize expected the

5136
02:10:45,930 --> 02:10:48,010
 

5137
02:10:45,940 --> 02:10:49,720
 reward of a conversation and I mean it

5138
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:49,720
 

5139
02:10:48,010 --> 02:10:51,940
 is fairly kind of stand on the reinforce

5140
02:10:49,710 --> 02:10:51,940
 

5141
02:10:49,720 --> 02:10:54,730
 here but the idea here is like well

5142
02:10:51,930 --> 02:10:54,730
 

5143
02:10:51,940 --> 02:10:57,520
 let's say well you can you optimize with

5144
02:10:54,720 --> 02:10:57,520
 

5145
02:10:54,730 --> 02:10:59,890
 gradient descent and reciprocally is

5146
02:10:57,510 --> 02:10:59,890
 

5147
02:10:57,520 --> 02:11:04,450
 what we use one sample at the time were

5148
02:10:59,880 --> 02:11:04,450
 

5149
02:10:59,890 --> 02:11:05,890
 basically vectorize here we read the

5150
02:11:04,440 --> 02:11:05,890
 

5151
02:11:04,450 --> 02:11:08,170
 term here award function with

5152
02:11:05,880 --> 02:11:08,170
 

5153
02:11:05,890 --> 02:11:10,210
 independent of the model parameters and

5154
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:10,210
 

5155
02:11:08,170 --> 02:11:14,980
 also the likelihood the behavin

5156
02:11:10,200 --> 02:11:14,980
 

5157
02:11:10,210 --> 02:11:16,420
 conversation given yeah but we've

5158
02:11:14,970 --> 02:11:16,420
 

5159
02:11:14,980 --> 02:11:17,980
 current like to look likelihood

5160
02:11:16,410 --> 02:11:17,980
 

5161
02:11:16,420 --> 02:11:19,990
 according to the model and then you can

5162
02:11:17,970 --> 02:11:19,990
 

5163
02:11:17,980 --> 02:11:23,100
 factorize this nicely where this is

5164
02:11:19,980 --> 02:11:23,100
 

5165
02:11:19,990 --> 02:11:26,110
 actually what you're trying to learn so

5166
02:11:23,090 --> 02:11:26,110
 

5167
02:11:23,100 --> 02:11:27,640
 fix that was very fairly prominent work

5168
02:11:26,100 --> 02:11:27,640
 

5169
02:11:26,110 --> 02:11:32,050
 but they experiment with different kind

5170
02:11:27,630 --> 02:11:32,050
 

5171
02:11:27,640 --> 02:11:34,570
 of settings but directly at different

5172
02:11:32,040 --> 02:11:34,570
 

5173
02:11:32,050 --> 02:11:35,800
 work functions but address the

5174
02:11:34,560 --> 02:11:35,800
 

5175
02:11:34,570 --> 02:11:39,760
 limitation of supervised learning

5176
02:11:35,790 --> 02:11:39,760
 

5177
02:11:35,800 --> 02:11:41,890
 settings so as I said in supervised

5178
02:11:39,750 --> 02:11:41,890
 

5179
02:11:39,760 --> 02:11:44,470
 learning conversation there are a lot of

5180
02:11:41,880 --> 02:11:44,470
 

5181
02:11:41,890 --> 02:11:45,730
 kind of more dull responses so one upper

5182
02:11:44,460 --> 02:11:45,730
 

5183
02:11:44,470 --> 02:11:48,130
 work function is to kind of mitigate

5184
02:11:45,720 --> 02:11:48,130
 

5185
02:11:45,730 --> 02:11:51,580
 this to kind of penalize response for

5186
02:11:48,120 --> 02:11:51,580
 

5187
02:11:48,130 --> 02:11:54,130
 adult but also another reward function

5188
02:11:51,570 --> 02:11:54,130
 

5189
02:11:51,580 --> 02:11:57,370
 information flow we're trying to see

5190
02:11:54,120 --> 02:11:57,370
 

5191
02:11:54,130 --> 02:11:59,170
 well trying to avoid but but

5192
02:11:57,360 --> 02:11:59,170
 

5193
02:11:57,370 --> 02:12:00,820
 conversation remain over and over about

5194
02:11:59,160 --> 02:12:00,820
 

5195
02:11:59,170 --> 02:12:04,630
 the same topic because sometimes you can

5196
02:12:00,810 --> 02:12:04,630
 

5197
02:12:00,820 --> 02:12:07,930
 get a bit circular we're agents and keep

5198
02:12:04,620 --> 02:12:07,930
 

5199
02:12:04,630 --> 02:12:11,480
 repeating what the user says and well

5200
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:11,480
 

5201
02:12:07,930 --> 02:12:15,140
 and the third reward function

5202
02:12:11,470 --> 02:12:15,140
 

5203
02:12:11,480 --> 02:12:16,880
 meaningfulness Oh make I mean if you try

5204
02:12:15,130 --> 02:12:16,880
 

5205
02:12:15,140 --> 02:12:19,460
 to promote too much diversity what

5206
02:12:16,870 --> 02:12:19,460
 

5207
02:12:16,880 --> 02:12:20,750
 happens maybe the system starts changing

5208
02:12:19,450 --> 02:12:20,750
 

5209
02:12:19,460 --> 02:12:22,820
 topic too often so you have also another

5210
02:12:20,740 --> 02:12:22,820
 

5211
02:12:20,750 --> 02:12:25,820
 parameters here to kind of mitigate

5212
02:12:22,810 --> 02:12:25,820
 

5213
02:12:22,820 --> 02:12:29,150
 words and so one way to say and to see

5214
02:12:25,810 --> 02:12:29,150
 

5215
02:12:25,820 --> 02:12:30,710
 whether the system gets better is to say

5216
02:12:29,140 --> 02:12:30,710
 

5217
02:12:29,150 --> 02:12:32,840
 well it's a bit worse setting but you

5218
02:12:30,700 --> 02:12:32,840
 

5219
02:12:30,710 --> 02:12:35,449
 get a bot you get to talk to one of your

5220
02:12:32,830 --> 02:12:35,449
 

5221
02:12:32,840 --> 02:12:36,980
 BOTS and say that's a bit a way to see

5222
02:12:35,439 --> 02:12:36,980
 

5223
02:12:35,449 --> 02:12:41,270
 if we can get away from Eastern and

5224
02:12:36,970 --> 02:12:41,270
 

5225
02:12:36,980 --> 02:12:42,800
 service system to be more reactive so if

5226
02:12:41,260 --> 02:12:42,800
 

5227
02:12:41,270 --> 02:12:44,480
 you do that without reinforcement Ling I

5228
02:12:42,790 --> 02:12:44,480
 

5229
02:12:42,800 --> 02:12:48,560
 mean it gets sometimes in a really kind

5230
02:12:44,470 --> 02:12:48,560
 

5231
02:12:44,480 --> 02:12:50,030
 of nonsensical loop where this one about

5232
02:12:48,550 --> 02:12:50,030
 

5233
02:12:48,560 --> 02:12:51,350
 says see you later and you respond see

5234
02:12:50,020 --> 02:12:51,350
 

5235
02:12:50,030 --> 02:12:54,320
 you later see really so it's not really

5236
02:12:51,340 --> 02:12:54,320
 

5237
02:12:51,350 --> 02:12:55,969
 going anywhere and well if you use

5238
02:12:54,310 --> 02:12:55,969
 

5239
02:12:54,320 --> 02:12:58,040
 reinforced modeling and see here but

5240
02:12:55,959 --> 02:12:58,040
 

5241
02:12:55,969 --> 02:12:59,929
 we're more going towards a system that

5242
02:12:58,030 --> 02:12:59,929
 

5243
02:12:58,040 --> 02:13:02,410
 is more proactive and responds more

5244
02:12:59,919 --> 02:13:02,410
 

5245
02:12:59,929 --> 02:13:04,550
 meaningfully so let's say the

5246
02:13:02,400 --> 02:13:04,550
 

5247
02:13:02,410 --> 02:13:06,800
 conversation initiated with how are you

5248
02:13:04,540 --> 02:13:06,800
 

5249
02:13:04,550 --> 02:13:08,600
 how old are you and then this one for

5250
02:13:06,790 --> 02:13:08,600
 

5251
02:13:06,800 --> 02:13:10,610
 why are you asking about you were 12

5252
02:13:08,590 --> 02:13:10,610
 

5253
02:13:08,600 --> 02:13:12,739
 what made me made you think so so you

5254
02:13:10,600 --> 02:13:12,739
 

5255
02:13:10,610 --> 02:13:14,120
 can see it's kind of goes more in a

5256
02:13:12,729 --> 02:13:14,120
 

5257
02:13:12,739 --> 02:13:15,650
 sensible direction of reinforced

5258
02:13:14,110 --> 02:13:15,650
 

5259
02:13:14,120 --> 02:13:17,750
 modeling and again but that's a

5260
02:13:15,640 --> 02:13:17,750
 

5261
02:13:15,650 --> 02:13:20,060
 real-world an actual example from the

5262
02:13:17,740 --> 02:13:20,060
 

5263
02:13:17,750 --> 02:13:22,280
 system but at some point oftentimes

5264
02:13:20,050 --> 02:13:22,280
 

5265
02:13:20,060 --> 02:13:23,719
 there will be a point where well the

5266
02:13:22,270 --> 02:13:23,719
 

5267
02:13:22,280 --> 02:13:26,300
 conversation kind of falls apart but

5268
02:13:23,709 --> 02:13:26,300
 

5269
02:13:23,719 --> 02:13:28,370
 that's kind of it's still better than

5270
02:13:26,290 --> 02:13:28,370
 

5271
02:13:26,300 --> 02:13:29,840
 studying woofers supervised during the

5272
02:13:28,360 --> 02:13:29,840
 

5273
02:13:28,370 --> 02:13:32,030
 system but would fall apart or mode

5274
02:13:29,830 --> 02:13:32,030
 

5275
02:13:29,840 --> 02:13:34,610
 immediately and the system preferred

5276
02:13:32,020 --> 02:13:34,610
 

5277
02:13:32,030 --> 02:13:36,500
 reinforcement learning compared to a

5278
02:13:34,600 --> 02:13:36,500
 

5279
02:13:34,610 --> 02:13:41,570
 supervisor running in 72 percent of the

5280
02:13:36,490 --> 02:13:41,570
 

5281
02:13:36,500 --> 02:13:44,380
 cases okay I guess I should start pretty

5282
02:13:41,560 --> 02:13:44,380
 

5283
02:13:41,570 --> 02:13:47,390
 soon but I mentioned something about

5284
02:13:44,370 --> 02:13:47,390
 

5285
02:13:44,380 --> 02:13:48,830
 datasets and kind of competitions around

5286
02:13:47,380 --> 02:13:48,830
 

5287
02:13:47,390 --> 02:13:50,090
 this and what could use if you're

5288
02:13:48,820 --> 02:13:50,090
 

5289
02:13:48,830 --> 02:13:50,860
 interested in that space what you can do

5290
02:13:50,080 --> 02:13:50,860
 

5291
02:13:50,090 --> 02:13:53,870
 so

5292
02:13:50,850 --> 02:13:53,870
 

5293
02:13:50,860 --> 02:13:55,489
 I mean mentioned in the beginning but

5294
02:13:53,860 --> 02:13:55,489
 

5295
02:13:53,870 --> 02:13:57,650
 still like a lot of resource in that

5296
02:13:55,479 --> 02:13:57,650
 

5297
02:13:55,489 --> 02:13:59,870
 space in terms of resources I mean

5298
02:13:57,640 --> 02:13:59,870
 

5299
02:13:57,650 --> 02:14:01,370
 people have been using a lot like Reddit

5300
02:13:59,860 --> 02:14:01,370
 

5301
02:13:59,870 --> 02:14:03,170
 and Twitter there's also open subtitles

5302
02:14:01,360 --> 02:14:03,170
 

5303
02:14:01,370 --> 02:14:05,530
 the nice feature of was that I said

5304
02:14:03,160 --> 02:14:05,530
 

5305
02:14:03,170 --> 02:14:07,820
 absolutely huge the answer and more like

5306
02:14:05,520 --> 02:14:07,820
 

5307
02:14:05,530 --> 02:14:10,310
 they're more informal and maybe

5308
02:14:07,810 --> 02:14:10,310
 

5309
02:14:07,820 --> 02:14:13,760
 sometimes not too rich in terms of

5310
02:14:10,300 --> 02:14:13,760
 

5311
02:14:10,310 --> 02:14:17,510
 content there's also good to corpus

5312
02:14:13,750 --> 02:14:17,510
 

5313
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:20,540
 which is kind of more specific about OS

5314
02:14:17,500 --> 02:14:20,540
 

5315
02:14:17,510 --> 02:14:23,359
 specific issues and Rubin - I mean it's

5316
02:14:20,530 --> 02:14:23,359
 

5317
02:14:20,540 --> 02:14:25,729
 more kind of maybe more closer to

5318
02:14:23,349 --> 02:14:25,729
 

5319
02:14:23,359 --> 02:14:27,320
 more close to a task-oriented dialogue

5320
02:14:25,719 --> 02:14:27,320
 

5321
02:14:25,729 --> 02:14:29,959
 and more restricted domain but it's

5322
02:14:27,310 --> 02:14:29,959
 

5323
02:14:27,320 --> 02:14:31,249
 perhaps more in terms of more reach in

5324
02:14:29,949 --> 02:14:31,249
 

5325
02:14:29,959 --> 02:14:33,349
 terms of content freelancer more

5326
02:14:31,239 --> 02:14:33,349
 

5327
02:14:31,249 --> 02:14:36,829
 recently a personal chat corpus which

5328
02:14:33,339 --> 02:14:36,829
 

5329
02:14:33,349 --> 02:14:39,349
 has been used in some competition also

5330
02:14:36,819 --> 02:14:39,349
 

5331
02:14:36,829 --> 02:14:41,859
 convey I too but it's much smaller

5332
02:14:39,339 --> 02:14:41,859
 

5333
02:14:39,349 --> 02:14:43,609
 because it's crowdsource but perhaps of

5334
02:14:41,849 --> 02:14:43,609
 

5335
02:14:41,859 --> 02:14:47,089
 better quality and it's also

5336
02:14:43,599 --> 02:14:47,089
 

5337
02:14:43,609 --> 02:14:49,639
 personalized data set so I'm going to

5338
02:14:47,079 --> 02:14:49,639
 

5339
02:14:47,089 --> 02:14:51,619
 talk about evaluation with evaluating

5340
02:14:49,629 --> 02:14:51,619
 

5341
02:14:49,639 --> 02:14:55,519
 the system so I mean before we talk

5342
02:14:51,609 --> 02:14:55,519
 

5343
02:14:51,619 --> 02:14:57,349
 about talk about benchmarks and

5344
02:14:55,509 --> 02:14:57,349
 

5345
02:14:55,519 --> 02:15:00,079
 competitions I mean Hardware valuator

5346
02:14:57,339 --> 02:15:00,079
 

5347
02:14:57,349 --> 02:15:01,519
 system and like in Jonathan's party was

5348
02:15:00,069 --> 02:15:01,519
 

5349
02:15:00,079 --> 02:15:03,439
 mortally mostly about task oriented

5350
02:15:01,509 --> 02:15:03,439
 

5351
02:15:01,519 --> 02:15:05,809
 dialogue so you can evaluate the system

5352
02:15:03,429 --> 02:15:05,809
 

5353
02:15:03,439 --> 02:15:08,269
 but asking is it actually a good

5354
02:15:05,799 --> 02:15:08,269
 

5355
02:15:05,809 --> 02:15:11,030
 response I mean did you did you actually

5356
02:15:08,259 --> 02:15:11,030
 

5357
02:15:08,269 --> 02:15:12,919
 solve did you address the problem of a

5358
02:15:11,020 --> 02:15:12,919
 

5359
02:15:11,030 --> 02:15:15,109
 user so you managed to book a flight or

5360
02:15:12,909 --> 02:15:15,109
 

5361
02:15:12,919 --> 02:15:16,809
 so on but it's more difficult to

5362
02:15:15,099 --> 02:15:16,809
 

5363
02:15:15,109 --> 02:15:19,879
 evaluating of complete open-ended

5364
02:15:16,799 --> 02:15:19,879
 

5365
02:15:16,809 --> 02:15:22,550
 setting where it's not even it's not

5366
02:15:19,869 --> 02:15:22,550
 

5367
02:15:19,879 --> 02:15:24,709
 even a clear task here so the way that

5368
02:15:22,540 --> 02:15:24,709
 

5369
02:15:22,550 --> 02:15:27,109
 people have been using for doing a human

5370
02:15:24,699 --> 02:15:27,109
 

5371
02:15:24,709 --> 02:15:29,059
 evolution is you give a response to were

5372
02:15:27,099 --> 02:15:29,059
 

5373
02:15:27,109 --> 02:15:30,619
 let's say a crowd worker and given the

5374
02:15:29,049 --> 02:15:30,619
 

5375
02:15:29,059 --> 02:15:33,079
 input or maybe convey certain context

5376
02:15:30,609 --> 02:15:33,079
 

5377
02:15:30,619 --> 02:15:35,570
 and ask the Turker was it a good

5378
02:15:33,069 --> 02:15:35,570
 

5379
02:15:33,079 --> 02:15:37,579
 response and good here's like I mean

5380
02:15:35,560 --> 02:15:37,579
 

5381
02:15:35,570 --> 02:15:39,609
 have different definitions whoever you

5382
02:15:37,569 --> 02:15:39,609
 

5383
02:15:37,579 --> 02:15:42,530
 want something relevant or interesting

5384
02:15:39,599 --> 02:15:42,530
 

5385
02:15:39,609 --> 02:15:44,300
 so I mean what can be done and people

5386
02:15:42,520 --> 02:15:44,300
 

5387
02:15:42,530 --> 02:15:45,739
 have used this a lot for human

5388
02:15:44,290 --> 02:15:45,739
 

5389
02:15:44,300 --> 02:15:47,899
 evaluation now the question can you do

5390
02:15:45,729 --> 02:15:47,899
 

5391
02:15:45,739 --> 02:15:50,599
 this automatically and people have

5392
02:15:47,889 --> 02:15:50,599
 

5393
02:15:47,899 --> 02:15:53,719
 borrowed metrics from machine transition

5394
02:15:50,589 --> 02:15:53,719
 

5395
02:15:50,599 --> 02:15:55,669
 again where where's this metric blue but

5396
02:15:53,709 --> 02:15:55,669
 

5397
02:15:53,719 --> 02:15:57,409
 but it's kind of relevant controversial

5398
02:15:55,659 --> 02:15:57,409
 

5399
02:15:55,669 --> 02:15:59,780
 in its use out sort of machine

5400
02:15:57,399 --> 02:15:59,780
 

5401
02:15:57,409 --> 02:16:01,280
 translation so the idea being that when

5402
02:15:59,770 --> 02:16:01,280
 

5403
02:15:59,780 --> 02:16:03,050
 you have a system response you're not

5404
02:16:01,270 --> 02:16:03,050
 

5405
02:16:01,280 --> 02:16:05,780
 going to evaluate its quality by

5406
02:16:03,040 --> 02:16:05,780
 

5407
02:16:03,050 --> 02:16:08,089
 matching engrams against references

5408
02:16:05,770 --> 02:16:08,089
 

5409
02:16:05,780 --> 02:16:10,879
 where ghosts on our human responses but

5410
02:16:08,079 --> 02:16:10,879
 

5411
02:16:08,089 --> 02:16:13,969
 you have well at least one of them but

5412
02:16:10,869 --> 02:16:13,969
 

5413
02:16:10,879 --> 02:16:16,039
 typically more than that and you do with

5414
02:16:13,959 --> 02:16:16,039
 

5415
02:16:13,969 --> 02:16:17,269
 lexical overlap I mean Engram overlap

5416
02:16:16,029 --> 02:16:17,269
 

5417
02:16:16,039 --> 02:16:18,949
 and it gives you a measure of that and

5418
02:16:17,259 --> 02:16:18,949
 

5419
02:16:17,269 --> 02:16:22,729
 there are various hobbies including NIST

5420
02:16:18,939 --> 02:16:22,729
 

5421
02:16:18,949 --> 02:16:26,599
 and meteor and variants are more kind of

5422
02:16:22,719 --> 02:16:26,599
 

5423
02:16:22,729 --> 02:16:28,489
 improvement of that but so is it true

5424
02:16:26,589 --> 02:16:28,489
 

5425
02:16:26,599 --> 02:16:30,649
 even a good metric so let's say you have

5426
02:16:28,479 --> 02:16:30,649
 

5427
02:16:28,489 --> 02:16:33,529
 an input like this and how are you and

5428
02:16:30,639 --> 02:16:33,529
 

5429
02:16:30,649 --> 02:16:36,409
 the responses I'm good thanks in a

5430
02:16:33,519 --> 02:16:36,409
 

5431
02:16:33,529 --> 02:16:37,190
 machine transition setting you'd well

5432
02:16:36,399 --> 02:16:37,190
 

5433
02:16:36,409 --> 02:16:38,929
 you'd have

5434
02:16:37,180 --> 02:16:38,929
 

5435
02:16:37,190 --> 02:16:41,030
 responses what kind of semantically

5436
02:16:38,919 --> 02:16:41,030
 

5437
02:16:38,929 --> 02:16:43,700
 equivalent so the other responds are

5438
02:16:41,020 --> 02:16:43,700
 

5439
02:16:41,030 --> 02:16:46,850
 good friends good like rose for our hair

5440
02:16:43,690 --> 02:16:46,850
 

5441
02:16:43,700 --> 02:16:48,380
 green but so what makes it is

5442
02:16:46,840 --> 02:16:48,380
 

5443
02:16:46,850 --> 02:16:51,440
 challenging for dialogue is about you're

5444
02:16:48,370 --> 02:16:51,440
 

5445
02:16:48,380 --> 02:16:53,840
 not only looking for responses that are

5446
02:16:51,430 --> 02:16:53,840
 

5447
02:16:51,440 --> 02:16:57,230
 semantically equivalent because there

5448
02:16:53,830 --> 02:16:57,230
 

5449
02:16:53,840 --> 02:16:59,360
 might be many different response about

5450
02:16:57,220 --> 02:16:59,360
 

5451
02:16:57,230 --> 02:17:00,650
 have a different meaning that actually

5452
02:16:59,350 --> 02:17:00,650
 

5453
02:16:59,360 --> 02:17:03,110
 appropriate for your input so how you

5454
02:17:00,640 --> 02:17:03,110
 

5455
02:17:00,650 --> 02:17:04,580
 actually response might be on board but

5456
02:17:03,100 --> 02:17:04,580
 

5457
02:17:03,110 --> 02:17:07,130
 it's still a good response so I think

5458
02:17:04,570 --> 02:17:07,130
 

5459
02:17:04,580 --> 02:17:09,020
 that the challenge here is to say if

5460
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:09,020
 

5461
02:17:07,130 --> 02:17:11,480
 you're gonna do have a reference based

5462
02:17:09,010 --> 02:17:11,480
 

5463
02:17:09,020 --> 02:17:12,890
 evaluation metric the space of possible

5464
02:17:11,470 --> 02:17:12,890
 

5465
02:17:11,480 --> 02:17:15,290
 responds much wider so that means

5466
02:17:12,880 --> 02:17:15,290
 

5467
02:17:12,890 --> 02:17:17,270
 perhaps you need many more references so

5468
02:17:15,280 --> 02:17:17,270
 

5469
02:17:15,290 --> 02:17:18,890
 what people have found I mean a few

5470
02:17:17,260 --> 02:17:18,890
 

5471
02:17:17,270 --> 02:17:20,780
 years ago is that well if you use a

5472
02:17:18,880 --> 02:17:20,780
 

5473
02:17:18,890 --> 02:17:22,670
 metric like blue or some relative

5474
02:17:20,770 --> 02:17:22,670
 

5475
02:17:20,780 --> 02:17:24,980
 metrics and evaluate ways compared to

5476
02:17:22,660 --> 02:17:24,980
 

5477
02:17:22,670 --> 02:17:26,719
 human score it's really all over the

5478
02:17:24,970 --> 02:17:26,719
 

5479
02:17:24,980 --> 02:17:29,900
 place but don't recall it very well and

5480
02:17:26,709 --> 02:17:29,900
 

5481
02:17:26,719 --> 02:17:32,300
 but what's at the sentence level and

5482
02:17:29,890 --> 02:17:32,300
 

5483
02:17:29,900 --> 02:17:34,580
 perhaps is not too surprising because if

5484
02:17:32,290 --> 02:17:34,580
 

5485
02:17:32,300 --> 02:17:36,230
 you do this you have the same do the

5486
02:17:34,570 --> 02:17:36,230
 

5487
02:17:34,580 --> 02:17:38,600
 same for over time machine translation

5488
02:17:36,220 --> 02:17:38,600
 

5489
02:17:36,230 --> 02:17:40,010
 it's really hard so blue and other

5490
02:17:38,590 --> 02:17:40,010
 

5491
02:17:38,600 --> 02:17:42,110
 metrics have been highly criticized

5492
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,110
 

5493
02:17:40,010 --> 02:17:44,300
 because this lack of correlation but but

5494
02:17:42,100 --> 02:17:44,300
 

5495
02:17:42,110 --> 02:17:47,300
 we think it's mostly an artifact of the

5496
02:17:44,290 --> 02:17:47,300
 

5497
02:17:44,300 --> 02:17:49,820
 fact that we evaluating this at the

5498
02:17:47,290 --> 02:17:49,820
 

5499
02:17:47,300 --> 02:17:51,380
 Centers of all but these metrics

5500
02:17:49,810 --> 02:17:51,380
 

5501
02:17:49,820 --> 02:17:54,490
 actually initially were not designed for

5502
02:17:51,370 --> 02:17:54,490
 

5503
02:17:51,380 --> 02:17:57,860
 central several correlation so I mean

5504
02:17:54,480 --> 02:17:57,860
 

5505
02:17:54,490 --> 02:18:00,170
 you blue for example was a corporate

5506
02:17:57,850 --> 02:18:00,170
 

5507
02:17:57,860 --> 02:18:03,560
 level metrics so basically you try to

5508
02:18:00,160 --> 02:18:03,560
 

5509
02:18:00,170 --> 02:18:05,900
 have a data point connecting the

5510
02:18:03,550 --> 02:18:05,900
 

5511
02:18:03,560 --> 02:18:08,300
 performance of a system on an entire

5512
02:18:05,890 --> 02:18:08,300
 

5513
02:18:05,900 --> 02:18:10,190
 test set I mean compare of a blue score

5514
02:18:08,290 --> 02:18:10,190
 

5515
02:18:08,300 --> 02:18:12,800
 of a human's go on this entire test set

5516
02:18:10,180 --> 02:18:12,800
 

5517
02:18:10,190 --> 02:18:15,320
 and if you do this I mean you really

5518
02:18:12,790 --> 02:18:15,320
 

5519
02:18:12,800 --> 02:18:17,240
 have to do this because it's if if you

5520
02:18:15,310 --> 02:18:17,240
 

5521
02:18:15,320 --> 02:18:19,219
 have less a testifies small of a six

5522
02:18:17,230 --> 02:18:19,219
 

5523
02:18:17,240 --> 02:18:24,380
 hundred example it's not even blue is

5524
02:18:19,209 --> 02:18:24,380
 

5525
02:18:19,219 --> 02:18:26,330
 not even reliable on a task much easier

5526
02:18:24,370 --> 02:18:26,330
 

5527
02:18:24,380 --> 02:18:27,890
 like machine translation so and there's

5528
02:18:26,320 --> 02:18:27,890
 

5529
02:18:26,330 --> 02:18:29,900
 also a bit of a central limit theorem

5530
02:18:27,880 --> 02:18:29,900
 

5531
02:18:27,890 --> 02:18:31,820
 argument here I mean if you use the

5532
02:18:29,890 --> 02:18:31,820
 

5533
02:18:29,900 --> 02:18:33,800
 varies if you look at correlation and

5534
02:18:31,810 --> 02:18:33,800
 

5535
02:18:31,820 --> 02:18:35,690
 very small test set like just a statins

5536
02:18:33,790 --> 02:18:35,690
 

5537
02:18:33,800 --> 02:18:38,270
 level of course gonna get a lot of

5538
02:18:35,680 --> 02:18:38,270
 

5539
02:18:35,690 --> 02:18:40,219
 variation but if you want to have better

5540
02:18:38,260 --> 02:18:40,219
 

5541
02:18:38,270 --> 02:18:42,800
 correlation and you should move towards

5542
02:18:40,209 --> 02:18:42,800
 

5543
02:18:40,219 --> 02:18:45,410
 a more corporate level blow where let's

5544
02:18:42,790 --> 02:18:45,410
 

5545
02:18:42,800 --> 02:18:47,780
 say you get to maybe 50 samples and you

5546
02:18:45,400 --> 02:18:47,780
 

5547
02:18:45,410 --> 02:18:49,800
 see much more correlation you'll have a

5548
02:18:47,770 --> 02:18:49,800
 

5549
02:18:47,780 --> 02:18:51,450
 Pearson correlation coefficient

5550
02:18:49,790 --> 02:18:51,450
 

5551
02:18:49,800 --> 02:18:55,290
 climbing up because you're moving

5552
02:18:51,440 --> 02:18:55,290
 

5553
02:18:51,450 --> 02:18:57,450
 towards a corporate level metric so so

5554
02:18:55,280 --> 02:18:57,450
 

5555
02:18:55,290 --> 02:18:59,250
 what people have found is like when you

5556
02:18:57,440 --> 02:18:59,250
 

5557
02:18:57,450 --> 02:19:01,050
 move from sentence level evaluation to

5558
02:18:59,240 --> 02:19:01,050
 

5559
02:18:59,250 --> 02:19:03,240
 corpus level so if you measure

5560
02:19:01,040 --> 02:19:03,240
 

5561
02:19:01,050 --> 02:19:04,710
 correlation and fairly big test that you

5562
02:19:03,230 --> 02:19:04,710
 

5563
02:19:03,240 --> 02:19:07,019
 actually get very high correlation

5564
02:19:04,700 --> 02:19:07,019
 

5565
02:19:04,710 --> 02:19:08,969
 results for my ship transition now but

5566
02:19:07,009 --> 02:19:08,969
 

5567
02:19:07,019 --> 02:19:12,120
 now the open question here which hasn't

5568
02:19:08,959 --> 02:19:12,120
 

5569
02:19:08,969 --> 02:19:13,649
 been really studied for dialog when you

5570
02:19:12,110 --> 02:19:13,649
 

5571
02:19:12,120 --> 02:19:15,809
 had corpus level what kind of collection

5572
02:19:13,639 --> 02:19:15,809
 

5573
02:19:13,649 --> 02:19:18,059
 do you see and we I mean our group we've

5574
02:19:15,799 --> 02:19:18,059
 

5575
02:19:15,809 --> 02:19:20,010
 done a little bit of work on bad space I

5576
02:19:18,049 --> 02:19:20,010
 

5577
02:19:18,059 --> 02:19:21,179
 mean it's a notation for visa very

5578
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:21,179
 

5579
02:19:20,010 --> 02:19:23,399
 expensive because if you do corporate

5580
02:19:21,169 --> 02:19:23,399
 

5581
02:19:21,179 --> 02:19:25,139
 level domain means you need to get a lot

5582
02:19:23,389 --> 02:19:25,139
 

5583
02:19:23,399 --> 02:19:27,149
 of human judgment for just having one

5584
02:19:25,129 --> 02:19:27,149
 

5585
02:19:25,139 --> 02:19:28,469
 data point so you can imagine if you

5586
02:19:27,139 --> 02:19:28,469
 

5587
02:19:27,149 --> 02:19:31,290
 want like four zones of data point to

5588
02:19:28,459 --> 02:19:31,290
 

5589
02:19:28,469 --> 02:19:34,250
 create kind of to have some be able to

5590
02:19:31,280 --> 02:19:34,250
 

5591
02:19:31,290 --> 02:19:38,280
 measure some correlation on on let's say

5592
02:19:34,240 --> 02:19:38,280
 

5593
02:19:34,250 --> 02:19:40,800
 a sample surface is big enough it's hard

5594
02:19:38,270 --> 02:19:40,800
 

5595
02:19:38,280 --> 02:19:45,000
 to see but we did a little bit of that

5596
02:19:40,790 --> 02:19:45,000
 

5597
02:19:40,800 --> 02:19:47,819
 and do so but actually well if some

5598
02:19:44,990 --> 02:19:47,819
 

5599
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:49,620
 sample size number one so if you look at

5600
02:19:47,809 --> 02:19:49,620
 

5601
02:19:47,819 --> 02:19:51,780
 the Centers of a correlation correlation

5602
02:19:49,610 --> 02:19:51,780
 

5603
02:19:49,620 --> 02:19:55,200
 is pretty much in existence but you go

5604
02:19:51,770 --> 02:19:55,200
 

5605
02:19:51,780 --> 02:19:56,640
 to document or corpuses two of let's say

5606
02:19:55,190 --> 02:19:56,640
 

5607
02:19:55,200 --> 02:20:00,899
 up to 100 you get to much higher

5608
02:19:56,630 --> 02:20:00,899
 

5609
02:19:56,640 --> 02:20:02,580
 correlation okay and so but that's kind

5610
02:20:00,889 --> 02:20:02,580
 

5611
02:20:00,899 --> 02:20:04,979
 of the takeaway from in terms of

5612
02:20:02,570 --> 02:20:04,979
 

5613
02:20:02,580 --> 02:20:07,290
 automatic metric is kind of the Machine

5614
02:20:04,969 --> 02:20:07,290
 

5615
02:20:04,979 --> 02:20:08,819
 air evaluation machine translation based

5616
02:20:07,280 --> 02:20:08,819
 

5617
02:20:07,290 --> 02:20:11,399
 evaluation metrics are perhaps not so

5618
02:20:08,809 --> 02:20:11,399
 

5619
02:20:08,819 --> 02:20:13,080
 good it's still unclear where it goes

5620
02:20:11,389 --> 02:20:13,080
 

5621
02:20:11,399 --> 02:20:15,720
 but there have been more recent work on

5622
02:20:13,070 --> 02:20:15,720
 

5623
02:20:13,080 --> 02:20:19,470
 maybe more trainable metrics where the

5624
02:20:15,710 --> 02:20:19,470
 

5625
02:20:15,720 --> 02:20:21,000
 input is basically you given a context

5626
02:20:19,460 --> 02:20:21,000
 

5627
02:20:19,470 --> 02:20:24,840
 which is maybe the conversation history

5628
02:20:20,990 --> 02:20:24,840
 

5629
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:27,720
 the response of this the goals on are

5630
02:20:24,830 --> 02:20:27,720
 

5631
02:20:24,840 --> 02:20:32,399
 responsible responsible system and you

5632
02:20:27,710 --> 02:20:32,399
 

5633
02:20:27,720 --> 02:20:37,109
 use maybe a VA trade model - yeah we're

5634
02:20:32,389 --> 02:20:37,109
 

5635
02:20:32,399 --> 02:20:39,930
 wrapping up - to get you a score between

5636
02:20:37,099 --> 02:20:39,930
 

5637
02:20:37,109 --> 02:20:41,850
 1 and 5 of assessing the quality of the

5638
02:20:39,920 --> 02:20:41,850
 

5639
02:20:39,930 --> 02:20:44,930
 system response based again on the gold

5640
02:20:41,840 --> 02:20:44,930
 

5641
02:20:41,850 --> 02:20:47,700
 standard and the input and they show but

5642
02:20:44,920 --> 02:20:47,700
 

5643
02:20:44,930 --> 02:20:49,979
 it's actually whereas at the sentence

5644
02:20:47,690 --> 02:20:49,979
 

5645
02:20:47,700 --> 02:20:53,399
 level you get a certain inoculation get

5646
02:20:49,969 --> 02:20:53,399
 

5647
02:20:49,979 --> 02:20:56,340
 better correlation with but metric the

5648
02:20:53,389 --> 02:20:56,340
 

5649
02:20:53,399 --> 02:20:57,689
 trainable metric but yeah now the

5650
02:20:56,330 --> 02:20:57,689
 

5651
02:20:56,340 --> 02:20:59,141
 challenge is because it's a trainable

5652
02:20:57,679 --> 02:20:59,141
 

5653
02:20:57,689 --> 02:21:01,990
 metric how do general

5654
02:20:59,131 --> 02:21:01,990
 

5655
02:20:59,141 --> 02:21:05,650
 held out set and it just it's may be

5656
02:21:01,980 --> 02:21:05,650
 

5657
02:21:01,990 --> 02:21:09,311
 prone to everything so it's always more

5658
02:21:05,640 --> 02:21:09,311
 

5659
02:21:05,650 --> 02:21:10,540
 I figure should kind of wrap up soon in

5660
02:21:09,301 --> 02:21:10,540
 

5661
02:21:09,311 --> 02:21:12,820
 the slides I mean if interest you can

5662
02:21:10,530 --> 02:21:12,820
 

5663
02:21:10,540 --> 02:21:14,980
 get access to a slide it's more about

5664
02:21:12,810 --> 02:21:14,980
 

5665
02:21:12,820 --> 02:21:18,070
 commercial systems and if you want to

5666
02:21:14,970 --> 02:21:18,070
 

5667
02:21:14,980 --> 02:21:21,700
 actually build your own system based on

5668
02:21:18,060 --> 02:21:21,700
 

5669
02:21:18,070 --> 02:21:23,021
 but as as scientists and researcher

5670
02:21:21,690 --> 02:21:23,021
 

5671
02:21:21,700 --> 02:21:25,181
 maybe you might be more interested but

5672
02:21:23,011 --> 02:21:25,181
 

5673
02:21:23,021 --> 02:21:27,490
 open benchmarks over free I would say

5674
02:21:25,171 --> 02:21:27,490
 

5675
02:21:25,181 --> 02:21:30,851
 free main open benchmarks on actually

5676
02:21:27,480 --> 02:21:30,851
 

5677
02:21:27,490 --> 02:21:32,710
 evaluating these systems and surveys by

5678
02:21:30,841 --> 02:21:32,710
 

5679
02:21:30,851 --> 02:21:35,021
 Alex such honors I'm sure many of you

5680
02:21:32,700 --> 02:21:35,021
 

5681
02:21:32,710 --> 02:21:39,880
 have heard that has been going on for

5682
02:21:35,011 --> 02:21:39,880
 

5683
02:21:35,021 --> 02:21:41,740
 its 2017 as DST see but Jennifer

5684
02:21:39,870 --> 02:21:41,740
 

5685
02:21:39,880 --> 02:21:43,780
 mentioned earlier which used to stand

5686
02:21:41,730 --> 02:21:43,780
 

5687
02:21:41,740 --> 02:21:45,790
 for Dalek state tracking challenge which

5688
02:21:43,770 --> 02:21:45,790
 

5689
02:21:43,780 --> 02:21:48,130
 was more about task oriented dialogue it

5690
02:21:45,780 --> 02:21:48,130
 

5691
02:21:45,790 --> 02:21:50,141
 switched more recently towards evolution

5692
02:21:48,120 --> 02:21:50,141
 

5693
02:21:48,130 --> 02:21:52,870
 with one more end-to-end and enquiries

5694
02:21:50,131 --> 02:21:52,870
 

5695
02:21:50,141 --> 02:21:55,750
 like participation of tracks where you

5696
02:21:52,860 --> 02:21:55,750
 

5697
02:21:52,870 --> 02:21:57,790
 you actually providing system but our

5698
02:21:55,740 --> 02:21:57,790
 

5699
02:21:55,750 --> 02:21:59,410
 end to end and being evaluated in the

5700
02:21:57,780 --> 02:21:59,410
 

5701
02:21:57,790 --> 02:22:01,721
 context of web this evolution of the

5702
02:21:59,400 --> 02:22:01,721
 

5703
02:21:59,410 --> 02:22:05,311
 last evolution which was in February

5704
02:22:01,711 --> 02:22:05,311
 

5705
02:22:01,721 --> 02:22:07,630
 January this year was how to focus on

5706
02:22:05,301 --> 02:22:07,630
 

5707
02:22:05,311 --> 02:22:10,811
 grounding which I mentioned earlier and

5708
02:22:07,620 --> 02:22:10,811
 

5709
02:22:07,630 --> 02:22:13,061
 it's kind of getting really big and the

5710
02:22:10,801 --> 02:22:13,061
 

5711
02:22:10,811 --> 02:22:17,230
 third one which is also very popular

5712
02:22:13,051 --> 02:22:17,230
 

5713
02:22:13,061 --> 02:22:20,500
 it's a confit I that has convey I one

5714
02:22:17,220 --> 02:22:20,500
 

5715
02:22:17,230 --> 02:22:23,410
 and two and there might be maybe at some

5716
02:22:20,490 --> 02:22:23,410
 

5717
02:22:20,500 --> 02:22:25,780
 later here comes a free and I encourage

5718
02:22:23,400 --> 02:22:25,780
 

5719
02:22:23,410 --> 02:22:30,280
 you to follow and to keep tuned on these

5720
02:22:25,770 --> 02:22:30,280
 

5721
02:22:25,780 --> 02:22:32,351
 next competitions and yeah so I mean I'm

5722
02:22:30,270 --> 02:22:32,351
 

5723
02:22:30,280 --> 02:22:34,900
 gonna wrap up so basically end to end

5724
02:22:32,341 --> 02:22:34,900
 

5725
02:22:32,351 --> 02:22:37,540
 dialogue so what we can I think the

5726
02:22:34,890 --> 02:22:37,540
 

5727
02:22:34,900 --> 02:22:38,980
 takeaway message he is but this the

5728
02:22:37,530 --> 02:22:38,980
 

5729
02:22:37,540 --> 02:22:40,990
 system's a pretty good at kind of

5730
02:22:38,970 --> 02:22:40,990
 

5731
02:22:38,980 --> 02:22:43,780
 generative effluent kind of plausible

5732
02:22:40,980 --> 02:22:43,780
 

5733
02:22:40,990 --> 02:22:45,130
 response in a way you it captured the

5734
02:22:43,770 --> 02:22:45,130
 

5735
02:22:43,780 --> 02:22:47,080
 kind of backbone on the shell of

5736
02:22:45,120 --> 02:22:47,080
 

5737
02:22:45,130 --> 02:22:51,311
 conversation the problem is more to

5738
02:22:47,070 --> 02:22:51,311
 

5739
02:22:47,080 --> 02:22:53,440
 insert content words in words responses

5740
02:22:51,301 --> 02:22:53,440
 

5741
02:22:51,311 --> 02:22:55,181
 and and there's no magic here because

5742
02:22:53,430 --> 02:22:55,181
 

5743
02:22:53,440 --> 02:22:56,681
 it's kind of if you don't have any

5744
02:22:55,171 --> 02:22:56,681
 

5745
02:22:55,181 --> 02:22:58,780
 grounding is really hard for the system

5746
02:22:56,671 --> 02:22:58,780
 

5747
02:22:56,681 --> 02:23:01,570
 to generate a good response so the key

5748
02:22:58,770 --> 02:23:01,570
 

5749
02:22:58,780 --> 02:23:03,700
 part is really to have the ability for a

5750
02:23:01,560 --> 02:23:03,700
 

5751
02:23:01,570 --> 02:23:07,990
 system to have external grounding and

5752
02:23:03,690 --> 02:23:07,990
 

5753
02:23:03,700 --> 02:23:10,091
 the ability to to you know integrate

5754
02:23:07,980 --> 02:23:10,091
 

5755
02:23:07,990 --> 02:23:11,070
 knowledge from that's a external

5756
02:23:10,081 --> 02:23:11,070
 

5757
02:23:10,091 --> 02:23:13,681
 document and

5758
02:23:11,060 --> 02:23:13,681
 

5759
02:23:11,070 --> 02:23:15,450
 help that to generate better response so

5760
02:23:13,671 --> 02:23:15,450
 

5761
02:23:13,681 --> 02:23:17,521
 that's one of the key challenge for the

5762
02:23:15,440 --> 02:23:17,521
 

5763
02:23:15,450 --> 02:23:19,261
 future I think it's a disability to the

5764
02:23:17,511 --> 02:23:19,261
 

5765
02:23:17,521 --> 02:23:21,061
 ground not only like a non freeform text

5766
02:23:19,251 --> 02:23:21,061
 

5767
02:23:19,261 --> 02:23:24,030
 what have been done before maybe but

5768
02:23:21,051 --> 02:23:24,030
 

5769
02:23:21,061 --> 02:23:25,830
 maybe the bigger challenge is gable to

5770
02:23:24,020 --> 02:23:25,830
 

5771
02:23:24,030 --> 02:23:28,261
 exploit API and the strengthen was

5772
02:23:25,820 --> 02:23:28,261
 

5773
02:23:25,830 --> 02:23:30,000
 saying the challenging bark is it's it's

5774
02:23:28,251 --> 02:23:30,000
 

5775
02:23:28,261 --> 02:23:32,990
 not continuously differentiable because

5776
02:23:29,990 --> 02:23:32,990
 

5777
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:37,021
 what you get from the API is basically

5778
02:23:32,980 --> 02:23:37,021
 

5779
02:23:32,990 --> 02:23:39,271
 its symbolic so it's it's tricky to to

5780
02:23:37,011 --> 02:23:39,271
 

5781
02:23:37,021 --> 02:23:43,380
 differentiate so maybe my last slide

5782
02:23:39,261 --> 02:23:43,380
 

5783
02:23:39,271 --> 02:23:45,360
 here so most of what i've been i've been

5784
02:23:43,370 --> 02:23:45,360
 

5785
02:23:43,380 --> 02:23:49,230
 talking in my part was basically end to

5786
02:23:45,350 --> 02:23:49,230
 

5787
02:23:45,360 --> 02:23:51,511
 end systems and chatbots and it was on

5788
02:23:49,220 --> 02:23:51,511
 

5789
02:23:49,230 --> 02:23:53,280
 the spectrum it's more about being

5790
02:23:51,501 --> 02:23:53,280
 

5791
02:23:51,511 --> 02:23:55,920
 completely end to end but perhaps not

5792
02:23:53,270 --> 02:23:55,920
 

5793
02:23:53,280 --> 02:23:59,910
 yet doing something useful very useful I

5794
02:23:55,910 --> 02:23:59,910
 

5795
02:23:55,920 --> 02:24:01,141
 mean so to speak very but on the other

5796
02:23:59,900 --> 02:24:01,141
 

5797
02:23:59,910 --> 02:24:02,971
 hand you have more traditional task

5798
02:24:01,131 --> 02:24:02,971
 

5799
02:24:01,141 --> 02:24:05,040
 oriented bars for I'm not kind of fully

5800
02:24:02,961 --> 02:24:05,040
 

5801
02:24:02,971 --> 02:24:07,080
 end-to-end I mean some of it is end to

5802
02:24:05,030 --> 02:24:07,080
 

5803
02:24:05,040 --> 02:24:09,570
 end but more and we're kind of practical

5804
02:24:07,070 --> 02:24:09,570
 

5805
02:24:07,080 --> 02:24:11,250
 and and it seems for like both

5806
02:24:09,560 --> 02:24:11,250
 

5807
02:24:09,570 --> 02:24:13,230
 communities I mean people work in both

5808
02:24:11,240 --> 02:24:13,230
 

5809
02:24:11,250 --> 02:24:15,480
 tasks start the dialogue more converging

5810
02:24:13,220 --> 02:24:15,480
 

5811
02:24:13,230 --> 02:24:16,891
 to a point where I mean first here's the

5812
02:24:15,470 --> 02:24:16,891
 

5813
02:24:15,480 --> 02:24:18,240
 grounding part makes it more useful

5814
02:24:16,881 --> 02:24:18,240
 

5815
02:24:16,891 --> 02:24:19,891
 because you integrate information in the

5816
02:24:18,230 --> 02:24:19,891
 

5817
02:24:18,240 --> 02:24:21,660
 system but there would be a point I mean

5818
02:24:19,881 --> 02:24:21,660
 

5819
02:24:19,891 --> 02:24:23,971
 to me is more like the holy grail trying

5820
02:24:21,650 --> 02:24:23,971
 

5821
02:24:21,660 --> 02:24:26,370
 to get to a point where we can have

5822
02:24:23,961 --> 02:24:26,370
 

5823
02:24:23,971 --> 02:24:28,170
 maybe a free entrance is somebody's

5824
02:24:26,360 --> 02:24:28,170
 

5825
02:24:26,370 --> 02:24:30,061
 morgue address the task oriented

5826
02:24:28,160 --> 02:24:30,061
 

5827
02:24:28,170 --> 02:24:32,940
 dialogue okay I'm going to skip voice

5828
02:24:30,051 --> 02:24:32,940
 

5829
02:24:30,061 --> 02:24:35,160
 part but um so I just want to say that

5830
02:24:32,930 --> 02:24:35,160
 

5831
02:24:32,940 --> 02:24:37,801
 if you have I mean we'll be happy to the

5832
02:24:35,150 --> 02:24:37,801
 

5833
02:24:35,160 --> 02:24:40,080
 questions now but if later you want to

5834
02:24:37,791 --> 02:24:40,080
 

5835
02:24:37,801 --> 02:24:42,090
 contact us have question about this with

5836
02:24:40,070 --> 02:24:42,090
 

5837
02:24:40,080 --> 02:24:45,061
 your contact information all the slides

5838
02:24:42,080 --> 02:24:45,061
 

5839
02:24:42,090 --> 02:24:48,360
 here you can find them on the conference

5840
02:24:45,051 --> 02:24:48,360
 

5841
02:24:45,061 --> 02:24:50,101
 schedule and it has so you could see

5842
02:24:48,350 --> 02:24:50,101
 

5843
02:24:48,360 --> 02:24:53,190
 many citations where you can just follow

5844
02:24:50,091 --> 02:24:53,190
 

5845
02:24:50,101 --> 02:24:55,440
 the hyperlink and connect linked it has

5846
02:24:53,180 --> 02:24:55,440
 

5847
02:24:53,190 --> 02:24:56,940
 linked to PDFs and again a strengthens

5848
02:24:55,430 --> 02:24:56,940
 

5849
02:24:55,440 --> 02:24:59,280
 that at the beginning but to version of

5850
02:24:56,930 --> 02:24:59,280
 

5851
02:24:56,940 --> 02:25:01,410
 this there's a journal paper version of

5852
02:24:59,270 --> 02:25:01,410
 

5853
02:24:59,280 --> 02:25:02,940
 each tutorial one that is published was

5854
02:25:01,400 --> 02:25:02,940
 

5855
02:25:01,410 --> 02:25:05,940
 a published as a journal paper but

5856
02:25:02,930 --> 02:25:05,940
 

5857
02:25:02,940 --> 02:25:07,830
 appropriate like a promotion of that

5858
02:25:05,930 --> 02:25:07,830
 

5859
02:25:05,940 --> 02:25:09,931
 paper is available for free you can find

5860
02:25:07,820 --> 02:25:09,931
 

5861
02:25:07,830 --> 02:25:12,960
 it on archive and I can turn it from is

5862
02:25:09,921 --> 02:25:12,960
 

5863
02:25:09,931 --> 02:25:15,290
 a QR code and yeah so I'm happy to

5864
02:25:12,950 --> 02:25:15,290
 

5865
02:25:12,960 --> 02:25:15,290
 answer questions

5866
02:25:19,870 --> 02:25:19,870
 

5867
02:25:19,880 --> 02:25:23,819
 so yeah I guess it's not a progression

5868
02:25:23,360 --> 02:25:23,819
 

5869
02:25:23,370 --> 02:25:27,960
 sir

5870
02:25:23,809 --> 02:25:27,960
 

5871
02:25:23,819 --> 02:25:29,819
 I saw better you can just buy yeah so

5872
02:25:27,950 --> 02:25:29,819
 

5873
02:25:27,960 --> 02:25:31,920
 this tutorial has formally ended but the

5874
02:25:29,809 --> 02:25:31,920
 

5875
02:25:29,819 --> 02:25:35,670
 speakers will stay around here to answer

5876
02:25:31,910 --> 02:25:35,670
 

5877
02:25:31,920 --> 02:25:37,970
 any of your questions so yeah thanks a

5878
02:25:35,660 --> 02:25:37,970
 

5879
02:25:35,670 --> 02:25:37,970
 lot again
