00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,620
GARY GENSLER: So welcome back.

5
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:19,880
We're going to keep this
journey going on FinTech.

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,480
We spoke about payments
in our last class.

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:30,320
And here in Class 7, we're
going to dive into credit,

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,310
and there's a lot to cover.

9
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,910
There are so many different
segments and sectors

10
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,940
in the credit space, and
there's a lot going on

11
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,280
with financial technology,
not just because

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,720
of artificial intelligence,
Open API, but even

13
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,510
the earlier things that
were brought into the tech.

14
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:52,730
Now, technology stack around
mobile phones and the like

15
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:56,810
still gives a lot of
opportunity to break in here,

16
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:00,660
and the use of alternative data.

17
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,790
So I'm going to bring up--

18
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:09,260
share some slides
and get going here.

19
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,890
First, I should
also say to those

20
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:25,100
who celebrate such things,
happy Earth Day, April 22.

21
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,350
It's also my daughter's
birthday, my eldest,

22
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:30,140
my first daughter at 3.

23
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:34,580
So today's a special day, Earth
Day and my daughter's birthday.

24
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,320
So happy birthday, Anna.

25
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,780
So I'm going to do a
little update on Facebook.

26
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:49,520
We spoke about Facebook in
our last class about payments.

27
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,950
And there were interesting
announcements, actually,

28
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,740
as we were together.

29
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,350
Facebook was announcing
some updates.

30
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,740
And then dive into
the credit world.

31
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,210
And before we dive
into FinTech, just

32
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:05,120
talk a little bit about
those credit sectors

33
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,830
and the market designing credit.

34
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,650
And that provides,
as we'll see, some

35
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:13,520
of the disruptive potential
and how disruptive Taq

36
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,440
can break into the
credit value chain.

37
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,470
What you're always
looking for in a business,

38
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,260
whether it's about
FinTech or otherwise,

39
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,100
is somehow to break into
another party's value chain

40
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,280
or to create value
for customers.

41
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,370
Either you can create value
where others haven't seen it,

42
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,990
or you want to break into
somebody else's value chain.

43
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,840
So we'll talk a
little bit about that,

44
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,610
how we see that pretty
early in this area

45
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,100
of financial technology.

46
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,220
And then a review of the
competitive landscape

47
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,776
by the different marketplaces.

48
00:02:49,776 --> 00:02:55,280
I'll touch on marketplace
lending and credit scoring,

49
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,310
and then I'll close with just
a comment on professionalism

50
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,040
and academic
integrity, as people

51
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,240
are gearing up for their papers
and group work, and so forth,

52
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,740
again.

53
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:10,040
The readings included a review
of 12 FinTech companies.

54
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,480
This was just a taste test.

55
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,850
It was one article in
reaction to Apple Credit Card.

56
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,450
And these were FinTech companies
in the credit card space.

57
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,130
But as we'll see
today, we're going

58
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:24,590
to review a lot of the
other spaces, as well.

59
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,320
A brief article
that I thought was

60
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,420
helpful about how
tech companies are

61
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:32,930
seeing how to get into the
lending business, big tech,

62
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,100
particularly.

63
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,920
Marketplace lenders,
we'll look at Lending Club

64
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,360
more particularly, and
then alternative data.

65
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,910
Study questions, again,
are not just for you

66
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:47,340
to gear up and
prepare for the class,

67
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,570
but this is where I
want to sort of end how

68
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:54,620
we can think about this, really
importantly, how big tech

69
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,630
firms are positioning
themselves to offer credit.

70
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,180
And I don't know,
Romain, if anybody

71
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:03,300
is going to sort of get
the cobwebs off and give us

72
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,407
some thoughts, but
I'm going to turn

73
00:04:05,407 --> 00:04:07,990
it to Romain to see if there's
anybody that wants to just give

74
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:11,350
it a thought, broad overview
of big tech in this space,

75
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:16,600
whether it's from China,
Europe, the US, Latin America.

76
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,880
OK, let's go for today's class.

77
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,910
Who would like to be
the first volunteer?

78
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:23,790
Michael.

79
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,290
Thank you.

80
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,290
AUDIENCE: I guess
something from the article

81
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:34,050
that [INAUDIBLE] just kind of
seeing over the last decade,

82
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:38,100
what's going on, there's
been a lot more availability

83
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:38,820
of lending.

84
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,082
I think Lending Club was--

85
00:04:41,082 --> 00:04:44,150
I kind of saw it more
from a personal investing

86
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,580
point of view, but kind of
thinking of who can actually

87
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:50,080
have access to credit has
been a huge position of tech

88
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:56,450
in the US, and also the speed
of the traditional credit

89
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,490
process for consumers
and small businesses

90
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,830
has been kind of painful.

91
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:04,230
So that's definitely a
big area that big tech

92
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:10,155
is trying to tackle with AI
and just automated processes.

93
00:05:10,155 --> 00:05:11,280
GARY GENSLER: Right, right.

94
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,470
But Michael, if you add to it,
think about big tech companies.

95
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:18,770
How are big tech companies
strategically positioning

96
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:19,630
themselves?

97
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,010
I mean, Lending Club and
the marketplace lenders

98
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:27,000
are a very important
trend here, as well,

99
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
these sort of more
disruptive companies,

100
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,890
some of them becoming
incumbents in their space.

101
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,360
But how about big platforms?

102
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,580
I guess embedding it with their
current services, products

103
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,570
that they already have.

104
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:39,920
Like, Apple Pay
was a good example,

105
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,420
where it's just
kind of everybody's

106
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,180
already using an iPhone, so if
they can just make it seamless

107
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,490
with their existing processes.

108
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,470
So this is again
[INAUDIBLE]---- well,

109
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,720
I see a couple other hands up.

110
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,420
So, Romain?

111
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,975
TA: Alessandro?

112
00:05:54,975 --> 00:05:55,600
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

113
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,710
I think, also, Amazon is a
very interesting case where,

114
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,350
thanks to all the data, they
have gathered on sellers

115
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,560
from their marketplace,
they are able to offer

116
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,590
short-term lending to all the
sellers on the marketplace.

117
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:14,570
And this also gives them
a competitive advantage.

118
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,760
These would be banks,
commercial banks, first of all.

119
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,700
Because the notion of this
lending is very small.

120
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,020
So it's comparable
to microlending.

121
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,910
And second, because
they have access

122
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:32,950
to a huge amount of data on
the business of these sellers.

123
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:37,650
And third, they have a
direct accessed repayment.

124
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,140
Because basically,
these repayments

125
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:44,810
are automatic from the business
of the sellers on the Amazon

126
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,367
Marketplace.

127
00:06:46,367 --> 00:06:47,200
GARY GENSLER: Right.

128
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:54,580
So what Michael and
Alexandro have said is--

129
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,320
well, first, we talked a little
bit about the disruptors.

130
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,960
But in terms of
big tech, they have

131
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,110
a lot of network advantages,
whether it's Apple.

132
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,610
And there's so many
people that have

133
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,070
their phones and their
products, whether it's

134
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,780
Amazon in the case that--

135
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,030
Alexandro, we can go to
other countries as well.

136
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:14,670
This is certainly true in a
very significant way in China.

137
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:18,050
But if it's not just
isolated in China and the US

138
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:23,060
is that they have big
networks of users.

139
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,310
They collect data
and particularly

140
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:29,780
if you're a marketplace
like Amazon or Alibaba.

141
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,270
When you're selling
product, you're

142
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,070
seeing both sides of a market.

143
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:37,580
You're seeing the consumer
side, the hundreds of millions

144
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,470
of people in China or
the tens of millions

145
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,730
of people in the US.

146
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,100
But you're seeing
the merchant side.

147
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,190
And so that data, and that
flow, and that activity

148
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:50,030
gives you a natural
competitive edge.

149
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:52,370
And then lastly, what
was just mentioned

150
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:55,250
is automatic
payment, particularly

151
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:59,450
if you're in an online
platform selling something.

152
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:02,060
You see that merchant's
payment stream,

153
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,130
but also, you lower
the credit risk.

154
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,050
Because consumers are buying.

155
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,500
You take your piece to pay
back, whether it's a revolving

156
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,340
or term loan to a merchant.

157
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:15,980
So a lot of competitive
edges or even advantages

158
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:19,700
in this space for
them to build upon

159
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,945
to provide a credit product.

160
00:08:22,945 --> 00:08:24,820
TA: Sijin would also
like to share a thought.

161
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,750
GARY GENSLER: Yeah, please.

162
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,880
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think
the case of Alibaba

163
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,020
is really interesting.

164
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:33,200
Because just like
Gary had mentioned,

165
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,820
there are a lot of
transaction data

166
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,880
and also use their
data in Alibaba.

167
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,559
So right now, Alibaba not
only offer the payment system,

168
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,600
it also offer a credit system.

169
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,610
You can borrow
money from Alibaba.

170
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:50,010
Actually, it has its own
credit system that can--

171
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,420
I mean, the credit rating.

172
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,330
They can determine
how much money

173
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,100
you can borrow from Alibaba.

174
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,700
So I think this case
is fairly interesting.

175
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,150
GARY GENSLER:
Yeah, so two things

176
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:04,340
that I think I want to tease out
of that is the idea of building

177
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,320
credit on top of payments.

178
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,480
Now, this is not
a new phenomena.

179
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,620
This goes back centuries
that any good banker

180
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,810
knew that if you were in
the center of payments,

181
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:16,220
you had more information.

182
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:21,110
You had more data, even
in a pre-computer age.

183
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:24,230
But what we find is a lot
of the big tech companies

184
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:29,030
as well as the disruptors chose
to get into the payment space

185
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:32,240
and then build upon that credit.

186
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,090
Now, as it relates
to Alibaba, what

187
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:38,030
better way to do that
than to provide a payment

188
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:41,750
mechanism to purchase the
products on your platform,

189
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,310
similar with Amazon?

190
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,200
And then you can build
credit upon that.

191
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,930
Because you've got an
incredible amount of data.

192
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,970
But also, you can
provide credit in what's

193
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:53,360
called point-of-sale credit.

194
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,620
Buy something, pay for it over
6 weeks, 8 weeks, 10 weeks

195
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:01,970
when you're purchasing,
so good points.

196
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,760
So what is marketplace
lending, this phenomena

197
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,512
that started out at
the United Kingdom?

198
00:10:08,512 --> 00:10:10,220
We'll talk a little
bit about LendingClub

199
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:16,710
here in the US, started about
a dozen to 15 years ago.

200
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,530
What is it in its theory?

201
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:21,590
And where is it right now?

202
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:25,760
Anybody want to chat
about that for a minute?

203
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,330
LendingClub, LendingTree--
a lot of companies

204
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,670
that we can chat about here.

205
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,170
TA: Alida?

206
00:10:34,818 --> 00:10:37,130
AUDIENCE: Yes, the
marketplace [INAUDIBLE]

207
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:41,310
lending instead of the concept
of allowing individuals

208
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:44,640
to lend to other
individuals or companies

209
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,410
through a marketplace.

210
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,800
And while they've been
around for a while,

211
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,030
they've really just come
into lending platforms.

212
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:58,110
And they're really supported
by a securitization market

213
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:01,830
behind them now, rather
than individuals lending

214
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,997
on the platform
for the most part.

215
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:04,830
GARY GENSLER: Right.

216
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:05,330
Right.

217
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,770
And Michael spoke about
this earlier as well.

218
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,610
I think it's an
interesting concept,

219
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:14,010
but that it hasn't actually
lived up to its early promise.

220
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:20,700
The promise, when this
came about in 2005 to 2007,

221
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,330
was that you and I could use
the internet to communicate.

222
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:27,510
And I could lend to you, and
you could borrow from me,

223
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:33,180
peer to peer, without
a central intermediary.

224
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,760
Now, there was always going
to be some intermediary.

225
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:42,000
Because there was a platform, a
software provider taking a fee,

226
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,200
but somehow matching
lenders to borrowers

227
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,320
in a peer-to-peer network.

228
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,800
What we found over
these 13 or 15 years

229
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,570
is that the marketplace
lenders like LendingClub

230
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:01,050
have shifted to
securitization market

231
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:05,490
to raise their money, a
highly organized and somewhat

232
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:08,730
centralized market
securitization market.

233
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:12,390
And on the lending side,
you're still very much saying

234
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,620
that you're going
through a portal

235
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,830
and that there's only so
many of these portals.

236
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:20,790
So it's not that it's
truly peer to peer.

237
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:24,090
And in fact, often it's now
called marketplace lending

238
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:26,790
in its platforms.

239
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:30,540
I think that it's still
a very important part

240
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,420
of the disruptive
credit landscape,

241
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,320
but it's a small percentage
of that marketplace.

242
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,120
And it's shifting very
dramatically from peer

243
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,330
to peer to online portals.

244
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:47,130
It's still access centralized
credit in many ways.

245
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:47,820
And we'll see.

246
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,278
And we'll chat a
little bit about--

247
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:51,150
LendingClub is even now buying--

248
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:55,140
announced earlier in
2020 to buy a bank

249
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,735
and merged with the bank itself.

250
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,740
And then there's already
been some discussion

251
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,710
of alternative data,
but alternative data

252
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:11,810
building upon a history
in many countries

253
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:16,510
for four or five decades to use
data to make credit decisions

254
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,410
by changing it.

255
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:21,070
And I see a hand raised
on this, maybe, Romain?

256
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,480
Or no?

257
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,920
TA: I don't see
any hands raised.

258
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,210
I'm sure one will come up.

259
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,250
GARY GENSLER: Going down.

260
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,560
So where does that take us?

261
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,780
Let me go back to Facebook
Libra just for a moment.

262
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,560
And this is where we
closed our last class is

263
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,250
that Facebook Libra had
announced in June of 2019.

264
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,550
And then the People's
Bank of China

265
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:45,550
had already been working on
the digital currency project.

266
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:49,633
But then they sped that
up a bit and announced

267
00:13:49,633 --> 00:13:52,050
within a month or two that
they were going to move forward

268
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,060
with their currency project.

269
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:57,510
Libra had announced
a token pegged

270
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,670
to four or five
other currencies,

271
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:03,180
so is a multi-currency basket.

272
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,730
And there was a lot of
push-back from central banks

273
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:08,340
around the globe on
this concept that they

274
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,320
would create what
Facebook actually

275
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,000
announced-- a global currency
for billions of people.

276
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,530
There was concern amongst
the G7 and G20 countries,

277
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:23,250
but there was also concern of
a broader group of countries

278
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,980
developing countries as
well as to what this meant

279
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:31,140
for their monetary policy, how
stable this would really be,

280
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,620
and whether it would
compete with fiat currencies

281
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:37,208
in not just a positive way,
but maybe a negative way.

282
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,000
And there were also a
lot of concerns about

283
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,830
whether it would support
and somehow become

284
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:46,110
the domain of illicit activity--

285
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:48,560
drug runners, and the
like, and so forth.

286
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,660
So Facebook is a big company.

287
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,373
They stub their toes
from time to time.

288
00:14:55,373 --> 00:14:57,040
This might have been
one of those times,

289
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,540
but it was an
innovative project.

290
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,210
So they announced last
week some changes.

291
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:04,100
And most importantly
for this conversation--

292
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,180
and this is just a
slide taken from--

293
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:10,190
I think it was a
Medium post I found.

294
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:13,780
They said that Libra
would now be a platform.

295
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:17,190
And they would do
single currency tokens--

296
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:21,700
a euro token, a US dollar token,
a sterling token, et cetera,

297
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,420
et cetera.

298
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,430
They'll still have
a multi-basket,

299
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:27,820
a multi-currency basket
coin called Libra.

300
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,120
But they'll have what's, in
essence, stable value tokens.

301
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,150
And they feel that there's
still enough opportunity

302
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,800
or as what we talked about--
pain points in the payment

303
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,820
system that a dollar token, a
euro token, a British sterling

304
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:48,600
token, and the like is relevant
and an important layer.

305
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,970
What Libra also
announced is that they're

306
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:56,380
taking a tiered approach
to this whole topic

307
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:00,130
of anti-money laundering
and know your customer.

308
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:03,550
In essence, working with
governments around the globe,

309
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:09,220
they're saying they would only
work with wallet providers.

310
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,990
This would be single
currency wallet

311
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:15,010
providers or multi-currency
Libra wallet providers.

312
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:18,840
They'd only work with a
digital wallet provider

313
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:23,010
if it was in a jurisdiction
that had regulation

314
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:26,370
and those wallets
and exchanges, if it

315
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:29,340
was on a crypto exchange
were well regulated

316
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:32,610
within those countries or at
least regulated and registered

317
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:36,750
within those countries under
the guidance around the globe

318
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,060
that's issued by the FATF.

319
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:42,600
The Financial Action
Task Force is anti-money

320
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,833
laundering standard
setters around the globe.

321
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,250
And they had said
that they wanted

322
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,410
to take a tiered
approach that would even

323
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:53,970
include on the permissioned
blockchain in the protocol

324
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:57,150
layer, in the software
itself some protections

325
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,170
against sanctions.

326
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,628
Now, they didn't
say whether it was

327
00:16:59,628 --> 00:17:03,700
sanctions that were UN
sanctions, European sanctions,

328
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,619
US sanctions.

329
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:07,349
And then you get into some
interesting geopolitical issues

330
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:10,619
as to how Libra,
the associations

331
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:12,240
would sort through this.

332
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,530
But it's interesting.

333
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,839
Facebook is not giving
up, just because there's

334
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,460
a lot of push-back.

335
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,920
And for those of you that
might watch this online

336
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,670
and might watch it
in 2021 or 2022--

337
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:27,660
but this course will have a life
for a while, offered online.

338
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,090
It'll be interesting
to look back

339
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:33,300
to see what other adjustments
at Facebook and Libra,

340
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:37,650
done in '20 and
2021, to continue

341
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:46,650
to meet the official sector and
bring this thing to life going

342
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:47,400
forward.

343
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,890
Any questions on Libra?

344
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,060
I had the opportunity.

345
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:54,240
They actually reached out to
me last week after our class.

346
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,150
And they wanted to give you a
little briefing to your faculty

347
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,640
member on this.

348
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,145
TA: I don't see any
hands raised, Gary.

349
00:18:05,145 --> 00:18:06,145
GARY GENSLER: All right.

350
00:18:06,145 --> 00:18:08,840
So I'm going to
sneak into credit.

351
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,148
So what are the credit sectors?

352
00:18:10,148 --> 00:18:11,190
I mean, we all know them.

353
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:15,820
This is pretty straightforward--
household sector

354
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,340
and corporate sector.

355
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,630
But the household
sector-- the big pieces.

356
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:22,400
And those of you that
took the half semester

357
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,210
of consumer finance
course remember all this--

358
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:28,930
mortgages, autos, credit cards,
personal loans, student loans.

359
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:31,060
And then you can
have sub-sectors.

360
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,340
If you're thinking about
disrupting this space,

361
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,040
you would think, all right,
where am I going to slice into?

362
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,670
Am I going to try to do
something in mortgages,

363
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,750
or credit cards, or where?

364
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:45,130
Am I going to try to go to
the high end, the low credit

365
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,110
risk super prime?

366
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:50,730
Or am I going to try to be
in the sub-prime marketplace?

367
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,520
And these markets are vast.

368
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,410
They're vast in
nearly every country.

369
00:18:56,410 --> 00:19:00,490
So you'd pick and target what
you're actually going for

370
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:04,030
and literally whether you're
picking debt consolidation

371
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:08,140
or point-of-sale
lending matters as well.

372
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,180
The corporate sector
is interesting.

373
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:13,870
In terms of fintech,
the corporate sector

374
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:18,160
has been disrupted
dramatically in earlier decades

375
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,770
by the securitization markets.

376
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:24,100
And asset securitizations
happen primarily

377
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,500
around the household sector.

378
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,990
But asset
securitization or a way

379
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:33,580
to fund lending through
the securities markets

380
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:37,090
has come to the real
estate and more recently

381
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:41,560
to the collateralized loan
markets or CLO markets.

382
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,570
But in fact, when
we really think

383
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:45,970
about these markets,
what's been focused

384
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:49,090
on in terms of
financial disruption

385
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,550
is primarily the
household sector.

386
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:54,490
And then I circled
the small business

387
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:56,650
and small and
medium-sized enterprise.

388
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:59,110
Now, SME, mid-market
companies could

389
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,640
be defined all sorts of ways.

390
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,550
In the middle of this
corona crisis in the US,

391
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,740
we seem to have latched
on to companies that

392
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,560
are less than 500 employees.

393
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,790
It's not a specific definition
somewhere around the globe.

394
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:18,500
But large enterprises can
access the securities markets

395
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,000
directly.

396
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,730
Large enterprises
are, by and large,

397
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:25,210
borrowing from big banks
or securities markets.

398
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:27,580
And the greatest
opportunities have really

399
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:32,710
been in the small business
or SME market place.

400
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:35,830
And it could be products
like cash advance products,

401
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:38,380
purchased credit,
working capital lines.

402
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,270
We'll get a little
bit into this.

403
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:42,970
But again, if you're
thinking about credit,

404
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,410
it's a vast market.

405
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:48,700
And it's not one to just forget
about all the little pieces

406
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,810
in there.

407
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:52,040
Romain, I think there
were some questions.

408
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:52,730
Sure.

409
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:54,400
TA: Yes, we have a
question from Victor.

410
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,320
GARY GENSLER: Please.

411
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,150
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
see the point

412
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:07,905
of why [INAUDIBLE]
euro, dollar, whatever.

413
00:21:07,905 --> 00:21:09,280
The stable dollar
already exceeds

414
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,170
in the cryptocurrency market.

415
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:15,040
And I even, in that case, fully
understand what [INAUDIBLE]

416
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,092
with less fees.

417
00:21:17,092 --> 00:21:17,800
GARY GENSLER: OK.

418
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,170
So, Romain, Victor was
cutting in and out.

419
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:24,880
I think, if I understood the
question, is back to Facebook

420
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,230
and why they have the stable
individual currencies,

421
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,340
but I'm not certain.

422
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,630
I'm sorry.

423
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:37,180
So around the globe,
there are definitely

424
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:41,950
shortcomings of our fiat payment
systems, these pain points.

425
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:45,430
Some of it just relates to
whether the payment systems

426
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,800
are 24 hours a day,
seven days a week.

427
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:53,230
In terms of the euro, actually
the target payment system

428
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:59,950
run by the European Central Bank
does have attributes of 24/7.

429
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:03,050
The US-- we have more
challenges in that regard.

430
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:08,050
But the bigger issue often
in payment systems are costs.

431
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:13,680
And so what Facebook
Libra is saying is,

432
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:19,440
we can provide something that
can compete in this space.

433
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,560
But money is already
digital Fiat money,

434
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,940
the euro is already digital.

435
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,490
So Libra and Facebook
are not providing that.

436
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:29,330
They're saying this is
a different digital euro

437
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:32,130
or a different digital
dollar that can maybe

438
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:35,160
move 24 hours a day,
seven days a week

439
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,080
where you can get
instantaneous settlement.

440
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,990
Now, the US Federal
Reserve is moving there.

441
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:42,300
And we'll be there
by 2023 or '24.

442
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,970
And in fact, even in the
US, the clearinghouse,

443
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,820
as we talked about,
the organization

444
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:53,130
of about 24 major banks have
it in a continuous real time

445
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,300
payment system.

446
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,540
Europe is already moving to that
continuous real time payment

447
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,040
system.

448
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:03,240
So you might say, why would a
Libra euro compete with that?

449
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:07,880
Partly because it would be
on the Facebook platform.

450
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,620
And the thought is that
Facebook would embed it

451
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,850
into their system.

452
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,800
It's to some extent
to try to compete

453
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,890
with what Amazon, and
Alibaba, and Tencent

454
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:20,800
are doing elsewhere as well.

455
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,580
But implied in your
question is, so what?

456
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,270
Why would this matter?

457
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:28,210
And I think it's a
competitive landscape.

458
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:31,750
And time will tell us whether
it will really matter.

459
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,700
Because we already
had digital euros.

460
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,920
This would be a different
form of a digital euro.

461
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,080
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
of an overlap, I guess.

462
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,205
GARY GENSLER: That's right.

463
00:23:40,205 --> 00:23:41,320
That's right.

464
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,120
TA: And I think, Gary,
on the same topic,

465
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,667
we might have a
question from Luke.

466
00:23:44,667 --> 00:23:45,500
GARY GENSLER: It is.

467
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,340
Luke?

468
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,500
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

469
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,500
GARY GENSLER: Again, Luke
is not coming through.

470
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,220
I don't know.

471
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,450
AUDIENCE: I'm here.

472
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:54,970
So each question is, what
is the main difference

473
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:58,420
between Libra 1.0 and the 2.0?

474
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:01,600
Because 1.0, I believe, was
suggesting currency basket.

475
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,680
And second question was
regarding LendingClub.

476
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,040
It's down a lot--

477
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:10,210
42% in three months and
93% since five years.

478
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:14,890
And will it drive during this
consumer equity crunch that

479
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:18,310
is the quarantine
recession we have now

480
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:20,800
or suffer from high leverage?

481
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,410
Because it acquired a
brick and mortar bank,

482
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:25,890
which seems untimely these days.

483
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:29,460
And regarding the
currency basket,

484
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,750
wouldn't it suffer
during economy downturns

485
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:34,600
when there's a distortion
between safe currencies

486
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:42,070
such as the US dollar, Swiss
franc, and the emerging market

487
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:46,000
currency that is R&B or
whatever they're really

488
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,308
putting in the basket?

489
00:24:47,308 --> 00:24:48,100
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

490
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,780
First, let me compliment.

491
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,380
I love the Edvard Munch
that you have behind you.

492
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,820
I assume it's just a visual.

493
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:59,210
But if it's an original,
protected safely.

494
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:01,600
To your second
question, LendingClub,

495
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,650
I think that all of
the marketplace lenders

496
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:09,010
have some challenges in the
middle of the corona crisis.

497
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:13,310
I think that their early promise
has improved that completely.

498
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:15,940
So you're right that it went--

499
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,380
it's a public
company, actually--

500
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:17,950
LendingClub.

501
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,020
It went public.

502
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,970
Its stock came off
dramatically, 70% or 80%,

503
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:26,860
even well before
this corona crisis.

504
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:31,120
Then within the crisis, it's
come off some more as well.

505
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,140
It's buying a bank.

506
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,120
It's not technically a
bricks and mortar bank.

507
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,660
That bank, I think, has one
location in Massachusetts,

508
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,550
maybe in Boston.

509
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:41,380
It's an online bank.

510
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,150
And what they're trying to do--

511
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:45,670
their theory of the
case is that they want

512
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,440
to lower their borrowing costs.

513
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,260
Because marketplace
lenders-- and we'll see this

514
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,690
in a moment--

515
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:57,060
arrange with some
banks to borrow money.

516
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:01,000
So marketplace lenders
are from the markets.

517
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,200
Some of it's securitized,
some from banks.

518
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,540
And what they're saying is,
we can maybe lower our costs

519
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:09,060
by embedding a bank.

520
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:12,510
Back to Libra, and
Facebook, and the like,

521
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:17,030
the main difference
between Libra 1.0 and 2.0

522
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,362
are the two that I mentioned.

523
00:26:18,362 --> 00:26:20,820
I mean, they would say there's
three or four other changes.

524
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:28,320
But one is rather than only be
a multi-currency coin, Libra,

525
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,275
they're adding individual coins.

526
00:26:30,275 --> 00:26:32,400
They're not getting rid of
the multi-currency coin.

527
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,780
The multi-currency
coin is still there.

528
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:38,310
It's still their aspiration
to have a multi-currency coin.

529
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:40,830
But they're adding
the single coins

530
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:45,070
to try to give a new euro
digital dollar to it.

531
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,865
And secondly, they're
adding much more--

532
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:54,710
know your customer anti-money
laundering regimes by saying,

533
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:59,290
look, we're only going to work
with digital wallets and crypto

534
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:02,160
exchanges in certain
jurisdictions which

535
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:06,160
are registered and following
anti-money laundering law.

536
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:11,590
And additionally, we'll embed
in the software some protocols,

537
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:16,390
literally in the software to
guard against either sanctions

538
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:17,620
and some other things.

539
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:21,250
Whether this will be enough to
satisfy the official sector,

540
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,540
yet to be seen.

541
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,880
It looks like they're moving
first with Switzerland

542
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,070
and trying to have Switzerland's
regulator, FINMA, capture

543
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,597
it and move forward.

544
00:27:30,597 --> 00:27:32,680
I'll take one brief-- more
question, because we've

545
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,140
got a lot to cover, but sure.

546
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:38,230
TA: So Cindy had
her hand up for one.

547
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:40,855
If you want to talk,
unmute yourself, please.

548
00:27:40,855 --> 00:27:41,480
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

549
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,690
I'll just ask briefly.

550
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:48,100
But with household
private sectors,

551
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:52,390
how are they preventing
against predatory lending?

552
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:55,850
Because just through reading
some of the articles,

553
00:27:55,850 --> 00:28:00,850
it seems like that becomes a
gray line when you're targeting

554
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:04,270
specific type of
customer who doesn't

555
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:07,427
qualify for traditional loans.

556
00:28:07,427 --> 00:28:09,760
GARY GENSLER: So you're talking
about more broadly, just

557
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,750
in terms of, how do we
guard in any country

558
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,090
against predatory lending?

559
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:16,850
It's hard.

560
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:17,650
It's hard.

561
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:23,140
The entire credit space
has a lot of protections

562
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:26,260
and regulations starting in--

563
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:30,220
well, I would say starting
hundreds of years ago, really.

564
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,590
One would even go back
to the Hammurabi Code

565
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:34,950
and say there was regulation
of interest rates.

566
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:38,350
But in the modern
days, we embedded--

567
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,840
let's take the US for a moment.

568
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,570
Two really important things.

569
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:45,010
One was the Equal
Credit Opportunity

570
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:48,550
Act or what some
people call ECOA,

571
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:51,347
which was in the
late 1960s and then

572
00:28:51,347 --> 00:28:53,680
something called the Fair
Credit Reporting Act, I think,

573
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,880
by 1972.

574
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:00,490
These two came out of an earlier
way, the fintech, an earlier

575
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:05,950
wave of credit cards, an
earlier wave of lending

576
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:10,818
and directly to this question
about whether it was fair

577
00:29:10,818 --> 00:29:11,860
and whether it was equal.

578
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:15,790
Everybody had the same access,
Equal Credit Opportunity Act,

579
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:18,790
that you couldn't differentiate
because of gender, or race,

580
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:23,800
or nationality, and the like
and Fair Credit Reporting,

581
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,470
that those credit reports.

582
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:31,270
The things that we came to know
and in about 30 countries rely

583
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:35,440
on, is these FICO scores from
a company called the Fair Isaac

584
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,170
company, that those scores--

585
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:40,710
we'd have to be able to
know something about them.

586
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:43,120
And if we were
turned down, somebody

587
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,980
has to explain to us
how we were turned down.

588
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,950
Well, now, fast forward to 2020.

589
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:51,790
Absolutely.

590
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,840
The question is right.

591
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,770
How can we protect that
we still have equal credit

592
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:59,110
and that it's explainable?

593
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:00,980
And why is somebody turned down?

594
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:06,310
And once somebody is not
allowed to take credit,

595
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:09,400
it gets tougher with artificial
intelligence and machine

596
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:09,980
learning.

597
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,530
It also gets tougher
when there's not

598
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:13,510
a physical location.

599
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:15,550
And thirdly, many
of these companies

600
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:19,030
are not regulated or
registered as banks.

601
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:21,760
And regulators around
the globe tended

602
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:27,670
to look to banks to make
sure that these laws were

603
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:28,780
fairly applied.

604
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:31,850
Now, they also look to the
credit reporting agencies.

605
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:35,740
So I think the real answer
is in these changing times,

606
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:38,860
the official sector
around the globe

607
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:43,570
has to adapt and sometimes
change a little bit of who

608
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:47,110
is regulated and even if you're
a non-bank, that you still

609
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:50,417
have to comply with some of
these things, importantly.

610
00:30:50,417 --> 00:30:51,250
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

611
00:30:53,448 --> 00:30:54,990
GARY GENSLER: So
let me just give you

612
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:56,460
a sense of the size and scope.

613
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,280
The household sector--
you can look at this later

614
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,010
in the Canvas slides, but
the household sector--

615
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:03,610
grown dramatically.

616
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:08,100
And if you look in
the United States,

617
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:12,510
we're no longer the
top percent of GDP.

618
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:16,380
In fact, I think
Luke is in Korea now.

619
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,980
Your country is now peaked
up to be number two.

620
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,280
But look at China.

621
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:25,440
China from 10 to 20% of
GDP just 15 years ago.

622
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,080
And all of a sudden, 50% of GDP.

623
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,990
So these markets have grown
a lot in many countries.

624
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:33,990
I wouldn't just think
about this in the US.

625
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:36,510
And Brazil and India--

626
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:39,220
I would predict, will grow
significantly as well.

627
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:44,730
Now, in the US, we've got about
$14 trillion of household debt.

628
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:48,690
Before the corona crisis, we
had at $22 trillion economy.

629
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:50,970
And so you could
see it's about 2/3

630
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:55,590
of our economy, the underlying
consumer household debt.

631
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:58,635
The corporate sector--
very important as well.

632
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,610
But it's the household
sector dominated in the US

633
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:07,710
by mortgages--

634
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:11,730
2/3 of that 2/3 or about
$10 trillion, $11 trillion

635
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:14,760
of mortgage market.

636
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,820
But each of these markets
are really significant.

637
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:20,190
Even the auto lending market--

638
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:27,360
it might look small at these
numbers here, but they're not.

639
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,210
That's a big number
when you come at it

640
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:32,550
and if you wanted to
pursue that business.

641
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:35,340
And a little bit on the
non-financial corporate debt

642
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,290
market--

643
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:38,930
we'll see this shake out.

644
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:42,000
Post the corona crisis,
a lot of these numbers

645
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,860
will go up significantly.

646
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:48,090
And I would say one thing
just off the topic of fintech.

647
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:52,800
I think that though we
didn't enter this crisis

648
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:57,100
with a household debt
problem in most countries,

649
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:01,550
we had a real household debt
problem going into 2008 crisis.

650
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:04,890
While we didn't enter this
with a household debt crisis,

651
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:07,210
within three to six
months in most countries,

652
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:09,690
we will have a household
debt crisis, I fear.

653
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:16,120
Because the consumer sector
can't be supporting their auto

654
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,130
loans and credit card loans.

655
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,750
And one of the
reasons I think this

656
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:22,420
is unlikely to be
of the recession,

657
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,490
but it's going to be
a long U recession,

658
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:26,110
almost like it's
a bathtub trying

659
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:29,590
to get out the slippery
slopes of this recession,

660
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,870
is around the globe,
households are

661
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:34,440
going to have to repair
their balance sheets.

662
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,760
You're going to have to
slowly repair balance sheets.

663
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:40,990
And it's not going to
be easy, so true also

664
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:43,990
in the corporate
sector, most likely.

665
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,850
But the market design matters--

666
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:48,710
if you are creating
a fintech company,

667
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:51,190
you would think about
the market design.

668
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:53,420
And I'm not going
to dive into this.

669
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:56,530
But each one of these
pieces gives an opportunity

670
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:58,570
to break into the
credit markets.

671
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,400
It might be around data.

672
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:05,110
You might have a particular area
that you could do better data

673
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,940
or like Credit Karma.

674
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:12,610
Credit Karma was really about
providing free credit scoring.

675
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:15,610
Think about this-- just
free credit scores.

676
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:18,880
And Credit Karma then
could cross sell and market

677
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:22,060
your products Credit
Karma company was

678
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:26,654
formed less than 10 years
ago, sold earlier in 2020

679
00:34:26,654 --> 00:34:31,030
for $5 billion to
Intuit, Intuit that

680
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:36,370
has the TurboTax,
and this accounting

681
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:37,630
software, and the like.

682
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:45,030
But Credit Karma had 106
million individual files

683
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:49,260
on various folks, not all
of whom are their customers.

684
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,610
But they cross sell.

685
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:53,790
They had nearly a billion
dollars in revenue in 2019.

686
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:55,290
It might be on the funding side.

687
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:59,310
You might have a new way to do
securitization or your issuer

688
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:00,307
bank partnership.

689
00:35:00,307 --> 00:35:01,140
And we talked about.

690
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,780
LendingClub had an
issuer bank partner.

691
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:06,690
Now, they're trying
to buy a bank.

692
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,670
It might be on the funding side.

693
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:11,750
And that's what peer-to-peer
lending tried to do.

694
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:14,970
And they haven't been
as broadly successful.

695
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:18,300
Most importantly, I would
say that it's usually

696
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,510
been on user experience
and user interface.

697
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:24,660
And sometimes it's that you
got in through the payment

698
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:28,710
channels, like Toast getting
into the restaurant sector

699
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,970
through the payment.

700
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:32,280
Toast was a company
out of Boston.

701
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,900
It was really about software.

702
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,760
It was about
tablets and hardware

703
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:41,160
as well, that the restaurant
server had a better user

704
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,000
experience.

705
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,980
And the restaurant had
a better experience

706
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,980
in the tablet and payment side.

707
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,260
And then they started
to build Toast credit

708
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,660
to provide those
restaurants credit.

709
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:54,210
Now, there's going to be a
shakeout there, no doubt,

710
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:58,170
in terms of this crisis,
the corona crisis.

711
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:02,560
It might be that you're breaking
into some slice of risk.

712
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,760
And this has been a case
for a lot of companies

713
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,820
that have broken into manage
one risk or another better.

714
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:12,640
And then lastly,
what role are you in?

715
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,260
In the mortgage markets here
in the US-- and we found

716
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:20,570
that origination
has really changed.

717
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:22,490
And we'll look at the
competitive landscape.

718
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:26,810
But companies like Quicken
Loan, and PennyMac, and others

719
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,160
have broken in.

720
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,260
And they've broken in
on the origination side.

721
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:33,410
And that's partly because the
uniqueness in the US mortgage

722
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:34,250
market--

723
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:37,100
that our government-sponsored
enterprises guarantee

724
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,000
the bulk of the market.

725
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,040
So the balance sheet
credit risk is diminished.

726
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,380
And Quicken Loan, and PennyMac,
and others can come in.

727
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,520
And probably over
half the market

728
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,700
is originated by
companies that are broadly

729
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:55,130
speaking disruptors.

730
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,750
So again, it could be data.

731
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:57,630
It could be funding.

732
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,630
It could be the user
experience, which

733
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:04,340
is really a critical one,
maybe the risks, the roles.

734
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,980
Any piece of these might
give an opportunity

735
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:10,100
to break into a market or
to do something different

736
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,720
than the financial incumbents.

737
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:20,140
So the earlier
fintech, way back--

738
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:22,840
I'm going to take you to a
story about an earlier fintech

739
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,530
that I like.

740
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:25,900
It's just credit cards.

741
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,640
The first use of
the term credit card

742
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,690
was in the 1880s
in a dystopian--

743
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:33,880
I would call it, but
utopian book that

744
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,830
was written by Edward Bellamy.

745
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:37,780
It was a New York
Times bestseller.

746
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:41,170
It was a bestseller in multiple
languages around the globe,

747
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:43,570
talking about the year 2000.

748
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:46,030
Well, Bellamy-- you could go
back and look at the book.

749
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,010
It's really science fiction.

750
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:50,890
But use the term credit card.

751
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:53,020
It's the first known
use of the concept

752
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:56,920
that you would have
a card for payments.

753
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,400
Well, shortly thereafter, not
really because of Bellamy,

754
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,880
you saw a bunch of companies
starting to use charge coins

755
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,020
and charge cards.

756
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:08,980
And by the 1920s,
these merchant cards--

757
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:12,970
you had an individual merchant
providing credit and saying you

758
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:14,860
can buy something on credit.

759
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:17,380
You could call that a
point-of-sale credit.

760
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:20,320
Earlier fintech-- about
a hundred years ago.

761
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:26,230
But in the 1940s, one
banker in Brooklyn

762
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:28,720
never made a lot of
money for themselves.

763
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:34,900
One banker came up with the
concept of a credit system

764
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:38,170
where it was multiple merchants.

765
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:41,410
Not one merchant, but
multiple merchants.

766
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:43,720
And that charge card--

767
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:49,420
75 years ago, so a long time
ago, but still somewhat recent.

768
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:52,030
And that led to
the 1940s and '50s,

769
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:55,060
all these innovations--
the first plastic card.

770
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:58,300
BankAmericard was from
a California bank.

771
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,430
And that's where Visa started.

772
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:03,850
So all of that was
fintech of the time.

773
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:05,460
And the only reason
I mention it is

774
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:08,740
if you think about what
disruptions have come before

775
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:11,260
that now we take for
granted, sometimes

776
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,960
that's evidence in
what you might do now.

777
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,590
BankAmericard was
a California bank

778
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:20,980
that was trying to partner with
other banks around the country

779
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,480
and partnered with
other countries

780
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:27,280
to do something that was more
universal for the country.

781
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,490
The Diners Club was literally
about this restaurant concept.

782
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:32,710
You would consider it almost
like a general merchant

783
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,720
card, an early Toast.

784
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,940
The Diners Club did
what maybe Toast

785
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:39,880
is trying to do now,
inside the restaurants,

786
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:45,910
providing more use of those
initially high-end restaurants

787
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:46,840
on the East Coast.

788
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:53,360
So what disruptions are
in the value chain now?

789
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:57,510
And particularly,
this little chart--

790
00:39:57,510 --> 00:40:02,120
I borrow from an interesting
long paper on it,

791
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,940
is think about the different
parts of the value chain.

792
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:07,100
Whether you're sourcing
capital, you're

793
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,420
actually assessing credit.

794
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:10,430
That's the underwriting
of the credit

795
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:13,040
or actually just
servicing the credit

796
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,360
like you're servicing
a student loan.

797
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,150
It can be any part
of the value chain.

798
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,550
And you could go in and disrupt.

799
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,890
And we're not going to
dive into this chart.

800
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:24,147
But I'll just take
disbursements for a minute.

801
00:40:24,147 --> 00:40:25,730
If you look at that
vertical, it could

802
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:28,580
be digital wallets,
or virtual currency,

803
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:30,200
or the machine learning.

804
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:34,470
If it's in credit assessment, it
could be the alternative data.

805
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:37,970
So each of these provides
a little opportunity

806
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:41,540
to disrupt the current
business model.

807
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:44,350
And so we talked about
payments last class, credit.

808
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:46,660
You really have to
get, in a sense,

809
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:49,930
granular into which
part of the value chain.

810
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:52,510
And then, how do I
bring a technology to it

811
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:54,430
that maybe the big
incumbents aren't yet

812
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:58,300
doing in a sufficiently
sophisticated way?

813
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,130
Or you might just
bring it to one sector

814
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:02,560
like Toast did to the
restaurant sector.

815
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,020
It might be sector specific.

816
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,640
So where do we go?

817
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,400
Well, we've already
seen big techs there,

818
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,350
the payment unicorns.

819
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:13,300
There's hundreds of
other payment companies

820
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:17,480
that are building credit
on top of payment.

821
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:21,080
And sometimes a payment
company is really also a credit

822
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:26,070
company, like Brex is
both payment and credit.

823
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:28,640
AvidXchange is mostly
payment, but is

824
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:35,040
moving into credit and then some
that are built just on credit.

825
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,540
And so I thought I would
start with the business side--

826
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:41,240
small, medium-sized
enterprise lending.

827
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,380
Again, there's no really
good definition of SME.

828
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:46,970
But the definition that these
companies would take at it--

829
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:49,760
they would say
these are companies

830
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,420
that are having difficulty
borrowing from the big banks.

831
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:57,870
It's either assessing
credit or providing

832
00:41:57,870 --> 00:42:03,370
that credit in a timely
and a cost-effective way.

833
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:06,640
Brex is an interesting company
that started around the concept

834
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:11,560
that, I can't get
money as a startup.

835
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,300
How can I even get a
credit card if I had a--

836
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:24,220
it's a mixture of seed investing
and credit card provisions.

837
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:26,800
Some of these companies I
put on here like Amazon,

838
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,750
Alipay are big tech.

839
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,370
I don't think you
can leave them out.

840
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:33,190
Some started in the
payment side like Square

841
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:36,280
and Stripe and Toast--

842
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,140
which I mentioned earlier--

843
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:39,190
PayPal.

844
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:42,460
All provide small and
medium-sized enterprise

845
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:43,350
lending.

846
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:48,520
Some are really just
like Kabbage and Lendio,

847
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:53,770
provide comparison, that you can
go on the Lendio prop platform,

848
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:56,190
and you can compare
and contrast.

849
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:59,200
They're more like a
broker or an agent

850
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,310
than actually
making the lending.

851
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:05,050
And Funding Circle is
one of the only ones

852
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:08,700
that is a little bit in
the marketplace lending.

853
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:11,100
Do I see some questions, Romain?

854
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,980
I'm doing a thumbnail
taste test here.

855
00:43:17,072 --> 00:43:19,030
TA: So in the chat,
there's quite some activity

856
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,145
about LendingClub.

857
00:43:20,145 --> 00:43:21,520
Perhaps you can
provide the class

858
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,680
with an overview of
their business model.

859
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,920
And what are the challenges
they've been facing?

860
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:26,920
GARY GENSLER: All right.

861
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:31,030
I'm going to do that
in about 10 minutes.

862
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:35,020
So I'll hold that if I can.

863
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:38,740
LendingClub has been more
about the household sector

864
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:41,110
than the small and medium size.

865
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:42,010
I'll ask this.

866
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:44,530
Has anybody in the
class actually worked

867
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:48,400
at a startup, worked at any
corporation that's barred

868
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,660
from one of these companies?

869
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:57,620
TA: Alida, you've
unmuted yourself.

870
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:58,223
Yeah?

871
00:43:58,223 --> 00:44:00,640
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I was
at Citibank at the time,

872
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:05,990
that Citibank partners with
C2FO as a partnered [INAUDIBLE]

873
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:06,490
program.

874
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:11,140
We financed some of the smaller
suppliers in those programs

875
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:13,030
by large [INAUDIBLE].

876
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:14,570
GARY GENSLER: So
it's interesting.

877
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:15,380
Could you share?

878
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:21,460
Why did Citibank partner
with C2FO, rather than

879
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:23,120
make those loans themselves?

880
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,480
And this is an important--

881
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,650
the relationship
with the incumbents

882
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:28,140
between the disruptors.

883
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,400
Why in that one
circumstance do you

884
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:35,387
think Citi chose to partner,
rather than do it on their own?

885
00:44:35,387 --> 00:44:37,720
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] an
interesting model that actually

886
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:41,550
allows the corporate to
lend to its suppliers

887
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:43,735
is the easiest way
to say it would

888
00:44:43,735 --> 00:44:45,640
have been short-term firm.

889
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:50,530
But if you look at a
company and supplier base,

890
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:53,720
you'll see that 80/20
rule applies fairly well.

891
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:56,770
So the top 20
suppliers are generally

892
00:44:56,770 --> 00:45:00,400
supplying appropriate with the
majority of their inventory.

893
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:05,410
[INAUDIBLE] Purchasing on that
bottom tail of the suppliers

894
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:06,100
is--

895
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,860
they're all very
small businesses.

896
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:08,860
They're hard to lend to.

897
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:14,440
It's very hard to do all
the KYC requirements, which

898
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:18,240
is really what Citibank does
not like doing [INAUDIBLE]..

899
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,920
And so a company
like C2FO could come

900
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,500
in there, partner with
a corporate [INAUDIBLE],,

901
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:27,777
and lend to or extend credit
to a supplier [INAUDIBLE]..

902
00:45:27,777 --> 00:45:29,610
GARY GENSLER: So this
is an important aspect

903
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:30,940
that Alida just raised.

904
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:33,130
Large incumbents
sometimes don't feel

905
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:36,580
that they can, in a
cost-effective way,

906
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:39,250
assess the credit and
reach the distribution

907
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:41,200
to small businesses.

908
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,570
And then the disruptive
companies say, well, wait,

909
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:44,380
we could provide.

910
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:46,090
That's a little
crack in the system.

911
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:48,850
That's something we can have
more financial inclusion,

912
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:50,740
whether it's Brex
for the startups,

913
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:56,650
C2FO for a lot of the small
businesses, and the like.

914
00:45:56,650 --> 00:45:59,020
And the incumbents say
all right, we can't.

915
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:04,520
But we can, through C2FO
and others, reach them.

916
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,530
And then it helps
down the supply chain.

917
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:08,170
I think Ivy's hand
was up, maybe?

918
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:08,930
TA: Yes, correct.

919
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:11,545
Ivy, go ahead.

920
00:46:11,545 --> 00:46:12,170
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

921
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:14,600
So I use to work
in securitization.

922
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:18,480
And Brex is one of my
clients and then also worked

923
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,700
at a startup that
uses Brex, too.

924
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:24,770
And so I think, though,
to your point of--

925
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:27,530
their user interface
is pretty amazing.

926
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:31,430
And they've also just
have really identified

927
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:33,920
this white space of startups.

928
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,810
But I think where
we got comfortable

929
00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:42,080
in terms of the diligence is the
fact that they're pretty much--

930
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:46,160
it's a very elegant way of just
having these startups making

931
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:49,680
sure that they have literally
enough cash in the account.

932
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,770
So they're monitoring that.

933
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:54,560
Basically, if you have
access to these startups,

934
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,150
bank account, day to day.

935
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:57,980
And they started with startups.

936
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:01,460
And they've been very, I
think, thoughtful about which

937
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:04,880
sectors they're going to, like
life sciences, and e-commerce,

938
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:09,110
and now having cash management,
which also makes a lot of sense

939
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:12,410
in terms of just having
yield, so just wanted to offer

940
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:14,180
a little bit more color there.

941
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:17,150
GARY GENSLER: And Brex
started with this concept

942
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:20,780
of, how does entrepreneurs
get money when you

943
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:22,590
don't have any track record?

944
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:23,090
Right?

945
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:24,882
Literally, you don't
have any track record.

946
00:47:24,882 --> 00:47:28,400
They had to also
rely on something

947
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,660
we've talked about already--

948
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:30,680
OpenAPI.

949
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:31,950
They had to get data.

950
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:33,440
And they had to do
it, as you said,

951
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:38,120
in an efficient, elegant way to
get that data and get access.

952
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,640
Do you have cash in your
account, so to speak?

953
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:44,240
And now, they've grown
up a certain expertise

954
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:47,380
in that startup world.

955
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:49,490
And it's not equity
that they're funding.

956
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:53,660
It's loans, basically,
against the cash flow.

957
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:56,420
What you'll see also
on here is, as I

958
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:59,480
said, some of the big
tech companies like Amazon

959
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,340
and Tencent and Alipay.

960
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:04,400
You see some of the really,
now incumbent fintechs,

961
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:08,430
as some folks would call
them, like Stripe and Square

962
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:13,940
and PayPal and Intuit that have
built up a long history now,

963
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:18,260
either in the payment space or
in the tax prep and accounting

964
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:20,660
space, as some have
come from accounting.

965
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:22,700
Some have come from
the payment side

966
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:25,370
where they're getting data
and corporate business

967
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:26,840
relationships.

968
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:29,958
What you don't see is a
lot of the challenger banks

969
00:48:29,958 --> 00:48:32,000
that we're going to talk
about in our next class.

970
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,740
Now, Prosper is here.

971
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:35,390
They've started to
offer some lending

972
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:36,920
side to the corporate side.

973
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,890
Most of the challenger
banks and nearly all

974
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:43,430
of the marketplace
lenders that are of size

975
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:45,350
are in the household
sector, rather than

976
00:48:45,350 --> 00:48:49,260
the corporate sector,
which I find of interest.

977
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,950
I don't if there's a question.

978
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:53,240
TA: We have two hands raised--

979
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,400
Camillo and then Carlos.

980
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,400
GARY GENSLER: All right.

981
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:59,180
And then we're going to go
to the household sector.

982
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:01,740
AUDIENCE: OK, this is
about the household.

983
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:05,610
I'm sure you know about this
Brazilian unicorn called

984
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:06,372
Nubank.

985
00:49:06,372 --> 00:49:07,580
GARY GENSLER: Oh, absolutely.

986
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:07,770
Yeah.

987
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:10,103
And we're going to be talking
about Nubank a fair amount

988
00:49:10,103 --> 00:49:11,338
next Monday as well.

989
00:49:11,338 --> 00:49:11,880
AUDIENCE: OK.

990
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,520
I just want to know--

991
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,780
well, maybe next class.

992
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:18,750
Do you think that their
business model about giving

993
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:21,180
online credit cards to--

994
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:22,440
I don't know.

995
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:27,450
I think it's 8.5 million people
already, who have a Nubank

996
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:30,680
credit card, is sustainable.

997
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:34,030
Because I don't know what's
their specific innovation,

998
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:37,410
apart from accepting
applications

999
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:38,940
on line of credit cards.

1000
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:42,280
Just I'm wondering if
that's going to be--

1001
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:46,090
are they are going to have
some [INAUDIBLE] problem?

1002
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:48,670
GARY GENSLER: We'll dive more
into Nubank in the next class.

1003
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:50,250
But let me just
generically say, I

1004
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:55,200
think that it's the
reality of startups that

1005
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,690
more will fail than succeed.

1006
00:49:57,690 --> 00:50:00,540
Now, as it specifically
relates to credit cards,

1007
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:07,980
in the credit card
space, the big incumbents

1008
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,780
aren't going to keep
the whole market.

1009
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:13,530
And maybe that leads
me for a minute.

1010
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:16,860
I'm going to come back
to mortgages in a second.

1011
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:18,510
This is the US
credit card system.

1012
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:20,070
It's not Brazil.

1013
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:23,280
But the big seven, what
I call, or the big eight

1014
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,530
being the big four
or five banks--

1015
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:28,920
American Express,
Discover, and Cap One--

1016
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:34,020
control 80%, 78%
as of last year--

1017
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:35,280
credit card business.

1018
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,980
There are a lot of
economies of scale.

1019
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:41,160
There's a lot of economies of
scale back to managing risk

1020
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,660
and balance sheet.

1021
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:45,150
Credit cards as
opposed to mortgages

1022
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:48,510
are not guaranteed in any
way by the US government.

1023
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:51,870
It has a very
different risk profile.

1024
00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:57,000
This is about a little over
$1 trillion asset class market

1025
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:57,820
in the US.

1026
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:02,010
But 22% are smaller providers.

1027
00:51:02,010 --> 00:51:06,390
And so Amazon, for instance,
partners with Synchrony Bank.

1028
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:08,910
And Amazon has the
Synchrony card.

1029
00:51:08,910 --> 00:51:11,310
Amazon also, I think, has
something with JP Morgan

1030
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:12,150
as well.

1031
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:14,760
You'd probably say Amazon
will be sustainable.

1032
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:19,500
Amazon is such a phenomenal
profit generator,

1033
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,690
particularly with
the crisis now.

1034
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:24,360
I can't speak to
any one startup.

1035
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:27,780
Can they chip away at this 22%?

1036
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:30,930
Yes, they can by using
alternative data.

1037
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:33,540
But the big seven or
eight are not asleep.

1038
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:36,230
They're not ignoring
alternative data.

1039
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:39,060
But a new startup
can say, maybe we

1040
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:41,860
can approach this
in a different way

1041
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:45,930
and particularly provide
a better user interface.

1042
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:49,680
Here in the US, what's happening
is rather than credit card

1043
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:54,030
products, they're
providing personal loans.

1044
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:56,250
But let me hold on
that for a second,

1045
00:51:56,250 --> 00:52:00,220
because I want to go back
to the mortgage market.

1046
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:03,370
I mentioned this in
the mortgage market.

1047
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,160
These are figures from 2018.

1048
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:09,030
These are the largest mortgage
originators in the US.

1049
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:11,040
It doesn't mean that
they bought these loans

1050
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,020
and held them on
their balance sheet.

1051
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:16,500
The yellow are the non-banks.

1052
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,050
And PennyMac, for some
reason, is not on here.

1053
00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:20,540
They should be.

1054
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:26,670
But of the top 10, 5,
the yellow are non-banks.

1055
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:29,010
Now, do we call them fintechs?

1056
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:29,830
Absolutely.

1057
00:52:29,830 --> 00:52:35,920
They are giving a different
user interface with the public,

1058
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,700
and they've just taken off.

1059
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:39,170
Part of it is regulatory.

1060
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:42,140
Part of it is since
the 2008 crisis.

1061
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:43,970
Holding loans on
the balance sheets

1062
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:46,460
become less attractive
to the big banks.

1063
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:50,180
In terms of their capital
charges and the like,

1064
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:52,280
part of it is also
because in the US,

1065
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:55,880
this is highly tied to
the government-sponsored

1066
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:56,990
enterprises.

1067
00:52:56,990 --> 00:53:00,560
But big disruption in the
last 12 years, that about half

1068
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:03,930
of the loans are originated
by, broadly speaking,

1069
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:08,210
yeah, the non-banks sector who
are largely then laying it off

1070
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:11,930
to the asset
securitization marketplace.

1071
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:13,640
Disruption of the past--

1072
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:15,290
I believe there'll
still be disruption

1073
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:17,830
in the future in this space.

1074
00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:19,960
Back to the credit
card side, what we

1075
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,730
were talking about
there with Camillo--

1076
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:24,010
and I'll pause if
there's other questions.

1077
00:53:24,010 --> 00:53:26,650
I just want to take
a look also at China.

1078
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:29,800
China's biggest
credit card issuers--

1079
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:33,040
all that are building upon
that UnionPay platform

1080
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:33,760
we talked about.

1081
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:38,530
UnionPay was started by, I
think, 84 banks in China,

1082
00:53:38,530 --> 00:53:41,380
really with the People's Bank
of China bringing that together.

1083
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:46,690
UnionPay is that one backbone of
their whole credit card payment

1084
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:47,890
system.

1085
00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:52,180
Interestingly, as dominant and
as strong as Alipay and WeChat

1086
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:53,200
Pay are--

1087
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,690
and in a sense,
WeChat Pay and Alipay

1088
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:58,290
leapfrogged the banking system.

1089
00:53:58,290 --> 00:54:02,260
There's real growth going on
in the credit card business,

1090
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:04,840
but not from disruptors
and startups.

1091
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:08,850
It's like the commercial
banks getting back into it.

1092
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:10,990
Romain where there
some questions?

1093
00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:12,350
TA: Yes, Alessandro?

1094
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:15,060
GARY GENSLER: Please.

1095
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:15,900
AUDIENCE: Yes, Gary.

1096
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:19,710
I'd like to get your point of
view on the following topic.

1097
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:23,400
So I was thinking about
how these new credit card--

1098
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,080
think that companies work.

1099
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:27,900
And most of them,
not all of them--

1100
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:31,080
they got to partner up
with the bank, right?

1101
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:33,820
Unless they have huge
amount of cash anticipated,

1102
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:37,587
they got to partner up with a
bank that gives actual credit.

1103
00:54:37,587 --> 00:54:38,920
GARY GENSLER: Let me just pause.

1104
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:42,270
They either have to partner
with a bank, which is the issuer

1105
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:43,680
bank partner model.

1106
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,380
And we're going to get to
LendingClub, I promise,

1107
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:50,220
that has that issuer partner,
that bank that's a partner.

1108
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:54,210
Or they tap into the
securitization markets.

1109
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:56,760
And so for those who
are not familiar,

1110
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,920
asset securitization
is the concept

1111
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:04,130
that the securities markets
are the investors in the loans,

1112
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:06,590
rather than holding
it on a bank's balance

1113
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:09,560
sheet or a finance
company's balance sheet.

1114
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:12,980
And that innovation, asset
securitization starting

1115
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:17,480
in the mortgage markets
40-plus years ago moved

1116
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:24,470
to the credit card markets
in a robust way by the 1990s,

1117
00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:29,000
is a very real way
to lay off that side,

1118
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
meaning find somebody
else to be the investors,

1119
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,390
rather than have
a balance sheet.

1120
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:34,700
So back to you, Alexandro.

1121
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:39,010
It's either a partner bank
or asset securitization.

1122
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:41,620
AUDIENCE: So in the
end, these guys,

1123
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:46,750
these fintech companies are
second intermediary, right?

1124
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:49,810
So how much money do
they actually make?

1125
00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:54,100
Because I'm thinking the more
and more companies we can see,

1126
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,670
the fees are going to go down.

1127
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:58,420
So competition will
drive their fees down.

1128
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:00,400
They also have to
pay a fee to-- you'd

1129
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,970
see they're a balance
sheet bank or in the case

1130
00:56:03,970 --> 00:56:05,960
of securitization, too.

1131
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,960
GARY GENSLER: So you're
absolutely right.

1132
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:13,900
But financial intermediation
has multiple layers.

1133
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:17,860
And the more advanced
an economy is, usually

1134
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:19,000
the more the layers.

1135
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,440
And the more competition in
the market, more the layers.

1136
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,830
And you might think of
layers as inefficiency.

1137
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:28,030
It might be.

1138
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:31,360
But often, layers would bring
efficiency and competition.

1139
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:35,650
So some financial firm
is doing the origination.

1140
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:39,760
This is brokering and selling
and providing a user interface.

1141
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,360
And they might not want to
be the balance sheet lender.

1142
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:44,708
They might say, I'm going
to partner with the bank

1143
00:56:44,708 --> 00:56:46,000
to be the balance sheet lender.

1144
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,730
What we're going to do is
we're going to compete and give

1145
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:52,840
the most remarkable, robust
user interface and brokerage.

1146
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:57,310
In the mortgage market, back to
that, the Quickens, and United

1147
00:56:57,310 --> 00:57:00,470
Wholesale Mortgage, and
PennyMac that aren't on here,

1148
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:04,870
by and large, only hold the
mortgage for a few weeks,

1149
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:07,500
a few days, maybe
a couple months.

1150
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:10,030
They have a warehouse
line of credit to do that.

1151
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:12,550
And then they
securitize the rest.

1152
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:14,080
But the mortgage
market in the US

1153
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:17,170
has a very robust
securitization market.

1154
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:18,980
You asked about credit cards.

1155
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:23,830
Credit cards-- this 22%
that's competing with the rest

1156
00:57:23,830 --> 00:57:28,870
does not have as big a
robust securitization market.

1157
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:31,330
Of the trillion
in the US, I think

1158
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:36,040
the credit card securitization
market is about $150 to $200

1159
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:38,410
billion if I recall.

1160
00:57:38,410 --> 00:57:41,170
So it's harder.

1161
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:45,550
But it might be that company,
the Nubank, as Camillo asked,

1162
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:49,090
that has a better use of
underwriting, and data,

1163
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:51,520
and so forth.

1164
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,730
What somebody wouldn't give
for Credit Karma's data

1165
00:57:54,730 --> 00:57:56,680
with 106 million files?

1166
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:59,020
That's a robust data set.

1167
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:02,120
Now, Intuit, we know,
paid $5 billion.

1168
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:06,160
So maybe we do know what
somebody would pay for it

1169
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:10,240
I wouldn't diminish being
at one particular slice.

1170
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:13,750
If you can find the
slice in the value chain

1171
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:17,260
and compete away some of
the incumbent's margin,

1172
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:21,385
credit cards are very big
business-- trillion dollars

1173
00:58:21,385 --> 00:58:24,130
in the US, very big in
Europe and Asia as well,

1174
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:27,220
growing in China rapidly.

1175
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:29,440
And there's a lot of margin.

1176
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,813
I would say the thing
that's competing the most--

1177
00:58:31,813 --> 00:58:32,980
and I'm going to jump ahead.

1178
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:35,800
But, Alexandro, stay
with us for a minute--

1179
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:38,710
is the personal loan business.

1180
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:42,730
Personal loans differ
from credit cards

1181
00:58:42,730 --> 00:58:46,900
in an important way, is that
credit cards are what's known

1182
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:50,430
as a revolving line of credit.

1183
00:58:50,430 --> 00:58:53,430
Each purchase adds to
your credit balance.

1184
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:54,870
You have a limit.

1185
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:58,980
If you're high, if you're super
prime or a prime borrower,

1186
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:00,030
your limit is higher.

1187
00:59:00,030 --> 00:59:03,010
If you're sub-prime,
your limit is lower.

1188
00:59:03,010 --> 00:59:07,500
That business of
revolving credit--

1189
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:10,200
about a trillion
dollars in the US.

1190
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:12,270
We now have this
personal loan business.

1191
00:59:12,270 --> 00:59:15,540
It's only about one sixth
the size, about $160 billion

1192
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:17,340
in the US.

1193
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:19,620
That personal loan
business is generally

1194
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:23,670
term financing, a
specific term that you

1195
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:28,800
have to have an installment loan
and pay once every month for 36

1196
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:33,610
months or for 48 or 60 months.

1197
00:59:33,610 --> 00:59:35,890
The underwriting
risk of a term loan

1198
00:59:35,890 --> 00:59:39,490
is lower than the underwriting
risk of credit card

1199
00:59:39,490 --> 00:59:42,520
business or revolving credit.

1200
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:46,210
The personal loan business is
where most of the disruptors

1201
00:59:46,210 --> 00:59:47,180
are.

1202
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:51,820
The SoFis, and the Prospers,
and the Nubanks, and so forth--

1203
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:56,090
they're trying to break
in the personal loan

1204
00:59:56,090 --> 01:00:02,015
side as much or even more
than the credit card side.

1205
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:02,890
But I don't know if--

1206
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:06,675
Alexandro, did you want
to follow up on anything?

1207
01:00:06,675 --> 01:00:07,550
AUDIENCE: No, no, no.

1208
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:09,970
My point was just--

1209
01:00:09,970 --> 01:00:11,660
I don't know if you
agree on the fact

1210
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:18,380
that we would see a
massive wave of mergers

1211
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:21,230
between these companies.

1212
01:00:21,230 --> 01:00:26,350
I mean, in my mind, there's
not much room for all

1213
01:00:26,350 --> 01:00:28,370
of these hundreds of
companies that are just

1214
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:30,783
popping up like mushrooms here.

1215
01:00:30,783 --> 01:00:32,450
GARY GENSLER: I think
we'll see mergers.

1216
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:34,700
And I think we'll see failures.

1217
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:38,000
But the question is,
is there an opportunity

1218
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,590
in the midst of all of that?

1219
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:43,360
Is there an opportunity
along the way?

1220
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:45,920
We've seen in the payment
space a lot of consolidation

1221
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:48,920
and the payment system
providers, the PSPs.

1222
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:51,380
But there's still a
lot of opportunity

1223
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:54,440
for sector-specific
payment companies.

1224
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:58,010
And we've even seen that the
data aggregators in the payment

1225
01:00:58,010 --> 01:01:03,260
space have started to
combine and be bought

1226
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:06,020
where that phase of things.

1227
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:09,020
I think in the
household credit space,

1228
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:11,870
we're going to see still
a lot of competition--

1229
01:01:11,870 --> 01:01:13,107
personal loan.

1230
01:01:13,107 --> 01:01:14,690
And I think in the
personal loan side,

1231
01:01:14,690 --> 01:01:17,490
they will be chipping away
at some of the profit margin,

1232
01:01:17,490 --> 01:01:21,290
so will be trying to, at least,
of the incumbents in the credit

1233
01:01:21,290 --> 01:01:22,340
card space.

1234
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:25,220
And interestingly in China,
the credit card space

1235
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:28,870
is trying to chip away at what
Alipay and WeChat Pay built up.

1236
01:01:28,870 --> 01:01:34,100
Because there was a reverse
over there that's happened.

1237
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:36,770
Whether they'll be completely
successful-- another story.

1238
01:01:39,267 --> 01:01:40,100
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

1239
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:42,090
GARY GENSLER: [INAUDIBLE]

1240
01:01:42,090 --> 01:01:46,330
TA: [INAUDIBLE]

1241
01:01:46,330 --> 01:01:47,470
AUDIENCE: Yeah, sorry.

1242
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:50,200
So I have a question
on that point

1243
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:55,750
that you brought up on UnionPay
being an attractive alternative

1244
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:57,325
to Alipay and WeChat Pay.

1245
01:01:57,325 --> 01:01:59,150
GARY GENSLER:
[INAUDIBLE] I'm just

1246
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:02,560
going to say it's been growing
more quickly than I might

1247
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:05,650
have thought, that
I wouldn't count out

1248
01:02:05,650 --> 01:02:08,575
credit cards in China.

1249
01:02:08,575 --> 01:02:09,450
They've been growing.

1250
01:02:09,450 --> 01:02:11,825
AUDIENCE: Would you know what
were the value propositions

1251
01:02:11,825 --> 01:02:15,660
of UnionPay that liked
their consumers to opt

1252
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:17,456
to its UnionPay?

1253
01:02:17,456 --> 01:02:18,092
Yeah.

1254
01:02:18,092 --> 01:02:19,300
GARY GENSLER: Well, I'm not--

1255
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:23,350
I mean, maybe some of our fellow
students know better than I.

1256
01:02:23,350 --> 01:02:25,090
But I think, listen,
you can't count out

1257
01:02:25,090 --> 01:02:27,610
that there's a distribution
channel when you have

1258
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:31,600
84 banks and particularly the
six or eight big banks in China

1259
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:36,850
that own a piece [INAUDIBLE]
and all the hundreds of millions

1260
01:02:36,850 --> 01:02:38,110
of people there.

1261
01:02:38,110 --> 01:02:39,460
They're not asleep.

1262
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:43,630
As big tech comes in, the
incumbents don't rest.

1263
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:45,370
It's competition.

1264
01:02:45,370 --> 01:02:48,580
But they do have the advantages
of incredible distribution

1265
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:53,440
channel, meaning the depositors
and clients of those banks.

1266
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,680
The product itself, the
revolving credit product,

1267
01:02:56,680 --> 01:03:00,580
the classic credit
card product has

1268
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:03,520
a little bit more flexibility
than something just

1269
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,290
on an e-money wallet.

1270
01:03:05,290 --> 01:03:08,170
And it doesn't mean
Alipay and WeChat Pay

1271
01:03:08,170 --> 01:03:10,852
can't offer something that
is pretty much identical

1272
01:03:10,852 --> 01:03:12,060
to a credit card [INAUDIBLE].

1273
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:13,060
AUDIENCE: That's right.

1274
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:15,335
GARY GENSLER: But their
balances and the like

1275
01:03:15,335 --> 01:03:16,960
might be different
as well, but I'm not

1276
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,450
sufficiently close to it.

1277
01:03:18,450 --> 01:03:20,580
AUDIENCE: OK, cool.

1278
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:23,490
Thank you.

1279
01:03:23,490 --> 01:03:26,950
GARY GENSLER: And I might
pull some data for next class.

1280
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:30,010
I'll show you what I'm
talking about there.

1281
01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:31,960
Personal loan business--
just to give you

1282
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:35,530
a percentage of unsecured
personal loans, who is

1283
01:03:35,530 --> 01:03:37,930
making unsecured personal loan?

1284
01:03:37,930 --> 01:03:41,320
And again, a personal loan
is not tied to a credit card.

1285
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:44,000
It's usually an
installment or term loan.

1286
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,780
But you can see the shift
just in these five years,

1287
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:51,740
that the disruptors are
eating into the market

1288
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:53,735
share in this space.

1289
01:03:53,735 --> 01:03:55,610
Here are some of the
personal loan companies.

1290
01:03:55,610 --> 01:03:57,570
Not a lot of overlap.

1291
01:03:57,570 --> 01:03:58,920
Prosper is on both lists.

1292
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:01,250
But not a lot of
overlap with the list

1293
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:03,700
to the small and medium size.

1294
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:06,410
And Camillo, I'm glad
I have NuBank on here.

1295
01:04:06,410 --> 01:04:08,090
But we'll come back
to a few of these

1296
01:04:08,090 --> 01:04:09,800
when we talk about
challenger banks--

1297
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:12,740
Revolut, Nubank.

1298
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:14,720
A number of these are
really what we also

1299
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:17,780
call as challenger banks.

1300
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:21,170
Student loans-- I could probably
ask for a show of hands.

1301
01:04:21,170 --> 01:04:24,710
How many of you have a
student loan by one of these?

1302
01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:29,720
And in the US, the private
student loan market

1303
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:32,090
is only a small share.

1304
01:04:32,090 --> 01:04:34,580
Student loans in
the US are dominated

1305
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:37,340
by our Department of Education.

1306
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:40,330
Over 92% of student
loans in America

1307
01:04:40,330 --> 01:04:43,970
are either guaranteed or direct
loans from the Department

1308
01:04:43,970 --> 01:04:45,140
of Education.

1309
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:47,210
But of course, the
private loan market

1310
01:04:47,210 --> 01:04:50,090
where graduate students and
particularly those who are not

1311
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:52,850
US citizens are more likely
in the private student loan

1312
01:04:52,850 --> 01:04:53,850
market.

1313
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:56,190
These are probably familiar
names to many of you,

1314
01:04:56,190 --> 01:05:01,220
whether you used MPower, or
Prodigy, or others, basically

1315
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:04,580
to shop for a student
loan or a traditional bank

1316
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:08,410
like SunTrust and Wells Fargo.

1317
01:05:08,410 --> 01:05:14,300
And that 8% of that market is
still about $100-plus billion.

1318
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:19,440
Because the overall student
loan market is $1.6 trillion,

1319
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:22,290
so not small numbers.

1320
01:05:22,290 --> 01:05:23,750
So marketplace lending--

1321
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:26,450
I did say we would get to this.

1322
01:05:26,450 --> 01:05:29,360
It's an online
platform connecting

1323
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:31,400
borrowers and investors.

1324
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:33,970
So it's a platform
in the middle,

1325
01:05:33,970 --> 01:05:36,980
started with this concept
of being peer to peer.

1326
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:38,870
And so this is a
look at LendingClub

1327
01:05:38,870 --> 01:05:42,090
from their own documents
from last summer.

1328
01:05:42,090 --> 01:05:47,460
LendingClub-- 3 million-plus
borrowers on one side

1329
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:52,110
of the platform economics,
200,000-plus investors

1330
01:05:52,110 --> 01:05:53,050
on the other side.

1331
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:55,860
Now, don't think of it
as 3 million and 200,000,

1332
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:58,960
because it gets more
concentrated than that.

1333
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:01,230
But LendingClub
sits in the middle,

1334
01:06:01,230 --> 01:06:04,770
between borrowers and
investors, or you might

1335
01:06:04,770 --> 01:06:06,990
call lenders, but investors.

1336
01:06:06,990 --> 01:06:10,448
But they partner
with issuing bank.

1337
01:06:10,448 --> 01:06:12,990
They don't want to take a lot
of this on their balance sheet.

1338
01:06:12,990 --> 01:06:15,770
They take some of it
onto their balance sheet.

1339
01:06:15,770 --> 01:06:21,130
But they want to basically have
issuing bank partners plural,

1340
01:06:21,130 --> 01:06:25,350
because they keep some
banks in competition.

1341
01:06:25,350 --> 01:06:27,190
And so what LendingClub
is providing

1342
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:31,460
is the platform and some
of those issuing banks.

1343
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:33,050
They're not the
Bank of Americas,

1344
01:06:33,050 --> 01:06:34,570
but they're much smaller banks.

1345
01:06:34,570 --> 01:06:37,430
Say, all right, we don't
have that front end.

1346
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:39,770
We don't have that platform,
that user experience.

1347
01:06:39,770 --> 01:06:43,470
LendingClub provides that.

1348
01:06:43,470 --> 01:06:46,960
And the investors on the
other side of a LendingClub

1349
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:51,560
are often hedge funds.

1350
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:58,820
And asset managers are
saying we can invest.

1351
01:06:58,820 --> 01:07:03,230
LendingClub is providing
us a portfolio of loans.

1352
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:04,880
And you can see
the numbers here--

1353
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:09,440
16-month average
duration, 1 and 1.6 to 7

1354
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,360
and 1/2% range of returns.

1355
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:14,480
That's a pretty wide
range of returns.

1356
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:15,410
And who are they?

1357
01:07:15,410 --> 01:07:18,973
Managed accounts means it could
be an account at BlackRock

1358
01:07:18,973 --> 01:07:20,390
or Fidelity that
says, we're going

1359
01:07:20,390 --> 01:07:23,030
to put a little bit of
money into this credit

1360
01:07:23,030 --> 01:07:26,170
market and the like.

1361
01:07:26,170 --> 01:07:27,230
Now, Luke was right.

1362
01:07:27,230 --> 01:07:29,990
LendingClub and many of the
other marketplace lenders

1363
01:07:29,990 --> 01:07:31,700
were quite a dream.

1364
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:33,620
LendingClub happened
to go public.

1365
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:37,640
And then their market
value came down quite a bit

1366
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:40,610
as they had to prove out
whether they can make money.

1367
01:07:40,610 --> 01:07:42,598
Where have they been
in these last 10 years,

1368
01:07:42,598 --> 01:07:43,640
just to give you a sense?

1369
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:48,410
In 2010, only it was $100
million of originations.

1370
01:07:48,410 --> 01:07:51,710
But it was all retail
originations, by and large.

1371
01:07:51,710 --> 01:07:57,990
By 2018, the retail, which
is a very small part of it--

1372
01:07:57,990 --> 01:08:01,400
they're originating very--
quite a different bit

1373
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:05,960
of loans, how they're
originating these things.

1374
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:07,910
And China-- I just
want to mention

1375
01:08:07,910 --> 01:08:13,550
China went through a remarkable
wave of peer-to-peer lending.

1376
01:08:13,550 --> 01:08:15,140
And then the People's
Bank of China

1377
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:18,410
felt, no, we've got to
get control of this.

1378
01:08:18,410 --> 01:08:24,970
I mean, literally there was
2,700 peer-to-peer lending

1379
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:28,420
platforms in China
just 4 years ago

1380
01:08:28,420 --> 01:08:33,069
and most recent statistics
down to about 300-plus.

1381
01:08:33,069 --> 01:08:37,990
And in November of 2019,
the official sector in China

1382
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:40,899
still said this isn't right.

1383
01:08:40,899 --> 01:08:43,720
The peer-to-peer lenders
need more regulation.

1384
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:47,229
In essence, they need
bank-like regulation.

1385
01:08:47,229 --> 01:08:50,109
And what's interesting
is back to LendingClub,

1386
01:08:50,109 --> 01:08:51,819
LendingClub has
actually announced

1387
01:08:51,819 --> 01:08:55,029
the purchase of a bank.

1388
01:08:55,029 --> 01:08:57,609
Romain, I think I
saw a hand go up.

1389
01:09:00,257 --> 01:09:01,340
TA: I don't see any, Gary.

1390
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:03,760
GARY GENSLER: Oh, OK.

1391
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:07,100
But there were questions
earlier about LendingClub.

1392
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:07,600
TA: Yeah.

1393
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,430
So now, we have
two hands raised.

1394
01:09:09,430 --> 01:09:12,439
Let's go first with Jose.

1395
01:09:12,439 --> 01:09:15,240
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so I'm not
super familiar with LendingClub,

1396
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:18,090
but I'm familiar with
another one in Europe.

1397
01:09:18,090 --> 01:09:20,720
I think the way it works
is a bit different.

1398
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:23,516
I would like to hear your
opinion on that model.

1399
01:09:23,516 --> 01:09:25,850
GARY GENSLER: [INAUDIBLE]

1400
01:09:25,850 --> 01:09:27,132
AUDIENCE: Sorry?

1401
01:09:27,132 --> 01:09:28,299
GARY GENSLER: I'm listening.

1402
01:09:28,299 --> 01:09:28,799
Yes.

1403
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:30,265
AUDIENCE: So it's called Mintos.

1404
01:09:30,265 --> 01:09:31,890
I think it's the
biggest one in Europe.

1405
01:09:31,890 --> 01:09:33,473
And basically, what
they do is there's

1406
01:09:33,473 --> 01:09:36,920
a group of loan originators that
are independent companies that

1407
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:39,290
create these loans and
give out these loans.

1408
01:09:39,290 --> 01:09:45,740
And then these [AUDIO OUT]
[INAUDIBLE] loans

1409
01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:46,970
to independent investors.

1410
01:09:46,970 --> 01:09:49,950
But they guarantee the
payment of the loan.

1411
01:09:49,950 --> 01:09:54,440
So if the person that asked
for the loan doesn't pay,

1412
01:09:54,440 --> 01:10:00,990
the loan originator pays for
that payment to the investor.

1413
01:10:00,990 --> 01:10:03,110
So basically, the
risk for the investor

1414
01:10:03,110 --> 01:10:06,035
is that the loan
originators go bankrupt.

1415
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:09,862
I learned there's something
similar in the US to that.

1416
01:10:09,862 --> 01:10:11,570
GARY GENSLER: Well,
so what you're saying

1417
01:10:11,570 --> 01:10:15,560
is how they are
managing the risks.

1418
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:20,440
The investors are
taking a credit risk

1419
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:25,380
on the platform, the
originator, rather

1420
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:28,950
than taking a credit risk on the
portfolio of loans themselves.

1421
01:10:32,910 --> 01:10:34,327
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

1422
01:10:34,327 --> 01:10:35,910
AUDIENCE: --one more
layer in between.

1423
01:10:35,910 --> 01:10:37,290
So there's the loan originators.

1424
01:10:37,290 --> 01:10:39,360
And there's hundreds
of companies, then

1425
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,340
the platform that
connects the loan

1426
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:43,890
originators with investors.

1427
01:10:43,890 --> 01:10:48,270
And basically, the investors
invest in specific loans,

1428
01:10:48,270 --> 01:10:50,872
but they are guaranteed
by the loan originators.

1429
01:10:50,872 --> 01:10:52,330
GARY GENSLER: Why
don't we do this?

1430
01:10:52,330 --> 01:10:54,580
Why don't you shoot me an email?

1431
01:10:54,580 --> 01:10:56,920
And I'll try to take this
up in our next class.

1432
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:59,620
And I'll look at the
company more specifically.

1433
01:10:59,620 --> 01:11:03,960
But to the point,
there's no reason

1434
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:10,470
you can't find a new model as
to who takes the credit risk.

1435
01:11:10,470 --> 01:11:13,740
Credit risk is
inherent in lending.

1436
01:11:13,740 --> 01:11:16,860
Somebody is going
to repay on time.

1437
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:19,980
And others are going to fall
into delinquency or even

1438
01:11:19,980 --> 01:11:23,400
default. And so
then the structure

1439
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:26,320
of a market, whether
it's mortgages,

1440
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:30,270
credit cards, personal
loans, small businesses--

1441
01:11:30,270 --> 01:11:34,470
the structure of a
market might evolve

1442
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:39,360
as to how to slice up who
bears that credit risk.

1443
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:40,740
And there's not
just credit risk.

1444
01:11:40,740 --> 01:11:42,130
There's prepayment risk.

1445
01:11:42,130 --> 01:11:44,040
There's interest rate risk.

1446
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:46,500
There's numerous
financial risks.

1447
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:48,510
And so what's just being
highlighted by Jose--

1448
01:11:48,510 --> 01:11:49,590
and I apologize.

1449
01:11:49,590 --> 01:11:54,030
I just don't know that model,
is that the investors, rather

1450
01:11:54,030 --> 01:11:58,470
than bearing the direct
credit risk of the borrowers

1451
01:11:58,470 --> 01:12:01,590
are having some of
that held by others.

1452
01:12:01,590 --> 01:12:04,470
And they're bearing the
risk of the intermediary

1453
01:12:04,470 --> 01:12:07,260
in between the platform.

1454
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:10,860
And in essence, that's
true in the US mortgage

1455
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:14,030
market, a very different
part, what you asked about.

1456
01:12:14,030 --> 01:12:17,550
But the US mortgage
market conforming loans

1457
01:12:17,550 --> 01:12:23,790
are guaranteed by the government
or by the government-sponsored

1458
01:12:23,790 --> 01:12:26,280
enterprises so that
your risks then

1459
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:28,120
are a little bit different.

1460
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:29,460
It's not the credit risk.

1461
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:32,610
In the US mortgage market,
you have prepayment risk.

1462
01:12:32,610 --> 01:12:36,060
Will somebody pay
the mortgage early

1463
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:39,040
as interest rates might
go down and so forth?

1464
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:42,150
And then in parts of the
US mortgage market that

1465
01:12:42,150 --> 01:12:44,550
are not the conforming
mortgage market,

1466
01:12:44,550 --> 01:12:45,810
you did have credit risk.

1467
01:12:45,810 --> 01:12:48,070
Because the government
wasn't guaranteeing.

1468
01:12:48,070 --> 01:12:49,950
And a lot of the
sub-prime mortgage

1469
01:12:49,950 --> 01:12:53,253
mess that we got into
in 2008 was around that.

1470
01:12:53,253 --> 01:12:55,170
But rather than taking
time now, why don't you

1471
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:56,420
shoot me an email?

1472
01:12:56,420 --> 01:13:00,370
I'll look at this specific
company and come back.

1473
01:13:00,370 --> 01:13:02,400
Romain, were there
other hands up?

1474
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:04,955
TA: Yes, let's go with Akshay.

1475
01:13:04,955 --> 01:13:06,080
AUDIENCE: Hello, professor.

1476
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:10,040
So I had no question with the
business model of LendingClub.

1477
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:14,820
So what is the role of
issuing banks in this case?

1478
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:18,470
GARY GENSLER: So issuing
banks basically are

1479
01:13:18,470 --> 01:13:21,450
lending their balance sheet.

1480
01:13:21,450 --> 01:13:25,880
So let's say an issuing bank
has its own availability

1481
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:32,280
of depositors and has not built
the front end to the borrowers.

1482
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:36,360
So the issuing bank is
standing in to do that.

1483
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:41,210
In addition, they're actually
papering and documenting

1484
01:13:41,210 --> 01:13:42,440
the loans.

1485
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:44,360
So as you see on
this chart here,

1486
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:51,500
the issuing bank is sending
the loans out and taking it in.

1487
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:54,890
So there's a regulatory reason
that the issuing bank is there.

1488
01:13:54,890 --> 01:13:59,210
So the issuing bank might
issue the loans and hold them.

1489
01:13:59,210 --> 01:14:01,490
Or the issuing bank
might issue the loans

1490
01:14:01,490 --> 01:14:03,960
and then, literally,
as this chart shows,

1491
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:05,600
resell them to LendingClub.

1492
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:08,970
And LendingClub sells
them to investors.

1493
01:14:08,970 --> 01:14:13,240
So there's a bit of--

1494
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:16,810
it's similar to what's
called a warehouse line.

1495
01:14:16,810 --> 01:14:18,640
The issuing bank
is standing there

1496
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:23,830
ready to take loans,
but then resell them.

1497
01:14:23,830 --> 01:14:27,430
Because their capability
is only a certain size.

1498
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:30,580
LendingClub says they
did $10 billion of loans

1499
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:33,250
in 2018, if I recall the number.

1500
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:36,370
The issuing bank doesn't
want to put $10 billion on.

1501
01:14:36,370 --> 01:14:38,320
But they're providing
the liquidity

1502
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:43,270
for the first few days or weeks
until LendingClub then provides

1503
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:45,880
the investor to buy the loan.

1504
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:49,030
So it's similar to
a warehouse line,

1505
01:14:49,030 --> 01:14:52,600
but it's actually a
purchase and sale.

1506
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:56,890
They purchase the loan or
issue the loan and sell.

1507
01:14:56,890 --> 01:14:59,530
There's also a bit of
regulation that you actually

1508
01:14:59,530 --> 01:15:01,520
have a bank involved.

1509
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:06,220
And part of what was going
on, both in the UK and the US,

1510
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:09,220
is this marketplace.

1511
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:11,770
Peer-to-peer lending
started, is the platforms

1512
01:15:11,770 --> 01:15:14,470
didn't want to,
frankly, register

1513
01:15:14,470 --> 01:15:16,660
and be regulated like banks.

1514
01:15:16,660 --> 01:15:19,180
They needed somebody
else to make the loan

1515
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:22,208
to have that interface.

1516
01:15:22,208 --> 01:15:23,690
I oversimplified.

1517
01:15:23,690 --> 01:15:26,340
And probably a lawyer would tell
me I've gotten it a little bit

1518
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:27,860
wrong.

1519
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:30,660
TA: And then we have Adam
who would like to provide

1520
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:32,985
some insight on UnionPay.

1521
01:15:32,985 --> 01:15:33,860
GARY GENSLER: Please.

1522
01:15:33,860 --> 01:15:34,360
Please.

1523
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:36,880
And then [INAUDIBLE]
closed on alternative data.

1524
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:37,512
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1525
01:15:37,512 --> 01:15:39,470
In response to [INAUDIBLE]'s's
earlier question

1526
01:15:39,470 --> 01:15:44,180
about UnionPay, so UnionPay is
a state-owned credit and debit

1527
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:45,770
card network, all right?

1528
01:15:45,770 --> 01:15:51,440
So the one thing that separates
them from the [INAUDIBLE]

1529
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,540
duopoly between
Alipay and WeChat Pay,

1530
01:15:53,540 --> 01:15:56,900
which dominates 90% of the
market, is that it can be,

1531
01:15:56,900 --> 01:15:58,850
well, among other things.

1532
01:15:58,850 --> 01:16:02,240
They can be used for all mobile
devices and computer browsers.

1533
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:05,210
So technology wise, they
do have an advantage.

1534
01:16:05,210 --> 01:16:08,390
Because for WeChat
Pay, it's quite

1535
01:16:08,390 --> 01:16:11,300
restrictive in
terms of technology,

1536
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:13,490
because they're used
mostly on mobile.

1537
01:16:13,490 --> 01:16:15,890
And unlike Alipay
and WeChat Pay,

1538
01:16:15,890 --> 01:16:19,580
UnionPay actually supports
almost all currencies

1539
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:22,430
and operates in many
countries besides China,

1540
01:16:22,430 --> 01:16:24,740
also a feature that
both Alipay and WeChat

1541
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:29,150
Pay are struggling with,
due to the peculiarities

1542
01:16:29,150 --> 01:16:31,820
of the Chinese legislation.

1543
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:36,860
And the one thing is that
what UnionPay focuses on

1544
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:41,060
is the fact that they
focus on the efforts

1545
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:42,590
of those Chinese
account holders.

1546
01:16:42,590 --> 01:16:44,810
Because most people--
in fact, the majority

1547
01:16:44,810 --> 01:16:48,870
of the people who owns a credit
card will be UnionPay holders.

1548
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:51,980
They are focusing on people who
travel abroad, predominantly

1549
01:16:51,980 --> 01:16:53,750
to the US, in fact.

1550
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:57,290
So you see a lot
of shops that are

1551
01:16:57,290 --> 01:17:00,080
targeting for Chinese
customers and travelers.

1552
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:02,150
You would see that UnionPay.

1553
01:17:02,150 --> 01:17:03,710
They could actually
pay by UnionPay.

1554
01:17:03,710 --> 01:17:07,340
So these are the edge that they
have over Alipay and WeChat

1555
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:07,840
Pay.

1556
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:09,965
And that's just in response
to the earlier question

1557
01:17:09,965 --> 01:17:11,358
[INAUDIBLE].

1558
01:17:11,358 --> 01:17:12,150
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

1559
01:17:12,150 --> 01:17:14,390
What I'm going to do is--
because we only have two

1560
01:17:14,390 --> 01:17:17,300
minutes, is I'm going to hold
off and talk about alternative

1561
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:22,560
data when we start up our next
session on challenger banks

1562
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:29,570
and the like and just close
out with a little comment,

1563
01:17:29,570 --> 01:17:35,330
if I might, on just to--

1564
01:17:35,330 --> 01:17:38,490
what I've already said in our
first class on professionalism.

1565
01:17:38,490 --> 01:17:39,980
Hope this slide is there.

1566
01:17:39,980 --> 01:17:49,750
But again, is that I just
want to lend to you again

1567
01:17:49,750 --> 01:17:52,510
from my years of experience.

1568
01:17:52,510 --> 01:17:56,600
We're in a very unusual time
now with the corona crisis.

1569
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,810
And we're even at MIT.

1570
01:17:58,810 --> 01:18:05,140
It's these Zoom classes and pass
emergency, no credit emergency,

1571
01:18:05,140 --> 01:18:06,280
and the like.

1572
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:09,160
But I would just share with
you my own observation,

1573
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:12,490
that for those of you trying
to get the most out of this MIT

1574
01:18:12,490 --> 01:18:14,425
experience, it's not easy.

1575
01:18:14,425 --> 01:18:18,520
And in some ways, it's just
frustrating as heck, I'm sure.

1576
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:20,140
But again, to the
extent that you

1577
01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:22,990
can, to the extent you
can come prepared, and be

1578
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:27,160
curious, and reach out to
faculty members like myself,

1579
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:30,520
and leverage off of our
experience, take office hours,

1580
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:31,330
I would do it.

1581
01:18:31,330 --> 01:18:33,880
I know this is a lousy time.

1582
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:34,590
A lousy time.

1583
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:37,270
I'm just reminding
us all of that

1584
01:18:37,270 --> 01:18:41,750
and saying take whatever you
can out of this MIT experience,

1585
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:45,160
even if it's
diminished in some way.

1586
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:48,370
I want to make myself
available again.

1587
01:18:48,370 --> 01:18:51,800
If you find the readings
of interest, do them.

1588
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:54,850
If you can't get through them
because you're distracted

1589
01:18:54,850 --> 01:18:56,980
and you're looking
for a job, I get that.

1590
01:18:56,980 --> 01:18:57,580
I get that.

1591
01:18:57,580 --> 01:18:59,950
I'm just saying the
more you engage,

1592
01:18:59,950 --> 01:19:03,760
the more you will invest in
yourselves and get out of it.

1593
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:06,160
And on plagiarism--
and I say this just

1594
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:09,130
to remind people again.

1595
01:19:09,130 --> 01:19:11,880
There's probably-- it's going
to be hard for any of you--

1596
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:13,650
get no credit emergency.

1597
01:19:13,650 --> 01:19:17,190
But somebody might get no
credit emergency if you submit

1598
01:19:17,190 --> 01:19:21,720
a 1,000-word paper and 600
or 800 words are plagiarized.

1599
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:27,330
That's your pathway right
into that no credit emergency.

1600
01:19:27,330 --> 01:19:29,270
It's easy to avoid,
because you know

1601
01:19:29,270 --> 01:19:32,180
if you're taking a lot
from something else.

1602
01:19:32,180 --> 01:19:35,990
And I just say this, because
I have had those experiences.

1603
01:19:35,990 --> 01:19:37,790
I just mention it
again, just because I

1604
01:19:37,790 --> 01:19:42,050
want to do you the favor of
helping you make sure that even

1605
01:19:42,050 --> 01:19:45,770
in these unusual times,
that you protect yourself

1606
01:19:45,770 --> 01:19:50,960
if you want to get these 9
credits on your transcript.

1607
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:55,040
But mostly, I put this up again
at this part of the semester,

1608
01:19:55,040 --> 01:20:00,000
just to say, we want to make
this MIT experience as good,

1609
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,280
given all the
challenges as we can.

1610
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:07,530
And we know it's a
heck of a crazy time.

1611
01:20:07,530 --> 01:20:12,120
But to the extent you want
me off hours or another time

1612
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:14,740
or you've got questions that
I'll further research, just let

1613
01:20:14,740 --> 01:20:15,240
me know.

1614
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:17,623
Or if you have a fintech
startup, let me know.

1615
01:20:17,623 --> 01:20:18,540
And I'll be all there.

1616
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:19,860
And I'll read that, too.

1617
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:21,490
I had one student
recently send me

1618
01:20:21,490 --> 01:20:25,680
a whole paper on a fintech
startup, just outside of this.

1619
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:26,730
It's not an assignment.

1620
01:20:26,730 --> 01:20:28,440
But they're engaged
in a startup.

1621
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:31,765
And I'm going to review
it and give some feedback.
