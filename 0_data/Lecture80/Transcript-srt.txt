8
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,560
WILL MA: OK, so today
I'm going to take a more

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,790
empirical approach.

10
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,210
I feel like I've done a lot
of theory in this class,

11
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,730
so today I'm going to
play through the hands

12
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,190
of an online tourney,
so that I played,

13
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,890
and sort of show you the
most interesting hands

14
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:38,314
and show you exactly what I did.

15
00:00:38,314 --> 00:00:40,730
I don't think I'm going to
finish the whole tourney today.

16
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,040
But I'm going to go
through the first part,

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,070
and I'm only going to talk about
a few [INAUDIBLE] concepts,

18
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,710
but mostly just go
through the hands.

19
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,510
OK.

20
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:55,910
So it's a $55 buy-in
tournament on Party Poker.

21
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:57,330
And it's a fairly small field.

22
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,100
So this is a tournament
I played recently.

23
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,720
OK, so let's just
get into the hands.

24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,780
I'm only going to show you the
hands where I did something

25
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:09,620
at the start.

26
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,430
And we will start with
a bit of theory, OK.

27
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,700
So this is the situation.

28
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,450
It's folded to this player and--

29
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,040
so we have king and queen here.

30
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,290
And it's at hand where
we're in position,

31
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,430
and he raised from
late enough position

32
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,410
where I think our hand
is too good to fold.

33
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:31,640
So if Dreams crushed,
if the guy who raised

34
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,860
was from under the gun, let's
say, then I might have--

35
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,306
I probably would have folded.

36
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,930
Because against an
under-the-gun range,

37
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,930
king-queen off suit
kind of gets crushed.

38
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:45,490
But against a range from high
jack minus one or low jack,

39
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:47,750
I think king-queen is
good enough to play.

40
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,270
But the question is
sort of what do we do.

41
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,260
Do we raise?

42
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,464
Do we call?

43
00:01:52,464 --> 00:01:54,380
I don't think folding
is the end of the world.

44
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,257
I think it's slightly
profitable to play,

45
00:01:56,257 --> 00:01:58,340
but it's not like you're
giving up a ton of equity

46
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,480
by folding this.

47
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,420
So what do we do?

48
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,470
OK, so I'm going to start
out with a bit of theory.

49
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:07,415
So I haven't really
talked about this.

50
00:02:07,415 --> 00:02:11,360
I want to talk a bit about
preflop re-raising theory.

51
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,424
So in this situation,
I don't want

52
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,590
to just talk about what to
do with this hand, right.

53
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,965
This is how
throughout this class

54
00:02:16,965 --> 00:02:18,965
I've been saying we
shouldn't think about poker.

55
00:02:18,965 --> 00:02:21,170
We should always think
about the general situation.

56
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,240
What's the range of
hands we could have?

57
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,010
What's the range of
hands they could have?

58
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:28,100
And how should both players
play their overall strategy

59
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,430
with their entire
range of hands?

60
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:34,150
OK, so there's a few interesting
things to think about here.

61
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,550
So there's sort of a dilemma.

62
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,960
So if we think about
our overall strategy--

63
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:42,580
so first thing you notice is how
many bets deep is it effective.

64
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,210
What's the stack
size effectively?

65
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:47,910
It's about, it's about
28, right, I think.

66
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,910
So yeah, we have about
the same amount of chips.

67
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,740
We have like 28
and 1/2 big blinds.

68
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,176
That's clear to everyone?

69
00:02:53,176 --> 00:02:55,050
So it's important that
it's fairly deep here.

70
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,450
So the stack size, the
effective stack size

71
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,350
is 28 and 1/2 big blinds.

72
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,780
So what's the issue?

73
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,910
It's sometimes in
this spot, we have

74
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,100
a hand that's good
enough implied odds

75
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,510
to play in position.

76
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,377
But it's not really
like a good hand

77
00:03:10,377 --> 00:03:12,710
that we're trying to raise
and make the pot bigger with.

78
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,970
Like an example of this
is like king-jack suited

79
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,440
or like king-queen off, I
think, is a good example, too.

80
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,860
It's a hand that's
good enough to play,

81
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,235
but not a hand
that's good enough

82
00:03:20,235 --> 00:03:24,500
that we'd necessarily want to
raise and make the pot bigger.

83
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,960
On the other hand,
sometimes we have a hand

84
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,720
that you want to raise and hope
you get all-in with, like aces,

85
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,219
right.

86
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:32,720
So we have these sort
of two types of hands

87
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,790
that we want to play
in this situation.

88
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,100
But if we play
according to our hand,

89
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,530
it can become too
predictable, right.

90
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:42,409
So this is like a somewhat
intuitive strategy.

91
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:44,450
So you know, let's suppose
this was our strategy.

92
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,774
Let's suppose our strategy
was with the best hands

93
00:03:46,774 --> 00:03:48,440
that we're hoping to
get an all-in with,

94
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,950
let's say in this spot,
pocket 10s plus and ace-king.

95
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:55,610
I think that's reasonable
as the set of hands

96
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,160
we're willing to and
happy to go all-in with.

97
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,620
So pocket 10s plus,
ace-king, and then

98
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,550
we call with pocket
fives plus, ace-jack off,

99
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:08,760
ace-10 suited, king-queen off.

100
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,240
I'd say this is a
reasonable strategy to play.

101
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,260
But what are some
problems with this sort

102
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,209
of intuitive,
exploitative strategy?

103
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:20,600
Yeah?

104
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,860
AUDIENCE: People are just
going to fold to your aces

105
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,475
and pick up money from you when
you don't have the top hands.

106
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,310
WILL MA: OK, great, yeah, good.

107
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,050
So that's a good point.

108
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:35,619
So basically, if we only
raise with pocket 10s plus,

109
00:04:35,619 --> 00:04:37,160
people could just
fold pretty easily,

110
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,770
because they know that we have
a great hand whenever we raise.

111
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:40,640
Good.

112
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,870
OK, what's another issue?

113
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,570
This one's a bit more subtle.

114
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,289
What's sort of another issue?

115
00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:47,080
So one issue is when
we raise, it's obvious

116
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,620
that we have a great hand.

117
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,830
And so on a similar
line, another-- yeah.

118
00:04:53,417 --> 00:04:54,250
I'm sorry, did you--

119
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,621
AUDIENCE: Yeah, if we call
them, they know we're weaker.

120
00:04:56,621 --> 00:04:57,620
WILL MA: Right, exactly.

121
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,340
OK, good.

122
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,790
So an almost bigger
issue here is

123
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,710
if we play like
this, when we call,

124
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,540
people know we can't have aces.

125
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,090
So you know one of the
guys behind, like this guy,

126
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,220
[? Aight ?] might
just be able to raise.

127
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,660
And they're going to know
we're going to be fairly weak.

128
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,500
And we're going to have
to fold most of the time.

129
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,930
So basically, this is not
a really balanced strategy.

130
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,450
So what can we do?

131
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:24,080
Well, we could raise
some assortment of hands

132
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,120
from the call category
to balance it out.

133
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,390
We could call some hands
from the raise category

134
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:32,240
a small percent of the time,
like play randomized strategy

135
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,580
where you raise
aces 80% of the time

136
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:38,730
and call aces 20% of the
time to balance it out.

137
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,317
There's some other
more extreme things

138
00:05:40,317 --> 00:05:42,650
you can do that I don't think
are good in this situation

139
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:45,560
but are reasonable when the
stack size is different.

140
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,680
So I think if it's shallow or,
let's say, only 20 big blinds

141
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,900
deep, then just
raising all hands,

142
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,470
just raising the top X percent
of hands is a decent strategy,

143
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:58,160
because 20 big blinds is
sort of shallow enough

144
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,710
where if you raise,
you're kind of committing

145
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,210
your whole stack anyway.

146
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:06,230
And if it's deeper, like if
it's 100 big blinds deep,

147
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,810
some players will like to
call 100% of the hands.

148
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,805
They'll just never raise.

149
00:06:10,805 --> 00:06:12,680
I don't think it's like
the optimal strategy,

150
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,470
but it's not an
unreasonable strategy.

151
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:18,230
If you're 100 big blinds
deep, and you have position,

152
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,320
it's not terrible.

153
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,399
And then your range is
completely disguised,

154
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:23,690
because you're playing all
your hands the same preflop.

155
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:28,140
So these are some
reasonable solution ideas.

156
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:32,070
So here's sort of
a better solution.

157
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:36,430
So this will sound really cool
compared to the previous slide,

158
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:41,810
which is instead of raising some
of the call hands as a bluff

159
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,930
essentially to balance
out the times we raise

160
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:46,520
with a good hand, what
if we actually-- we

161
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,510
bluff-raise the best hands that
aren't good enough to call.

162
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,790
So let me just, so we can
look at this again, right.

163
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:55,810
So our strategy was
we're raising for value,

164
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,710
aka we're raising,
hoping to get called

165
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,320
with 10s plus and ace-king.

166
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,820
We're calling with sort of the
pretty good hands like pocket

167
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,750
fives plus, ace-jack, ace-10
suited, king-queen off.

168
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:10,280
And then we're going to
bluff-raise hands that

169
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,760
aren't positive expectancy to
call, so like pocket fours,

170
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,620
ace-10 off, ace-nine
suited, hands

171
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:19,040
that are even weaker than the
call hands, but in some sense,

172
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,350
if we bluff-raise
with these hands,

173
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:24,860
the benefit is we're sort
of not wasting them, right.

174
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,380
Like let's say with
these better hands,

175
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,120
like let's say
with ace-jack off,

176
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,850
I raise, and my
opponent goes all in.

177
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,990
Well, I'm probably
going to have to fold

178
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,140
in this situation for
28 and 1/2 big blinds.

179
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,720
So I sort of like
wasted my ace-jack,

180
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,110
whereas if I did it
with ace-10 instead,

181
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,860
then I get to call with
my ace-jack, which I know

182
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:49,910
is plus EV to call and not waste
such a good hand bluff-raising.

183
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:52,100
So this is a very
important concept in poker.

184
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,950
It's called polarizing.

185
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,620
And in general, you know,
it's a sound strategy, right.

186
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,900
By this wasting
argument, I'm saying,

187
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,700
I'm talking about--
polarizing sounds

188
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,110
like a pretty reasonable
strategy, right.

189
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,526
Because it ensures
that you're not

190
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:10,130
wasting your medium-strength
hands to bluff-raise.

191
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:13,700
So what's an issue with it?

192
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:20,200
It can be exploited if your
opponent calls your three-bet.

193
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,290
So does anyone
actually see, does

194
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,290
anyone actually see, so
let's say, in this case,

195
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,720
suppose this was my strategy.

196
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,860
So I'm raising pocket
10s plus and ace-king.

197
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:37,520
And I'm bluff-raising the
hands that I listed here.

198
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,080
OK, I'll give a $20
gift certificate to you.

199
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,640
So like what's a specific
board, let's say,

200
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,680
where someone can explain
my strategy if this

201
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,805
was my specific strategy?

202
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,830
This is just for illustration.

203
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:54,810
So look at my exact
range, and can someone

204
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:58,025
say sort of what's a very
bad flop for my range?

205
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,330
Yeah.

206
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,756
AUDIENCE: If flop's high
cards, because they'll

207
00:09:06,756 --> 00:09:09,350
be thinking your range
is generally high cards,

208
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:12,830
but those are a bit lower.

209
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:15,040
WILL MA: Right, so if
there's high cards,

210
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,670
but we do have lots
of aces and kings.

211
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:20,090
Like if the flop comes,
like if there's an ace,

212
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,740
then it's pretty
good for our range,

213
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,170
right, even though they
might be able to fold easily,

214
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:27,260
but we're still
going to win the pot.

215
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:30,375
But what is like a specific,
what's a specific issue-- yeah.

216
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,500
AUDIENCE: Well, if five,
six, seven, or in between.

217
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,070
WILL MA: OK, good, so five, six,
seven is kind of bad for us,

218
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:35,570
right.

219
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,590
Because our range
basically contains

220
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,460
no fives, no sixes, no sevens.

221
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,700
But even five, six, seven, we
still have like a bigger pair

222
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,600
quite often.

223
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,110
So what's like an
even worse case?

224
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:46,980
Yeah.

225
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,297
AUDIENCE: High flush draw
or a high straight draw.

226
00:09:50,297 --> 00:09:52,130
WILL MA: Yeah, but we
can have those, right.

227
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,640
We have ace-nine
suit in our range.

228
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,240
We got king-10
suited in our range.

229
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,550
AUDIENCE: So then like a low
pair, like four-four or eight.

230
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,670
WILL MA: Yeah, we don't
have fours or eights,

231
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,520
but you know on those
boards, like pocket jacks,

232
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,110
even like ace-king high is a
pretty good hand and pocket

233
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:08,634
jacks.

234
00:10:08,634 --> 00:10:10,550
There's something very
specific we're missing.

235
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:14,140
I mean this is just for
this example, but yeah.

236
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,009
AUDIENCE: Maybe
a pair of queens.

237
00:10:16,009 --> 00:10:17,050
WILL MA: Right, OK, good.

238
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,758
So that's sort of what
I was looking for.

239
00:10:18,758 --> 00:10:20,740
You can come get
this now if you want.

240
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,660
Essentially, suppose this
was our exact strategy.

241
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:27,640
If the board comes queen
high, then essentially they

242
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,400
know that our range is pretty
bad, because we don't ever

243
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,080
have a queen.

244
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,120
I mean we could
have kings or aces,

245
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,350
but all of our other pairs are
going to be smaller than queen.

246
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,610
So I mean this is just
a specific example,

247
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,962
but I'm saying polarizing
is, in general,

248
00:10:43,962 --> 00:10:45,920
a good concept by this
argument that you're not

249
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,870
wasting your good hands.

250
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:50,810
But it can be exploited
if your opponent knows

251
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:53,300
the specific way in
which you're polarizing,

252
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,029
and they just call your
reraise and see the flop.

253
00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:58,070
And they'll be able to
play very well on the flop

254
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:02,510
still, even if you have some
good hands and some bluffs.

255
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:05,290
It can also be bad against
unpredictable opponents,

256
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:09,860
because by the ace-jack,
ace-10 argument again,

257
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,060
let's say you
three-bet with ace-10

258
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,429
instead of ace-jack as
an attempt to polarize.

259
00:11:14,429 --> 00:11:16,220
But let's say your
opponent is kind of bad,

260
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:20,990
and they might make a loose call
in this situation with ace-10.

261
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,680
Then you would have
really hoped to have

262
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,550
ace-jack instead of
ace-10 if they're going

263
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:28,190
to call your raise with ace-10.

264
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,140
So if you're
polarizing, you're sort

265
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:33,000
of assuming your opponent
is going to play reasonably.

266
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,330
So the point is the
reason why I don't

267
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,460
want to sort of waste
ace-jack by raising

268
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,920
is because my opponent's
probably going to fold ace-10.

269
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,600
But what if they
might call ace-10?

270
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,669
Then I really would have wished
I reraised with ace-jack.

271
00:11:46,669 --> 00:11:48,210
OK, the short answer
is I'm not going

272
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:51,620
to give a conclusive formula
on how to play this situation,

273
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,750
because the short answer
is it's complicated.

274
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,150
And I don't think anyone
essentially knows what

275
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,520
the optimal strategy is yet.

276
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,620
But in practice, I think
just raising a mix of hands

277
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,880
from the call category,
mostly the off-suit hands

278
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,180
which have worse
implied odds, is

279
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:11,180
pretty good as part of
your bluff-raising range.

280
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,830
And calling the best hands
from the raise category,

281
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:16,640
like aces, like trapping a
small percent of the time,

282
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,210
just calling aces maybe
a fifth of the time,

283
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:21,750
so that sometimes you
have it when you call,

284
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:25,670
so that people can't just
reraise when you call.

285
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,584
And also raise some
of the best hands

286
00:12:27,584 --> 00:12:28,750
that aren't plus EV to call.

287
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,200
So polarize a bit.

288
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,034
Essentially, the short
answer is it's complicated.

289
00:12:34,034 --> 00:12:35,450
You need to do a
bit of everything

290
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,280
with all sorts of hands.

291
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,700
But I just wanted to sort of
talk about how complicated

292
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,560
this situation can be.

293
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,290
All right, so OK, so let's
get back to the hand.

294
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:48,360
So what I decided to
do here was following

295
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,910
the thing I said about
reraising with off-suit hands,

296
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:57,050
I decided to, so I decided
to raise here to 555.

297
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:59,910
And so I think this is
about the right sizing,

298
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:03,110
because we're making it
about 2.5 times his raise.

299
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,000
And essentially
we're bluffing here.

300
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,380
And our hand is
good enough where

301
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,270
it's not the end of
the world if they call,

302
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:11,540
because we have a lot of
chances to hit top pair.

303
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,250
And if we do, we're
probably good,

304
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,440
because they're
probably going all in

305
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,330
with ace-king or
ace-queen preflop.

306
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,990
But essentially we're bluffing.

307
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:22,700
I'm definitely hoping
he folds, and he does.

308
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,020
So OK, we take down the pot.

309
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,370
OK so the very next
hand, I actually

310
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:32,164
just noticed this
during, when I was

311
00:13:32,164 --> 00:13:33,330
replaying through the hands.

312
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,070
So I didn't notice this.

313
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:38,610
I didn't notice this during
the tournament actually.

314
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,260
So what do you notice?

315
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,484
We're actually in the exact
same situation again, right.

316
00:13:43,484 --> 00:13:44,650
But we have different cards.

317
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:46,941
So it's good that we thought
about our overall strategy

318
00:13:46,941 --> 00:13:48,540
when we played that
hand, because you

319
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,130
will end up in
the same situation

320
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,380
again with different cards.

321
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,900
OK, so along the same lines--

322
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,270
but at the time I was probably
playing like 15 tables or more.

323
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:01,245
So I wasn't really
paying attention.

324
00:14:01,245 --> 00:14:03,495
I probably didn't remember
that I reraised my opponent

325
00:14:03,495 --> 00:14:04,710
the hand before.

326
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,650
But playing through
this, it actually yielded

327
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:10,440
a really good result.
Because what happened was

328
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,560
they didn't believe my three-bet
the second time around,

329
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,740
and they went all in
with pocket sevens.

330
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,960
It's not a terrible hand,
but it's definitely,

331
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,551
I think, a weaker hand than they
would usually go all in there

332
00:14:21,551 --> 00:14:22,050
with.

333
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:24,630
But I guess they didn't
believe my reraise

334
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,070
after the previous hand.

335
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:29,010
So this also sort of
illustrates the importance

336
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:32,650
of like you said, of sometimes
having a bad hand when

337
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,830
you reraise, so that
people will give you

338
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:37,330
action when you do have a
good hand like pocket jacks.

339
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,290
OK, so let's go on.

340
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:44,880
I'm only playing
through the hands

341
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,410
that I essentially played at
the start of the tournament.

342
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,130
So we doubled up.

343
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,540
The starting stack was 3,000.

344
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,340
We've got 6,000 now.

345
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:58,530
We get ace-queen, we raise,
and we get called here.

346
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,260
And here, this guy makes it--
so this is a different player,

347
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,600
because we eliminated the
guy who used to sit here.

348
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,870
And they make it 755.

349
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:07,990
I decide to fold here.

350
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,700
I think ace-queen offsuit
is just a bit too weak.

351
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,080
I think going all in is--

352
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,580
it wouldn't be
terrible, but I think

353
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,910
when we raised from
fairly early position,

354
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,260
under-the-gun plus one.

355
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,660
And this high jack called.

356
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,550
They're not going to be doing
this as a bluff very often.

357
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:28,380
And their reraise to 755 I
think usually commits them.

358
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:32,560
It's not guaranteed that they're
going to go all in if we--

359
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,420
they're going to call
us if we go all in.

360
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,000
But I think most
likely they will,

361
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,500
and they're going to
be ahead of our range.

362
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,160
So I decide to fold.

363
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,470
It's a fairly tight fold.

364
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:44,195
So it is a stack.

365
00:15:44,195 --> 00:15:46,320
I'm just going to continue
playing through my hands

366
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,153
from the tournament.

367
00:15:47,153 --> 00:15:51,822
If you have any questions,
just stop me and ask.

368
00:15:51,822 --> 00:15:53,780
So this is sort of a
weird hand, and I actually

369
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,640
think I played this
hand quite terribly.

370
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,270
So this guy calls, which
I said we should never do,

371
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,150
but I guess he
doesn't take my class.

372
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,270
We get queen-10 here.

373
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,460
We check, we see a flop.

374
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,490
So we flop two over cards,
a backdoor flush draw

375
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:13,640
and a gutter straight draw.

376
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,570
So I decide to lead into it,
sort of lead my draws out,

377
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:18,920
hope he folds.

378
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,490
He calls, and the
turn is a three.

379
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,980
And then here, so this
is where I sort of,

380
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,390
he decided he suffered at me.

381
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,570
So I talked about how he
should only be doing this

382
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,690
if he doesn't respect me.

383
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:32,390
Because I mean in
this case, it's

384
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:35,050
not a completely insignificant
fraction of the pot.

385
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,290
It's like one sixth.

386
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:39,350
So he is actually getting
some substantial payment

387
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,460
into the pot, but it's
still fairly small.

388
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,490
And the main thing it
does is it gives me

389
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,400
an opportunity to check-raise.

390
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,820
But I'm not going to.

391
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,020
I don't think they're
going to fold often enough.

392
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,580
There's a lot of draws
they're going to call me with,

393
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,663
and I'm going to have to
bluff again on the river.

394
00:16:52,663 --> 00:16:55,807
So I decide to just call,
which is reasonable.

395
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,890
So this is where I think
I played the hand poorly.

396
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:00,470
So the river completes
a lot of draws,

397
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:03,130
but it doesn't complete my hand.

398
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,730
And I just check it down.

399
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:07,430
I just check it,
which at the time

400
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:11,329
I didn't lead out, because
I thought the fact that I

401
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:13,220
only called the turn
and suddenly decided

402
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,680
to bet big on the river
would probably get called.

403
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,319
But I think it's just not a
balanced way to play the hand,

404
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,170
because plenty of times
I will have clubs,

405
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,300
or I'll have jack-10
or something.

406
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,819
I'll have a jack, and I
will want to bet for value.

407
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:28,040
And here when I have a
hand that essentially

408
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,010
has no chance of winning
the hand at showdown.

409
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:33,320
Like essentially, I'm
giving up the pot for sure

410
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,930
if I check, because my queen
high will never be good.

411
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,700
I should definitely be bluffing.

412
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,580
So I didn't, which I regret,
because I let him take down

413
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:44,220
the pot with a pair of threes.

414
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,220
Yeah, I guess he kind of
played that hand well.

415
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,440
He called eight-three suited.

416
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,810
I guess he made money from
me, because I didn't play

417
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:53,760
very well from the big blind.

418
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,610
OK so the next hand, we
get king-jack offsuit here.

419
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,710
We open, probably one
of the weakest hands

420
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,180
I'm opening from this position.

421
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,944
I think probably in
my recommendations,

422
00:18:03,944 --> 00:18:05,360
this is not in the
list you should

423
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,930
open from, high jack minus one.

424
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:11,390
But I decide to open,
because I'm bored I guess.

425
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:15,250
And we get three callers.

426
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:19,190
OK, so the flop is four,
six, four with two hearts.

427
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:21,200
So I decide to
continuation bet here.

428
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,000
I think it's a
fairly marginal spot.

429
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,400
I think just giving up is OK.

430
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,390
I definitely wouldn't
have stabbed at the pot

431
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,520
if I didn't have
the King of Hearts.

432
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,820
But the fact that I have a
backdoor pretty good flush

433
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:38,840
draw, I decided to bet and
just hope that everyone folds.

434
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,960
And we do get that
which is pretty nice.

435
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:48,167
OK, so you know our stack is
hovering around the same size.

436
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:49,750
We won some hands
and lost some hands.

437
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,310
It's still early
in the tournament.

438
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,830
The blinds have gone up a
bit, but it's still far away

439
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:56,560
from the payouts.

440
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,240
OK, so we get we
queen-jack on the button.

441
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,705
And this guy just goes
all in for a lot of bets.

442
00:19:04,705 --> 00:19:05,830
I guess it's not that many.

443
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:08,350
It's like 35.

444
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:11,770
No, sorry, it's-- yeah, it's
it's about 30, 35 right.

445
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:16,540
So I fold here obviously.

446
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,940
But I thought a bit
about his range,

447
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:23,310
and you know it's possible
his range is like entirely--

448
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,390
so I talked about this
in a previous class.

449
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:28,900
When do you want to be going
all in for a huge size?

450
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:32,260
It's essentially what hands
that are pretty good to get all

451
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:36,550
in with preflop but have
terrible post-flop implied odds

452
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,730
in this situation.

453
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:40,200
And what were the
hands I listed there?

454
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,510
It's essentially small
pairs, like pocket twos,

455
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,020
you really don't
want to see a flop.

456
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,427
It's quite a good hand
preflop but you really

457
00:19:47,427 --> 00:19:49,510
don't want to see a flop,
because it's pretty much

458
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,340
always three higher
cards are going to come,

459
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,631
and you're just going to be
playing this guessing game,

460
00:19:53,631 --> 00:19:55,690
trying to guess whether
your opponent has a pair.

461
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:59,230
And the other type of hand
is like ace-two offsuit

462
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:03,135
where once again, you have an
ace preflop which is decent.

463
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:05,260
But you're just going to
be playing a guessing game

464
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,280
on most flops.

465
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:10,180
So you know probably if I had
a very strong read on him,

466
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:13,300
and if I had
jack-10 suited here,

467
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,030
calling is maybe not that bad,
because you're like a coin

468
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,650
flip against ace-two offsuit.

469
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,560
And you're like 54% favored
against pocket threes.

470
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,462
So I folded here, because
my hand isn't suited,

471
00:20:23,462 --> 00:20:25,420
and just because there's
a small chance they're

472
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,420
going to have ace-queen.

473
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,640
And my read was nowhere
near strong enough

474
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,500
to conclude that for sure.

475
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,645
There range was only
small pairs and a six.

476
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,770
OK, so we lose a bit of chips.

477
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,630
We're blinding down a bit.

478
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:44,450
Here we get 10-2 suited, so I
call from the big blind with 4

479
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,372
and 1/2 to 1 odds.

480
00:20:45,372 --> 00:20:47,830
I think this is probably one
of the weakest hands I'd call.

481
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,572
I might not call eight-two
suited although it's close.

482
00:20:50,572 --> 00:20:53,030
I mean, you could make a case
for calling eight-two suited.

483
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:55,700
So once again, my
odds were really good,

484
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:59,800
but the reverse implied odds
do sort of work against me

485
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,080
quite a bit since I'm going
to be out of position,

486
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,240
and I have small cards
which will usually

487
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,480
make a smaller pair than them.

488
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,520
But I decide to call, and
we flopped a flush draw,

489
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,820
which is pretty good.

490
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,030
But I'm still going
to check, because this

491
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,820
is a board where I'm just going
to check to the pre-flop raiser

492
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,710
and let them continuation bet.

493
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,320
So I talked about leading
in an earlier class,

494
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,440
and I don't think
this is a board where

495
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,780
we should be leading.

496
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,340
I think never leading
is OK as well, so.

497
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,830
I decide to check,
and they check back.

498
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,700
So we turn the flush,
which is great.

499
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,760
We bet 600 into 1080.

500
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,210
So unfortunately, we
don't get any action.

501
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,080
So we take it down.

502
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,730
So for the next--

503
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:51,220
I think this is one
more a bit later.

504
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,400
So under-the-gun raises,
small blind queue

505
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,640
is very, very short.

506
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,430
He only has 7 and
1/2 big blind calls.

507
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:01,530
And we decide to
call with our 7--

508
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:07,400
with our 6 and 1/2 to one
odds here, or six to one odds.

509
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,010
So we flop queen, jack, five.

510
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:12,650
So we have second pair with
a backdoor straight draw

511
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:14,900
and a backdoor flush draw.

512
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:20,360
And the small blind goes
all in for 1054 into 1380.

513
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,030
So this is sort of I
think a pretty close spot.

514
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:26,850
I think if I knew for
sure that Arden1977

515
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:30,360
didn't have a hand here, I think
calling is definitely fine.

516
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:34,220
We're given about
2.3 to one odds.

517
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,680
And I think second pair
with these backdoor

518
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,114
draws is more than good
enough against his range.

519
00:22:40,114 --> 00:22:41,780
Because I think his
range will mostly be

520
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:46,050
draws and top pairs and second
pairs, probably not bottom pair

521
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:48,920
that often, because
they did call preflop

522
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,680
from the small blind,
which I don't expect

523
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,010
most players would do with a
hand like seven-five suited.

524
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:58,310
So we're not even that happy
to call him to be honest,

525
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,500
but I probably would call.

526
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,320
But the fact that this
guy here is behind,

527
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,490
and they could raise,
or they could call,

528
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:07,880
and we'd have to make more
decisions on future streets,

529
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,170
I think really hurts us.

530
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:12,330
And I think we
should have folded.

531
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:15,137
At the time I decided to call.

532
00:23:15,137 --> 00:23:17,470
I don't know why, but I don't
think this is a good play.

533
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:20,090
I think it's just too
risky essentially.

534
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:22,700
It'll work most of the time.

535
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,200
Because most of the
time [? Arton ?]

536
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,570
will fold, because
they're going to see

537
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,960
two players putting money in.

538
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,180
But the times where
they do have something,

539
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:32,300
I'm going to have to fold,
and it's going to suck.

540
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,630
So we do call.

541
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:36,140
They actually had
the same hand as us.

542
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,532
It worked out well.

543
00:23:37,532 --> 00:23:38,990
I guess we sort of
took a bad beat,

544
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:41,570
because we could've made a
flush, and they couldn't have.

545
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:45,640
We were technically ahead,
but we get half the pot.

546
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,620
So I'm not going through
my tournament history

547
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:57,820
from one month ago and saying
I played every hand perfectly.

548
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,710
When I look through
here, I definitely--

549
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,496
there's a lot of mistakes.

550
00:24:01,496 --> 00:24:03,370
There's a lot of hands
I wish I could replay.

551
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:10,540
So this hand, I guess,
is fairly simple.

552
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,360
So we have ace-king, and I think
it's definitely good enough

553
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,980
to get it all in here with.

554
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:18,107
So as far as what my
range is I think--

555
00:24:18,107 --> 00:24:22,112
[INAUDIBLE] I think-- sorry.

556
00:24:22,112 --> 00:24:23,320
Did you have a suggestion or?

557
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,780
AUDIENCE: Oh, no, no, I
just saw this guy's handle,

558
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,615
and I thought it was funny.

559
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,132
OK, so you thought it was who?

560
00:24:36,132 --> 00:24:38,340
AUDIENCE: Funny.

561
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,590
WILL MA: Sorry, sorry.

562
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,560
OK.

563
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,440
No, yeah, don't ask
me what my hand means.

564
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,370
My handle is--

565
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:45,550
AUDIENCE: What does it mean?

566
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,631
[LAUGHTER]

567
00:24:47,631 --> 00:24:48,880
WILL MA: I can't even read it.

568
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,050
I think it stood for something.

569
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:56,790
I probably made it
when I was like 17,

570
00:24:56,790 --> 00:25:00,170
and I think it
stood for something.

571
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:04,550
I probably don't remember
what it stands for, OK.

572
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:05,909
So we go all in here.

573
00:25:05,909 --> 00:25:07,450
So this is sort of
a no-brainer hand,

574
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:10,620
but let's stop and think a bit
about what our range should be.

575
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:14,100
So I think with ace-king,
ace-king and pocket tens,

576
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,050
I think it's fairly
easy get it all in.

577
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:20,660
I think with ace-queen
suited, I would get it in.

578
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:24,460
I think if I had ace-queen
offsuit, I would probably fold.

579
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:29,120
Although with ace-queen suited
actually if this Jet Ski Fun

580
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,810
guy had as many chips as us,
then maybe I would have folded.

581
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:36,060
But the fact that we're
actually not risking

582
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:40,650
our entire 6250 against the
two players who are in the pot

583
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:41,700
is very relevant.

584
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,310
Because [? Armond ?] covers
us, and they could in theory

585
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,330
pick up pocket aces.

586
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:47,490
But it's much less
likely for them

587
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:50,280
to pick up pocket aces
than this Jet Ski Fun

588
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,602
guy who's already in the pot.

589
00:25:51,602 --> 00:25:53,310
So the fact that they
may have [? SEAM ?]

590
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:56,550
less than 20 big blinds as
well helps our case a lot.

591
00:25:56,550 --> 00:26:00,450
So I would probably get it
in with ace-queen suited plus

592
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:03,300
and then pocket
nines plus, probably,

593
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,510
is what I would get
it in with here.

594
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:14,340
So we go all in, and we beat
ace-jack, which is good.

595
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:17,445
So I think ace-jack is
slightly on the loose side.

596
00:26:17,445 --> 00:26:19,820
I mean, I think it's a fine
play definitely to get it all

597
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:23,457
in with ace-jack, but
maybe they could have--

598
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:25,540
because they do have more
than 20 big blinds here.

599
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:28,220
So I think maybe they could have
considered calling or raising

600
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:31,340
small and folding if someone
like us entered the pot.

601
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,860
But nonetheless, I think
they played their hand fine.

602
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:39,680
OK, so the next hand
we have a pocket nines.

603
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,664
So [? Manny, ?]
this guy, raises.

604
00:26:41,664 --> 00:26:44,080
So we're getting deeper now,
because we won the last hand.

605
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,560
So now we've got, we've got
40 big blinds, and we call.

606
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,530
This guy also calls
and [? Liamkid ?]

607
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:55,580
goes all in for 30 big blinds.

608
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,290
So they get out of the way.

609
00:26:57,290 --> 00:27:00,540
I think this is actually
a very close spot.

610
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:03,640
I do think one big
incentive to get

611
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,990
it all in is I
think it's not that

612
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:09,039
likely that [? Liamkid ?] has
pocket kings or pocket aces.

613
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,580
Because I think
there's a good chance

614
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:14,220
they would just raised smaller,
maybe, to try to sucker people

615
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:14,720
in.

616
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,850
So I actually think I'm not
losing to too much here.

617
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:20,150
And same with [? Armond. ?]
I think it's also very hard

618
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:21,691
for [? Armond ?] to
have a good hand.

619
00:27:21,691 --> 00:27:23,510
So even though in
the first example,

620
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:28,040
we talked about how sometimes
calling with pocket aces

621
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,349
here is a good play, but you
know, I said if one guy raised,

622
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:33,140
and you're the second
guy, you should maybe

623
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,840
call with pocket aces
like 20% of the time.

624
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,880
When it's two guys who have--

625
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:41,330
like when it's one guy who
has raise, me who has called,

626
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:44,570
and now you're deciding
what to do with pocket aces.

627
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:47,870
Instead of 20% you should be
calling, it's literally like,

628
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:51,350
maybe like 2% or 1% we should
be calling with pocket aces.

629
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:54,770
So if you multiply
1% by the probability

630
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:58,130
of getting dealt pocket aces,
which is around one in 200,

631
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:00,590
it's literally like
one out of 20,000

632
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:02,320
that he has pocket aces here.

633
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,000
So I'm not too afraid of him.

634
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,380
So I really think
getting it in is fine.

635
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,910
But at the same time, I don't
think I'm ever a favorite here.

636
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:13,640
I think their range is
essentially ace-king,

637
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:17,570
ace-queen, maybe ace-jack
suited, and then, essentially,

638
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:20,720
pocket 10s, pocket nines,
pocket jacks, pocket queens,

639
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,370
maybe occasionally
pocket eights.

640
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:25,070
So I could have done an
exact equity calculation

641
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,229
on PokerStove.

642
00:28:26,229 --> 00:28:28,520
If I did, it probably would
have been very, very close.

643
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:32,080
But I decided to fold, and
they take down the pot.

644
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:39,770
OK, so the next hand
we get a ace-jack.

645
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:41,320
We raise from under-the-gun.

646
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:45,150
This guy goes all in
for six big blinds.

647
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,650
We're basically
committed here, even

648
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:48,870
if we think he's crushing us.

649
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:52,350
So I call, and we
lose to ace-king.

650
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:54,960
Not really too much
we can do here.

651
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,930
Although this does
illustrate one concept, which

652
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:01,280
is when there are stacks
behind like [? Zarbizan ?] who

653
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,410
are short enough that they can
commit you by going all in,

654
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,930
you should be slightly
less incentivized to open

655
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:08,040
speculative hands here.

656
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,520
Like say I had 10-nine suited,
I think while normally I

657
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,450
would consider opening 10-nine
suited here as a steal.

658
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:18,540
It's a huge disincentive to
steal here with 10-nine suited

659
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,520
when someone like
[? Zarbizan ?] can just

660
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,640
pick up even a hand as
weak as ace-jack suited

661
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,430
or ace-jack offsuit and go all
and beat our 10-nine suited.

662
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:31,800
But ace-jack is more than good
enough to still raise here.

663
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,910
We unfortunately
run into ace-king.

664
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,210
Next hand we get ace-jack again.

665
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:46,800
The same guy who just doubled
up through us goes all in,

666
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,900
and here I call him.

667
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,810
Because even though
there's more chips,

668
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:54,760
the positions are a lot
later, and specifically,

669
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,676
they went all in for
14 big blinds when

670
00:29:57,676 --> 00:29:58,800
no one else was in the pot.

671
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:02,580
So their range is, their
range isn't super duper wide,

672
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:06,120
but it's definitely wide
enough that ace-jack I'm

673
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,160
happy to call here.

674
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:12,150
As far as what my
range is, I think

675
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:13,650
I wouldn't call
with ace-10 offsuit,

676
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:15,270
but I would call
with ace-10 suited.

677
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:18,650
So probably ace-10
suited, and I think

678
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,360
I'd call with king-queen suited
but not king-queen offsuit.

679
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,820
And the smallest
pair I get it in with

680
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:31,092
is probably pocket sixes, I
think, maybe pocket five is OK.

681
00:30:31,092 --> 00:30:32,800
Yeah, probably pocket
fives is too loose,

682
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,716
probably pocket sixes.

683
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,300
So we call.

684
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,160
So unfortunately, we
lose to king-10 suited.

685
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,110
So he doubles up
through us again,

686
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:44,845
and we're kind of short now.

687
00:30:44,845 --> 00:30:46,210
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

688
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:49,120
On that last hand, why
go all in yourself?

689
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,641
Why not just call his all in?

690
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:51,890
WILL MA: Oh OK, good question.

691
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:54,020
So yeah, this is
a good question.

692
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,020
So in this case, the
two plays I'd say

693
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,300
are fairly close to equivalent.

694
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,130
Because OK, so what's
the defense, right?

695
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:02,170
They're going to be
the same almost always,

696
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:05,384
because Check Raise
is just going to fold.

697
00:31:05,384 --> 00:31:07,030
[LAUGHTER]

698
00:31:08,009 --> 00:31:09,050
So what's the difference?

699
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,930
The difference is if
we don't go all in,

700
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:13,810
then Check Raise let's say,
he picks up aces, right.

701
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:16,570
Then he can just go all in, and
we're basically forced to call

702
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:17,620
him, because we can't--

703
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:22,480
if we put in 4,118,
and they go all in,

704
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,240
we can't really fold
for only 3,000 more.

705
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,060
We can't really fold preflop
with four to one odds.

706
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,350
AUDIENCE: Would that change
if you're the big stack?

707
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:31,720
If like, you had the Check Raise
stack, and he had your stack?

708
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,500
WILL MA: Oh yeah, for sure.

709
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,791
Yeah, that's a very good point.

710
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:34,490
Yeah, for sure.

711
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:37,450
So if we had the same
stack as Check Raise here,

712
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:38,650
I would just call.

713
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:41,436
And then if Check Raise goes
all in, I would probably fold.

714
00:31:41,436 --> 00:31:43,810
But I mean, I'm also going to
call here with pocket aces,

715
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:47,050
so they can't just look down
at pocket twos and go all in

716
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:48,440
and bully me around.

717
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,440
So my strategy if
we had their stack

718
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:55,630
would be to call my entire
range that I plan on playing.

719
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:57,940
But in this case, the
only thing calling does

720
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,330
is it gives him more options.

721
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:02,200
Like let's say they had a
very marginal situation,

722
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,090
like let's say they
had king-queen suited.

723
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:06,970
I think if I only
called, they could maybe

724
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:09,580
argue for calling themselves
with king-queen suited

725
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,630
and seeing a flop.

726
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:12,550
Whereas if I go all in,
I think they're forced

727
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:13,200
to fold king-queen suited.

728
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:13,990
AUDIENCE: Basically,
you have a better chance

729
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:15,242
at making him fold.

730
00:32:15,242 --> 00:32:15,950
WILL MA: Exactly.

731
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,370
I'm just giving
him fewer options.

732
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:18,700
But it's very, very marginal.

733
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,810
It affects it basically
specifically for me

734
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:25,090
the king-queen suited, like it
effects basically for one hand

735
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:27,040
or maybe like two
or three hands.

736
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:32,110
But you might as well
minimize the options

737
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:35,410
you give your opponent.

738
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:38,940
Yeah, like I'd say the
minimum stack size I would

739
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:44,910
need before I call instead
of go all in with is maybe,

740
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:47,100
I think maybe like 13,000.

741
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,530
I think at 13,000,
it's sort of more

742
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:51,835
than I want to risk
against the pot.

743
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:57,760
So now we're kind of short.

744
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,030
So we blind out for a bit.

745
00:32:59,030 --> 00:32:59,986
We don't get cards.

746
00:32:59,986 --> 00:33:01,860
And when you don't get
cards in a tournament,

747
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:05,260
there's not really much you
can do other than blind down,

748
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:08,390
not just go all in with
crap and just lose.

749
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:10,100
So we blind down
for a bit, but we're

750
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,467
fortunate to pick up kings.

751
00:33:11,467 --> 00:33:12,800
So this is sort of a no-brainer.

752
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,380
We go all in.

753
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,130
There's no point
trapping, because they're

754
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:16,780
guaranteed to call us.

755
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:19,910
And we get called by ace-five,
and we win, which is good.

756
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:27,230
The next hand we get
eight-seven offsuit,

757
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:31,160
and against a button raise,
I think calling is fine.

758
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,340
I think their range is just
going to be wide enough, where

759
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:36,620
even though the reverse
implied odds, once again,

760
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,390
really don't work in
our favor, we just

761
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:41,630
have to sort of realize
the equity from 4 and 1/2

762
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:45,450
to 1 odds, so I'm going to call.

763
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:46,630
So we flop nothing.

764
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:48,810
I'm planning to just check-fold.

765
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:49,440
So I check.

766
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,970
They check back.

767
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:51,840
The turn's a four.

768
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,430
Once again, we have nothing.

769
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:56,250
I could bluff here, but
I figure I'm not really

770
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,050
looking to make a big
bluff with this hand,

771
00:33:58,050 --> 00:33:59,720
because I have no draw, no pair.

772
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,500
There's no point.

773
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,000
But I will probably look to
make a bluff on the river

774
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,090
if they also check,
just because whenever

775
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:10,830
you have no chance of winning
the pot and it's the river,

776
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:13,071
then making a bluff
is not unreasonable.

777
00:34:13,071 --> 00:34:14,820
But in this case,
bluffing is kind of bad,

778
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:17,659
because with any club,
they might just call me.

779
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:21,400
Because any club is going
to have some equity.

780
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,150
So I check.

781
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,114
They check back.

782
00:34:23,114 --> 00:34:25,030
The river is a fourth
club, which is, I think,

783
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,590
a pretty good card for me.

784
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:29,800
Because I can easily represent
a small club, and if I did

785
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,179
have a small club, I am
definitely value betting.

786
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:34,389
So it's a pretty good
card for me to bluff,

787
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:38,130
and they're probably going
to have to fold king high.

788
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:40,480
So I bet, and I don't
think I bet fairly big.

789
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,650
I'm just looking
for a size where

790
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,420
they have to fold
sometimes, and they'll

791
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:49,659
have to pay me off sometimes
when I have a small club.

792
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:54,010
So they raised me here,
which is pretty weird.

793
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:57,540
I still don't really have a good
idea of what I think he has.

794
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:00,110
I mean I'm certain
they have me beat.

795
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:02,679
You know so I just fold.

796
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:04,720
We could think a bit about
doing something crazy,

797
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,210
like go all in, but it
would just be weird.

798
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:08,640
I think it's unnecessary.

799
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,840
We've got nothing.

800
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,697
So I just fold.

801
00:35:10,697 --> 00:35:11,530
I don't really know.

802
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:13,750
Maybe they just had like
a slow played flush.

803
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:16,090
It's possible they had like
a king high flush here.

804
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:18,460
And they slow-played the flop.

805
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,830
They decided to
slow-play the turn again,

806
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:24,370
because the turn sort
of didn't hit anybody.

807
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:25,990
Yeah, I'm not sure.

808
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,460
So I fold here.

809
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,800
I mean, it's possible
they just had a high club.

810
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,510
But I feel like
with a high club,

811
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:33,820
they should have
bet at some point,

812
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:37,840
just because a good flush
draw is just as enough equity.

813
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:41,170
But nonetheless, I
guess we'll never know.

814
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:42,420
That's one benefit of calling.

815
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:46,030
You get to find out
what your opponent had.

816
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:47,980
So the next hand,
we have queen-jack.

817
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,070
We've got 12 bets.

818
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:49,870
I just go all in.

819
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:52,420
12 is around the cut
off, like I said,

820
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:55,270
12 is sort of the cutoff where
if you have 12 bets or less,

821
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:57,620
instead of raising,
just go all in.

822
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,680
And that's what we do.

823
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,390
So we get called, but--

824
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:03,180
so this is actually
a pretty sick board.

825
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,710
Yeah, so they
flopped a full house,

826
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:06,704
but we rivered a
higher full house.

827
00:36:06,704 --> 00:36:07,970
[LAUGHTER]

828
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:10,360
Yeah, it's sort of a
waste, because normally

829
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,570
if this happens, you can win
like 100 big blinds from them

830
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:14,500
probably.

831
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:18,700
But instead we only won
how many, eight big blinds.

832
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,280
So it's sort of a
waste but whatever.

833
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:28,250
OK so the next hand,
I got pocket fives,

834
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:33,330
and we raise to a thousand.

835
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:35,440
And [? Liamkid ?]
goes all in again.

836
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:40,000
And you know, it's irritating,
but once again, I have to fold.

837
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,890
I think I just--

838
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:44,290
I don't have enough equity
to call, given his range.

839
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:46,980
Once again it's a situation
where it's a fairly big all in.

840
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:50,190
So I could maybe not
put them on aces,

841
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:52,360
although given that
they've done this once,

842
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,870
they're more likely to just do
this with their entire range

843
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:56,820
and play a strategy
where they're just

844
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,110
going on preflop a lot.

845
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:00,240
So maybe they could have
aces in their range,

846
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,260
but nonetheless, regardless, I
think it's not even that close.

847
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,950
I just fold.

848
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:07,440
Yeah, we don't really want
to call in frustration,

849
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,960
because you saw what happened
to the guy with pocket sevens

850
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:14,739
when he ran into our pocket
jacks in the earlier hand.

851
00:37:14,739 --> 00:37:16,280
OK, so I'll take a
short break there.

852
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,740
And then I'll finish up
the rest of the hands

853
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:19,970
in like two minutes.

854
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,210
OK, so I'm going to get started.

855
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:33,965
The next hand we get
we king-eight offsuit.

856
00:37:33,965 --> 00:37:36,110
And once again, it's one
of these situations where

857
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:38,240
we're not thrilled
to be calling,

858
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,850
especially now that our
odds are even a bit worse,

859
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:43,640
because they actually made it
2.25x, actually a bit more,

860
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:47,360
like 2.35x instead of 2x.

861
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,660
So against Degenerated,
but king-eight offsuit, two

862
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:54,370
big cards, I think, with when
we're sort of not that deep,

863
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:58,610
the reverse implied odds don't
work against us that much,

864
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,590
so we call.

865
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,710
And we get a good preflop.

866
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:03,650
[LAUGHTER]

867
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:07,130
So we check, because once again,
I'm checking my entire range.

868
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:09,440
That's how I choose
to play my strategy.

869
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,570
And they bet.

870
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:14,690
And so this sort
of, I think this

871
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:20,750
is a somewhat close situation,
because there are some draws.

872
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,250
There is a flush
draw, and there are

873
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:23,750
a bunch of straight
draws if someone

874
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:26,330
has jack-10 or
queen-jack or queen-10.

875
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:28,490
So I do think there is a
decent amount of incentive

876
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:29,870
to just check-raise all in.

877
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:31,550
So on the second
lecture, I showed you

878
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:34,560
a bunch of examples where
on boards like this,

879
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,920
you can check-raise all
in with your good hands

880
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,870
and check-raise all
in with your draws,

881
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:41,210
and it's a pretty
balanced strategy.

882
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:44,010
Because when you have a good
hand, you have a good hand.

883
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:45,635
And when you have a
draw, you have lots

884
00:38:45,635 --> 00:38:47,960
of outs when you get called.

885
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,610
And another advantage
of going all in is--

886
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:54,680
let's say I had like
10-nine, I would probably

887
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,510
want to be raising.

888
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:57,260
Because with 10-nine,
even though we

889
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:00,500
have a pretty good hand, we sort
of want to protect our hand.

890
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,190
We don't really want a
jack or queen or an ace

891
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,590
to come that much.

892
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:08,210
So it's close, but in the
end, I decided to call.

893
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:10,490
And I think I decided
I'm just going

894
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:14,420
to play pretty close, pretty
much my entire strategy,

895
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,890
I'm just going to call here.

896
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:21,320
As tempting as it is, like let's
say I had ace, Two of Diamonds,

897
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,530
or let's say like queen, Six of
Diamonds to check-raise all in,

898
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:27,140
I think it's a board
where it's already paired.

899
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:29,180
And if I have a
flush draw, I still

900
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:32,150
have lots of opportunities
to bluff on the river.

901
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,950
And if I have a
good hand, there's

902
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:36,470
not that many outs,
especially when I have a king.

903
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:38,970
So I'm just going to call and
hope that the board comes out

904
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:40,460
well, which I guess it does.

905
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,770
So I check again, because this
is how I'm playing jack-10.

906
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:48,830
This is how I'm playing
all my hands essentially.

907
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:50,150
So they check back.

908
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,720
The river is kind of bad for us.

909
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,590
But I think it's hard for them
to have a king at this point,

910
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:59,090
so I just bet out about
a bit more than half

911
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:03,980
the pot, maybe 60% of
the pot, yeah, 60%.

912
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,332
Oh, so they actually call
me with ace-seven, which

913
00:40:06,332 --> 00:40:07,540
I think is pretty reasonable.

914
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:12,560
I think ace-seven is a fine
call against my strategy,

915
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,480
because I could have
easily had jack-10

916
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,797
or queen-10 or queen-jack here.

917
00:40:17,797 --> 00:40:19,880
Although I probably also
play a nine the same way,

918
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:24,080
so they are also
paying off my nines.

919
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,280
So one good thing, actually.

920
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,950
So this is one
interesting thing to think

921
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:30,050
about that's sort of
advanced, but I think

922
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:33,590
it's cool is the fact that
they have ace-seven, I think,

923
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:36,230
makes their call a lot
better than if they had,

924
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:38,420
say, ace-10 or ace-jack.

925
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,920
And the reason for-- so even
the ace-seven is in some sense

926
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,270
a worse hand than
ace-10 and ace-jack,

927
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:45,080
they're the same on this board.

928
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,735
And the problem with
ace-10 and ace-jack

929
00:40:47,735 --> 00:40:50,180
is if they have a
10 or a jack, it's

930
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:52,760
less likely I have
a 10 or a jack.

931
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,572
So when they're
calling with ace-seven,

932
00:40:54,572 --> 00:40:56,030
essentially what
they're hoping for

933
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:59,720
is hoping for me to have jack-10
or queen-10 or queen-jack.

934
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,664
So if they have a 10 or a jack,
it just decreases that chance.

935
00:41:02,664 --> 00:41:04,580
So it's almost like
ace-seven is a better hand

936
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,206
to call with then ace-jack.

937
00:41:06,206 --> 00:41:08,330
But nonetheless, with any
ace, I think calling here

938
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:10,840
is reasonable, because I
do have plenty of bluffs.

939
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,850
Any missed straight draw,
any missed flush draw,

940
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:15,880
I will bluff in the
same way on this river.

941
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,710
OK, so the next hand.

942
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:23,430
We won a bunch of
pots, which is nice.

943
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:25,220
So we built our stack up.

944
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:30,560
So we get pocket fours here,
and this guy raises it to 1,200.

945
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,180
Pocket fours is
definitely a hand

946
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:35,070
where I want to be
bluff-reraising with.

947
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:38,390
So I'm not I'm not hoping to
get called when I reraise here,

948
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:42,290
but it's a hand that does quite
well against the range of hands

949
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:44,510
I get called by, because
a lot of times it'll just

950
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:46,010
be ace-king, ace-queen.

951
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:51,000
And they will fold quite a
large percent of the time.

952
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,250
So I definitely want to raise.

953
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:54,410
The only question is
how do I raise, right.

954
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:58,130
I could just go all in, which
has the benefit that they can't

955
00:41:58,130 --> 00:41:59,360
call and try to hit a pair.

956
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,818
Because that would
actually be bad.

957
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:03,939
Let's say I only
reraised to 3,000 here.

958
00:42:03,939 --> 00:42:05,480
It's actually kind
of bad if this guy

959
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,790
calls with this queen-jack
trying to hit a pair.

960
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:09,590
Because that's actually
the best strategy.

961
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:11,240
Basically, their
obvious strategy

962
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,710
is good against my hand.

963
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:17,190
So I want to either go all
in, which sort of denies them

964
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:21,570
that opportunity, but the
problem with going all in

965
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:24,110
is let's suppose Check
Raise picks up a hand.

966
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:26,340
Then I'm going to be losing
with my pocket fours.

967
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:30,024
So there is this
delicate balance here.

968
00:42:30,024 --> 00:42:32,190
And this is why I think
tournaments are interesting,

969
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:34,800
because there's plays that
are good against big stacks

970
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,720
and plays that are good
against small stacks.

971
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,345
But in reality in a
tournament, there's

972
00:42:38,345 --> 00:42:41,040
going to be big stacks and
small stacks at the table,

973
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,770
and often you do have to
compromise between the lesser

974
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:44,850
of two evils.

975
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:46,380
And that's sort
of what I do here.

976
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:50,019
So I decide to raise to
3,600, which is bigger

977
00:42:50,019 --> 00:42:51,060
than I'd usually make it.

978
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,400
Usually, I'd make
it maybe like 3,000.

979
00:42:53,400 --> 00:43:00,570
But when this guy is this
short, [? RoflLolBoom, ?] I

980
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:02,700
don't really want to
let them just call,

981
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:06,440
but on the other hand, I want to
be able to fold if one of these

982
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:09,090
two guys, Check Raise or
[? Vampson ?] picks up a hand.

983
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:12,290
So I sort of compromise
between making it 3,600.

984
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:13,570
They both folded.

985
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:21,390
This guy also folds, which
is, I guess, an ideal result.

986
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:24,510
The next hand we have
eight-queen offsuit,

987
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:27,540
and we make it 1,600.

988
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:31,650
So I know I said make it
2.25x, and I stand by that.

989
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,190
I think that's a good strategy.

990
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:35,719
I think at the time I'm
just, so once again, I'm

991
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:38,260
probably still playing a lot of
tables, and I'm kind of lazy.

992
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:41,520
So I'm too lazy to
type in 1,800 manually,

993
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,100
whereas the software
defaults to just 2x.

994
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:46,740
So I tend to just
2x, but I think

995
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:49,350
it's probably not the
theoretical optimal strategy.

996
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:54,660
I would guess that the optimal
thing to do is closer to 2.25x.

997
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:58,410
So [? Vampson ?]
calls us in position.

998
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:01,620
So immediately I could think of
it like, what is their range?

999
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:03,400
Because it's a
spot where I expect

1000
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,940
him to go all in with
most of their good hands.

1001
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,920
So the question is
are they trapping me,

1002
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,750
or do they literally
just always have

1003
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:13,500
a hand like jack-10 suited,
king-queen, or something

1004
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,570
like that.

1005
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:17,370
So immediately, it's sort
of an interesting spot,

1006
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:20,220
because I expect them to
mostly be raising when

1007
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:22,960
they want to play their hand.

1008
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,250
So we flop four, 10, nine.

1009
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:29,760
And it's definitely a pretty
bad board for us, overall.

1010
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,040
Like I think if, like
regardless of their strategy,

1011
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,450
like if their strategy
is to trap us sometimes,

1012
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:38,940
then this board
is just terrible.

1013
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,100
And even if their
strategy isn't to trap us,

1014
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,200
they've always got a
straight draw on this board,

1015
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,720
because they're going to
have king-queen or queen-jack

1016
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,680
or something.

1017
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,080
So I think objectively,
it's a pretty bad board.

1018
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,694
Maybe they could have ace-jack
or ace-queen themselves.

1019
00:44:51,694 --> 00:44:53,610
Although ace-queen, I
think they're definitely

1020
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:57,540
raising preflop, so
probably just ace-jack.

1021
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:59,940
I do think we're not
in great shape here,

1022
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:03,720
but I decide to bet anyway,
essentially just banking

1023
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:04,800
on my Ace of Clubs.

1024
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,800
I definitely wouldn't be betting
this without Ace of Clubs.

1025
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:11,310
But my strategy is to
bet, and if I get called,

1026
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:14,990
I'm going to go all in on any
club turn, any jack, queen,

1027
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:16,080
or ace turn.

1028
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,940
So essentially, any club turn
I'll have the nut flush draw.

1029
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:22,740
Any jack turn, I have
a good straight draw

1030
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:24,890
with two overcards,
and any queen or ace

1031
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:27,480
turn pairs with my hand.

1032
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,310
So I just think
there's enough turns

1033
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:31,460
where I can basically
continue bluffing, continue

1034
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:32,460
barreling on.

1035
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:34,264
That one barrel has to be OK.

1036
00:45:34,264 --> 00:45:35,930
But I'm only making
this play, because I

1037
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:37,230
have the Ace of Clubs.

1038
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:39,420
Even with the Queen
of Clubs, I probably

1039
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,760
would've just
given up this hand.

1040
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:42,787
But we do get a fold.

1041
00:45:42,787 --> 00:45:44,370
So I guess they
probably had ace-jack.

1042
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:45,995
That's probably their
most likely hand,

1043
00:45:45,995 --> 00:45:49,740
maybe something like
pocket sevens they folded.

1044
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:52,260
Yeah, so that sort of shows
you the importance sometimes

1045
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:53,820
of backdoor draws.

1046
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:56,422
Because let's say they
had pocket sevens here.

1047
00:45:56,422 --> 00:45:58,380
Let's say they called
with pocket sevens, which

1048
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,774
I don't think is unreasonable.

1049
00:46:00,774 --> 00:46:02,190
If I didn't have
the Ace of Clubs,

1050
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:05,504
I'm going to just have to end up
giving up on a bunch of turns,

1051
00:46:05,504 --> 00:46:07,920
and they would take down the
pot with their pocket sevens.

1052
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,700
But because I have
the Ace of Clubs,

1053
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,700
it's just very, very
unlikely they end up

1054
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:13,408
winning the hand with
the pair of sevens.

1055
00:46:13,408 --> 00:46:15,000
Because I'm going
to shove a lot of

1056
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,230
turns, and they're just
going to have to fold.

1057
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:25,970
OK, so the next hand we
get queen-jack again.

1058
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:28,490
And we raise here.

1059
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:31,550
And so this same guy,
[? Vampson, ?] they call.

1060
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:35,150
And we get a good flop.

1061
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:37,330
So I bet-- OK, so I'm
going to talk about this.

1062
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:40,770
So I bet 1,600 here,
which is quite small.

1063
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:41,670
It's like 40%.

1064
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:43,730
It's like less than
40% of the pot.

1065
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:46,220
I might have done
it out of laziness,

1066
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,350
or I might have just done
it because of my cards,

1067
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:49,975
because I have two
pair, and I'm trying

1068
00:46:49,975 --> 00:46:53,330
to sucker him in and get him to
put in all this money slowly.

1069
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:55,580
But looking back,
I definitely don't

1070
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:58,460
think this is how I want to
be playing my entire strategy

1071
00:46:58,460 --> 00:46:59,660
on this flop.

1072
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:02,960
I think I want to be betting at
least half the pot when there's

1073
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,920
a flush draw, a straight draw,
like a bunch of straight draws.

1074
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,500
I definitely think this
bet is way too small.

1075
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,930
On average, even if I
have a pretty good hand,

1076
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:14,270
let's say like
queen-nine, there's

1077
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:16,070
just a lot of bad
cards for me that I

1078
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:18,380
don't want to be betting
this small on this board.

1079
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:21,560
I don't know if at the time I
just misclicked and messed up,

1080
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:24,380
or I was lazy and I just
wanted to make it 2x,

1081
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:27,522
or I specifically had a
read that I could exploit

1082
00:47:27,522 --> 00:47:28,730
this player by betting small.

1083
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:32,850
But this is not how I would
like to balance my strategy.

1084
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,690
And If you ever see me
doing this, most likely

1085
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:39,320
I had a really good hand,
as I do in this case.

1086
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,229
So unfortunately
it doesn't work.

1087
00:47:41,229 --> 00:47:43,020
So I'm going to talk
about this a bit more.

1088
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:47,757
So I'm going to jump back
to theory just for a bit.

1089
00:47:47,757 --> 00:47:49,590
I don't think I've
talked about this before,

1090
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:52,370
but I want to say that
bet sizing depends

1091
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:53,690
on board texture.

1092
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:55,650
So let me explain
what I mean here.

1093
00:47:55,650 --> 00:47:58,180
So essentially, there's
two types of boards.

1094
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:01,880
There's dry boards
and drawy boards.

1095
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,660
So I hate this
terminology, because these

1096
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:05,690
are two words that
mean opposite things,

1097
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:07,572
and they sound very
similar, especially

1098
00:48:07,572 --> 00:48:08,530
if you don't enunciate.

1099
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:11,590
But it's dry and drawy.

1100
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:14,130
Maybe I can't
pronounce them well.

1101
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:17,420
Dry boards is basically boards
where the winner is mostly

1102
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:19,460
decided before the
river, and you're either

1103
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:21,010
way ahead or way behind.

1104
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:23,685
Drawy boards is basically
boards with a lot of flush

1105
00:48:23,685 --> 00:48:26,720
draws, straight draws,
where every subsequent card

1106
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,370
can change the board a lot.

1107
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:30,650
And it's hard to fold,
because all hands have equity.

1108
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:33,320
So in reality, most boards,
they're somewhere in between.

1109
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,480
It's a spectrum.

1110
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,479
So what are some
characteristics of dry boards?

1111
00:48:37,479 --> 00:48:39,020
Well, a board tends
to be dry if it's

1112
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:41,120
paired, like four, four, eight.

1113
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:44,080
That tends to be pretty dry,
because not much is going in.

1114
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:46,210
Most will have
missed that board.

1115
00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:48,200
A board is dry if the
highest card is big.

1116
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,230
Like if the highest card is
an ace, then against someone

1117
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:53,840
with an ace, if you don't have
a face flush or straight draw,

1118
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:56,970
you're already kind of
drawing close to dead.

1119
00:48:56,970 --> 00:49:00,140
Whereas if the highest card is
a 10, then if you have a queen,

1120
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:04,760
you always have an opportunity
to turn a queen and beat them.

1121
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:07,070
It's dry if there's no middle
cards for straight draws,

1122
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:09,980
if there's no
flush draws, or I'd

1123
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:12,740
say, if there's already four
to a flush or already four

1124
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:15,632
to a straight, then it's
also sort of dry, because--

1125
00:49:15,632 --> 00:49:17,340
like if there's already
Four of Diamonds,

1126
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:19,890
then it's also sort of
decided who wins already.

1127
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:22,070
Like if you have a
big diamond, you're

1128
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:26,002
pretty much guaranteed to
win, barring some full house.

1129
00:49:26,002 --> 00:49:27,210
Same with four to a straight.

1130
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:29,400
If it's like nine,
10, jack, queen.

1131
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:33,480
If you have a king, you're just
pretty much guaranteed to win.

1132
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,680
And so on the other hand,
what are drawy boards?

1133
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,054
It's sort of the
opposite, right.

1134
00:49:37,054 --> 00:49:38,500
Small cards, why small cards?

1135
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:41,450
Because everyone's going to have
overcards, which is six outs.

1136
00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:44,160
Flush draws or three to a
flush is also very drawy,

1137
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,060
because if there's
three to a flush,

1138
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:50,420
then someone with just any card
of that suit has a flush draw.

1139
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,070
Boards with straight draws.

1140
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:55,610
So how should your play change
on these two types of boards?

1141
00:49:55,610 --> 00:49:59,735
Well, on dry boards, you can
bet pretty small fractions

1142
00:49:59,735 --> 00:50:02,000
of the pot on the flop and turn.

1143
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,100
And your opponent might
not have the odds to call.

1144
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:08,210
So like if the flop is
ace, ace, two or maybe ace,

1145
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:10,070
ace, seven with no
flush draws, you

1146
00:50:10,070 --> 00:50:13,274
can bet like a fifth of
the pot, and your opponent

1147
00:50:13,274 --> 00:50:15,440
is still going to have to
fold a lot of their hands.

1148
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:19,650
Because if you've got an
ace, they're just way behind.

1149
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:21,290
What's another characteristic?

1150
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:24,200
Is any draw might be good
enough to make a bluff.

1151
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:28,070
So like if the board is ace,
ace, seven with no flush draw,

1152
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:31,280
and you've got like eight, nine
with a backdoor flush draw,

1153
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,050
that's a pretty good
hand to make a bluff.

1154
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:35,840
Because you've got three
to a straight and three

1155
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,970
to a flush, which
is sort of the most

1156
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:40,810
you could possibly ask for
on that flop with respect

1157
00:50:40,810 --> 00:50:42,170
to draws.

1158
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:45,890
And another aspect of playing
dry boards is slow playing.

1159
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:47,460
Tricky plays are good.

1160
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:50,300
Because the thing that matters
isn't preventing your opponent

1161
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,940
from seeing the turn and river
and not letting them see outs.

1162
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:56,180
The thing that matters is sort
of convincing your opponent

1163
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:58,670
that you have a good hand when
you don't or convincing them

1164
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:00,380
that you don't have a
good hand when you do.

1165
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:02,088
So it's all about
tricking your opponent,

1166
00:51:02,088 --> 00:51:03,710
disguising these tricky--

1167
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:05,520
I mean, I shouldn't say that.

1168
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,820
Simple play can still
be good on dry boards,

1169
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:10,949
but in general, slow
playing is reasonable

1170
00:51:10,949 --> 00:51:12,740
And tricking, trying
to trick your opponent

1171
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:14,390
is more important.

1172
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:16,320
Whereas on drawy
boards, you just

1173
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:19,100
want to bet large fractions
of the pot before the river,

1174
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:21,024
because every hand
has so many outs.

1175
00:51:21,024 --> 00:51:23,440
You really don't want to be
giving them good odds to call.

1176
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,180
And on the flop and turn,
if you don't have anything,

1177
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:27,620
then just don't
put any money in.

1178
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:30,470
Because bluffing is pretty
moot, because so many hands

1179
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:32,216
aren't folding,
because they have outs.

1180
00:51:32,216 --> 00:51:33,590
And yeah, don't
really slow play.

1181
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,162
If you have a good
hand, similarly,

1182
00:51:35,162 --> 00:51:37,370
just put all the money in
right away, because they're

1183
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:38,960
going to call very often,
because they're always

1184
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,220
going to have some outs.

1185
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:44,521
So that's roughly
how the play changes.

1186
00:51:44,521 --> 00:51:45,770
OK, so I'll come back to this.

1187
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:47,150
We'll see these hands in a bit.

1188
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:49,520
So coming back to
this queen-jack hand,

1189
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,890
the reason why I think
my bet is too small

1190
00:51:51,890 --> 00:51:54,470
is because I would
consider this queen, jack,

1191
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:57,950
three with a flush draw to be
a fairly drawy board, fairly

1192
00:51:57,950 --> 00:52:01,130
close to the drawy
end of the spectrum.

1193
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:04,250
And I said you have to bet
big fractions of the pot

1194
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:07,250
and here I am betting close to
a third of the pot on the flop.

1195
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:09,510
So I think it is
not a good strategy,

1196
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:12,189
but I take the pot down.

1197
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:23,420
OK, so the next hand, we
have ace-queen offsuit.

1198
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:25,910
So this guy calls.

1199
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:31,520
My rule was roughly
raising it to 3x plus one.

1200
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,711
So you could count how many
limpers there are before you,

1201
00:52:34,711 --> 00:52:36,710
and you add three to that,
and you multiply that

1202
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:38,751
by the big blind is roughly
what you raise it to.

1203
00:52:38,751 --> 00:52:40,550
So in this case, 4,000.

1204
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:43,430
I make it 4,250.

1205
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:45,670
If they decide to do some
weird plays, by the way,

1206
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:48,320
like if they go all in here,
I'm definitely calling.

1207
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,820
I am just not going
to believe them,

1208
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:52,694
and ace-queen offsuit is
definitely good enough.

1209
00:52:52,694 --> 00:52:54,110
So they decide to
just call, which

1210
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:57,210
is a bit weird considering
their odds aren't that good,

1211
00:52:57,210 --> 00:53:00,800
and they're out of position.

1212
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,260
We flop three hearts, and
we have the Queen of Hearts.

1213
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:06,590
And in this situation,
I'm just betting

1214
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:08,000
pretty big into the pot.

1215
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,820
So I consider this to
be a fairly drawy flop,

1216
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:13,780
so I bet big.

1217
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:15,860
Even though I'm in
position-- so position

1218
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:17,840
is sort of an incentive
to maybe bet smaller,

1219
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:20,300
because you have position
on later streets.

1220
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:23,150
And you can control the betting
better on later streets.

1221
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:26,180
So this is a fairly big bet
considering I'm in position.

1222
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:29,450
But I'm just happy
to get it in here.

1223
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:31,400
So contrast this
with an earlier hand.

1224
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:35,540
I think I also had
ace-queen, except I only

1225
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:36,770
had three to a flush.

1226
00:53:36,770 --> 00:53:39,440
And I said it was very important
that I had the ace of the suit.

1227
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:42,890
But here it's just very hard
for me to be in terrible shape.

1228
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:45,680
Like in theory they
could have, I suppose,

1229
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,630
ace-nine with an Ace of Hearts.

1230
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:49,130
Like that hand would
be crushing me,

1231
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:51,520
because I would be drawing
to literally three outs

1232
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,760
to carry my queen.

1233
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:55,010
But it's just there's not
that many combinations,

1234
00:53:55,010 --> 00:53:57,860
because it would involve an
offsuit hand, which they're

1235
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:00,740
way less likely to have when
they call me out of position.

1236
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:02,780
Or it would involve a
hand like pocket kings

1237
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:06,080
with the King of Hearts,
which is also pretty unlikely,

1238
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:08,810
because they probably would
have done some raising preflop.

1239
00:54:08,810 --> 00:54:11,270
So I just think no
matter what they have,

1240
00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:13,030
I'm going to be in
great shape here.

1241
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:16,060
I just have more than
enough outs to just gamble.

1242
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:17,390
And so they fold.

1243
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:26,530
OK, the next hand
we had queen-10 off.

1244
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:28,510
So I opened from under the gun.

1245
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:29,440
I think it's fine.

1246
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,750
It looks a bit loose,
and it is, but I

1247
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:36,380
think in terms of raising some
smaller cards to balance it,

1248
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:38,824
so that I will sometimes have
smaller cards in my hand.

1249
00:54:38,824 --> 00:54:40,990
You know you can't really
ask for more than a suited

1250
00:54:40,990 --> 00:54:42,070
connector.

1251
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:44,380
So queen-10 suited, I
raise from under the gun.

1252
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:47,276
And the big blind calls
when they only start

1253
00:54:47,276 --> 00:54:50,920
the hand being 18 bets deep.

1254
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,050
So we flop two, two, 10.

1255
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:57,400
So this is a good example of a
very dry board, where there's

1256
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:00,220
really not much going on.

1257
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:02,350
And it is possible
they have a deuce,

1258
00:55:02,350 --> 00:55:05,770
but just in general, there is no
straight draws, no flush draws.

1259
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:07,610
I guess there are
some overcards,

1260
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:12,280
but still, it's pretty close
to as dry as you can get.

1261
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,440
And they checked
to me, and I bet

1262
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:17,039
2,000, which I think is
actually too big here.

1263
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:19,330
To be honest, I don't think
I needed to risk this much.

1264
00:55:19,330 --> 00:55:23,230
I mean, I have a good hand
but if I didn't have a pair,

1265
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:26,110
I only want to be
betting like 1,500.

1266
00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:27,390
I think that's a fine size.

1267
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:29,920
I think betting 1,500 is more
than enough on this board,

1268
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,750
just because there's
really nothing going on.

1269
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:34,930
But I guess I was lazy.

1270
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:40,860
I bet 2,000, and they call.

1271
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:43,000
So as you can see,
there's a huge difference

1272
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,010
between my flop bet
sizing depending

1273
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:46,420
on the texture of the board.

1274
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:48,490
And that's sort of--

1275
00:55:48,490 --> 00:55:50,410
that's the point I
wanted to drive across

1276
00:55:50,410 --> 00:55:52,640
through some of these examples.

1277
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,710
So they call me.

1278
00:55:53,710 --> 00:55:57,432
So we turn a six,
and they check.

1279
00:55:57,432 --> 00:55:59,140
I'm just going to keep
it simple and bet.

1280
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:00,880
I'm not going to
try anything tricky.

1281
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:05,640
And obviously I'm not folding
with top pair and a flush draw.

1282
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:06,780
So they go all in.

1283
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,290
I call.

1284
00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:10,440
So we river a flush,
and it turned out

1285
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,470
to actually be necessary,
because they had a deuce.

1286
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:17,670
So it is possible here, I
think, for them to have a deuce.

1287
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:22,050
I think their play preflop is a
bit loose with two-nine suited

1288
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:23,860
but not completely terrible.

1289
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:26,550
Because with 4.5
to 1 odds, nothing

1290
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:27,870
is really that terrible.

1291
00:56:27,870 --> 00:56:29,550
But I guess we get lucky.

1292
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:31,560
But I do think their
call is a bit marginal.

1293
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:35,040
Because we are under the gun,
so our range is fairly strong.

1294
00:56:38,749 --> 00:56:39,790
That's a nice pot to win.

1295
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:43,210
So we're a fairly big stack now.

1296
00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:45,370
I guess we're chip
leader at the table.

1297
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:49,650
And Check Raise
mid-raises from there.

1298
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:51,400
And we have pocket deuces.

1299
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,590
I think definitely
our hand is too weak

1300
00:56:53,590 --> 00:56:56,680
to go all in with as a bluff
against an under-the-gun

1301
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:57,670
opening range.

1302
00:56:57,670 --> 00:57:01,210
So the only options
really are call or fold.

1303
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:04,042
Basically our hand does have
terrible reverse implied odds

1304
00:57:04,042 --> 00:57:04,750
post-flop though.

1305
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:08,710
So I think if you wanted to fold
here, it wouldn't be terrible.

1306
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:12,100
But I guess I think calling
is fine, too, with 4.5 to 1.

1307
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:16,060
And also in some sense, you
do have odds to set mine here

1308
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:18,316
I think.

1309
00:57:18,316 --> 00:57:20,857
The chances of hitting a third
deuce on the flop is about one

1310
00:57:20,857 --> 00:57:21,970
in eight.

1311
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:26,830
My odds are only 4.5 to 1,
but there are implied odds

1312
00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:28,000
in the case I do hit a set.

1313
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,200
So literally if my
strategy is call and fold

1314
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,980
unless the flop
has a two on it, I

1315
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:34,960
don't think I'm losing
a ton of money there.

1316
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:38,530
And if there ever is a
case where they check down,

1317
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:41,560
and I get to take down the
pot with just a pair of twos,

1318
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:44,700
then I'm just printing
money by calling.

1319
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:47,560
So I decided to call.

1320
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:49,870
The flop doesn't have
a two, so it's bad.

1321
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:53,140
But out of the flops that don't
have a two, it's probably not

1322
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:55,810
that bad, considering
the three and seven

1323
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:58,660
is not that likely to pair
him when he's under the gun.

1324
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:00,630
But nonetheless I fold.

1325
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:03,100
You know like if I could do
the cheat I talked about where

1326
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:05,350
I could disconnect and
call and see the river,

1327
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:06,400
I definitely would.

1328
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,727
But if I call, I have to
decide again on the turn

1329
00:58:09,727 --> 00:58:12,310
whether to call and decide again
on the river whether to call,

1330
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:15,490
and it's just not going to
be a good situation, even

1331
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:18,580
though for this immediate
bet, I think I definitely

1332
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:21,520
have odds to call with
a backdoor flush draw,

1333
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:24,070
and often they're just
going to have ace-king.

1334
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:26,350
It's just impossible
to play the hand good.

1335
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:29,110
This sort of just
demonstrates why

1336
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:31,560
it's very risky when you decide
to play a hand like pocket

1337
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:33,268
deuces out of position,
because it's just

1338
00:58:33,268 --> 00:58:34,500
very easy to get roped in.

1339
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:37,560
Like let's say I call here, and
then I call the flop thinking

1340
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:38,670
they might have ace-king.

1341
00:58:38,670 --> 00:58:40,630
They bet small, so
I have good odds,

1342
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:42,100
and I have a
backdoor flush draw.

1343
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:44,590
So let's say I call,
and then the turn

1344
00:58:44,590 --> 00:58:46,790
is like the Five of
Clubs or something,

1345
00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:48,690
and they bet like
40% of the pot.

1346
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:52,440
Well, am I going to talk
myself into a call again?

1347
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,520
Maybe, because now
I hit a third club.

1348
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:57,880
But if I do then, if the
river's something random--

1349
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,690
it's just all these
decisions that I'm not

1350
00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:00,940
going to be able to make well.

1351
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:03,587
Whereas for my opponent,
it's going to be fairly easy.

1352
00:59:03,587 --> 00:59:05,420
They're going to just
bluff their bad hands,

1353
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:08,020
value bet their good hands,
and check down the hands

1354
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:09,330
in the middle which beat me.

1355
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:17,000
OK, so the next hand we
get ace-king offsuit,

1356
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,210
and we raise, and
the big blind calls.

1357
00:59:20,210 --> 00:59:22,430
The flop is nine, two, seven.

1358
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:24,800
So note that the big blind
just got moved to the table,

1359
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:25,940
and they actually cover us.

1360
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:28,330
So they're probably
one of the biggest

1361
00:59:28,330 --> 00:59:31,080
stacks in the tournament.

1362
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:32,640
So they check to us.

1363
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,472
I decide to check
back here, which

1364
00:59:34,472 --> 00:59:36,180
I don't think is
terrible, but I think is

1365
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:39,790
a bit of a scared play that I--

1366
00:59:39,790 --> 00:59:42,680
I think I would have
rather saw myself bet.

1367
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:47,420
If I was shallower, like let's
say we only had 20,000 chips,

1368
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:49,750
then I think just
checking is good.

1369
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:51,204
Because if I bet,
they're probably

1370
00:59:51,204 --> 00:59:53,620
going to be check-raising with
a lot of their flush draws,

1371
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:55,130
straight draws,
and then like pairs

1372
00:59:55,130 --> 00:59:56,780
of nines or pairs of sevens.

1373
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:59,300
And I'm going to have to
fold with a pretty good hand

1374
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:02,720
where I have two good overcards
and a backdoor flush draw,

1375
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:06,686
but when it's this deep, they
really can't just check-raise

1376
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:08,810
a nine, because they're
going to have to be worried

1377
01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:10,910
about pocket aces on our part.

1378
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:12,400
So I think it's--

1379
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,540
we're not going to get
check-raised that often,

1380
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:16,940
and by betting, we just
make the pot bigger

1381
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:19,850
when we do hit a king
or an ace and also

1382
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:21,950
make it more likely
that we can bluff them

1383
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:24,380
off a nine or a
seven by the river.

1384
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:26,510
So I would have liked
to see myself bet,

1385
01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:28,250
but I don't think
checking is terrible,

1386
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:31,280
by the argument that I
will most of the time,

1387
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,207
you know by betting
I am folding out

1388
01:00:33,207 --> 01:00:34,790
basically all the
hands that I've beat

1389
01:00:34,790 --> 01:00:37,820
and keeping in all the
hands that beat me.

1390
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:40,280
It's close but I would have
liked to see myself bet.

1391
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:42,949
But as played, you know, if
I'm going to check the flop,

1392
01:00:42,949 --> 01:00:44,240
I'm not going to bet this turn.

1393
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,070
Because the whole point
of betting the flop

1394
01:00:46,070 --> 01:00:49,100
is so that I could potentially
bet the turn and bet the river

1395
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:52,070
and get him to fold a pair
of nines or a pair of sevens,

1396
01:00:52,070 --> 01:00:54,137
but by now I'm not
going to really

1397
01:00:54,137 --> 01:00:55,970
have any hope of getting
him to fold a nine.

1398
01:00:55,970 --> 01:01:00,290
And I'm just trying to win
the pot with my ace-king high.

1399
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:02,130
And so yeah, I
just check it down.

1400
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:04,130
The river check, I think,
is very, very obvious,

1401
01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:06,505
because I'm literally only
getting called by better hands

1402
01:01:06,505 --> 01:01:08,970
if I bet the river.

1403
01:01:08,970 --> 01:01:10,430
They have queen-10.

1404
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:12,680
I think they probably should
have bluffed the river.

1405
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:14,730
I think queen-10 is
weak enough where

1406
01:01:14,730 --> 01:01:17,780
they're just very rarely winning
the pot with queen-10 high.

1407
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:21,470
They basically need to bluff
and then put me to a decision.

1408
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:23,120
But nice to win that.

1409
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:29,090
The next hand we have
jack-10, not too exciting.

1410
01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:33,090
So this same guy who's now the
button, raises from the button.

1411
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:35,644
And we call, and
we flop nothing.

1412
01:01:35,644 --> 01:01:37,810
So the best thing to do is
bluff off all your chips,

1413
01:01:37,810 --> 01:01:39,738
but no, I just fold.

1414
01:01:39,738 --> 01:01:41,184
[LAUGHTER]

1415
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:47,404
OK, so the next hand, it's also
against this [? GarlaEDU. ?]

1416
01:01:47,404 --> 01:01:48,820
So the two big
stacks at the table

1417
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:51,610
are actually playing a lot
of hands against each other.

1418
01:01:51,610 --> 01:01:53,870
I just call here with jacks.

1419
01:01:53,870 --> 01:01:56,606
I don't think it would be
terrible to just raise and bet

1420
01:01:56,606 --> 01:02:02,620
it all in, but I think it is
sort of unnecessarily risky.

1421
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:04,730
I think it wouldn't
be a terrible play

1422
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:07,150
to just raise and get it all
in, but it's definitely thin.

1423
01:02:07,150 --> 01:02:10,270
Like you're not printing value
by raising and getting it

1424
01:02:10,270 --> 01:02:12,542
all in, because if
they reraise all in,

1425
01:02:12,542 --> 01:02:14,250
their range is going
to be pretty strong.

1426
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:18,040
And pocket jacks is not
really crushing them.

1427
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:20,950
I think you need to
have queens or better

1428
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:25,270
to really be hoping to get it
all in against this guy here.

1429
01:02:25,270 --> 01:02:26,800
So with jacks I just call.

1430
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:29,420
And also, you know, this
protects my calling range

1431
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:30,130
of it.

1432
01:02:30,130 --> 01:02:34,070
Let's say, like Check Raise
thinks I'm weak and decides

1433
01:02:34,070 --> 01:02:35,230
to make a play here.

1434
01:02:35,230 --> 01:02:40,450
And they reraise to like 10,000,
then if [? GarlaEDU ?] folds,

1435
01:02:40,450 --> 01:02:43,110
I can come back around and go
all in and sort of surprise

1436
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:44,050
them.

1437
01:02:44,050 --> 01:02:47,041
So it does protect my
calling range a bit as well.

1438
01:02:47,041 --> 01:02:47,540
I call.

1439
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:51,160
We get a nine, six, five flop.

1440
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:52,970
They check, and I bet.

1441
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:55,270
I think betting is a
fairly natural play.

1442
01:02:55,270 --> 01:02:56,820
I don't want to
give ace-king outs.

1443
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:58,780
And I just want to
win the pot right now,

1444
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:01,360
but I was thinking
to myself after

1445
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:05,590
that if they check-raised here,
that's really a gross spot.

1446
01:03:05,590 --> 01:03:08,841
Actually, I would hate my
life if they check-raised me.

1447
01:03:08,841 --> 01:03:10,840
Because I literally don't
know what I should do.

1448
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:16,990
On one hand, I would
be inclined to fold,

1449
01:03:16,990 --> 01:03:18,640
because it's kind
of weird for them

1450
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:23,980
to want to check-raise
me here without having

1451
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:26,710
like a bigger pair or a
flush draw with lots of outs.

1452
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:28,780
But at the same
time, it's just why

1453
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:31,470
would they check pocket
aces to me here, maybe

1454
01:03:31,470 --> 01:03:32,810
to try to trap me.

1455
01:03:32,810 --> 01:03:34,810
It would have been a
really gross spot, I think,

1456
01:03:34,810 --> 01:03:36,100
if I got check-raised.

1457
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:39,730
And by that argument, I think
against a very tricky player,

1458
01:03:39,730 --> 01:03:42,110
if you could be
check-raising here as a trap

1459
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:45,520
and as a bluff with a balance
strategy, maybe checking

1460
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:47,660
is better just to
protect myself from that.

1461
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:51,190
But I think against him, I was
reasonably confident nothing

1462
01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:52,835
crazy was going to happen.

1463
01:03:52,835 --> 01:03:53,960
And yes, so they just fold.

1464
01:03:59,432 --> 01:04:00,890
OK, so it's against
this guy again.

1465
01:04:00,890 --> 01:04:03,550
I guess we're playing a lot of
pots against the same player.

1466
01:04:03,550 --> 01:04:05,440
I think it's getting fairly
late into the tournament

1467
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:06,090
at this point.

1468
01:04:06,090 --> 01:04:08,610
It's not a huge tournament,
maybe like 80, 90 players,

1469
01:04:08,610 --> 01:04:12,027
and it's probably down to
like 20, 25 at this point.

1470
01:04:12,027 --> 01:04:12,610
So they raise.

1471
01:04:12,610 --> 01:04:14,260
We call with queen-eight off.

1472
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:16,810
We're a bit deep here, so
our reverse implied odds

1473
01:04:16,810 --> 01:04:17,890
are actually sort of bad.

1474
01:04:17,890 --> 01:04:23,290
But we decide to call, and
we flop two, three, five.

1475
01:04:23,290 --> 01:04:25,190
So I'm just going to fold here.

1476
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:27,110
But they decide to check.

1477
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:29,800
And then we turn a flush
draw, but I'm still just going

1478
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:34,810
to check and basically bet
pretty much every river, maybe

1479
01:04:34,810 --> 01:04:36,640
not an eight river.

1480
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:39,520
So we river a six, and I
essentially bet as a bluff,

1481
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:44,382
because our hand has no hope of
winning if it gets a showdown.

1482
01:04:44,382 --> 01:04:45,340
And it works this time.

1483
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:47,870
So yeah, we played a
lot of pots against him.

1484
01:04:47,870 --> 01:04:51,050
And it seems like they
are fairly willing to just

1485
01:04:51,050 --> 01:04:53,510
check and fold their hands,
so not too aggressive.

1486
01:04:53,510 --> 01:04:55,540
So I guess one thing
to keep in mind

1487
01:04:55,540 --> 01:05:01,720
is maybe we can get out of the
way if we do see them raising.

1488
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:05,302
OK, so this situation is
similar to the situation

1489
01:05:05,302 --> 01:05:06,760
in the very first
hand we discussed

1490
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:10,690
where we had king-queen, and
we had roughly 30 big blinds.

1491
01:05:10,690 --> 01:05:12,460
And I talked sort of
about the benefits

1492
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:14,170
of raising versus calling.

1493
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:16,580
It's pretty much the
exact same situation.

1494
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:19,870
And I decided to sort of
raise, essentially as a bluff,

1495
01:05:19,870 --> 01:05:23,710
but also king-queen plays
pretty well when they do call.

1496
01:05:23,710 --> 01:05:26,950
Because I'm always good
when I hit top pair.

1497
01:05:26,950 --> 01:05:29,590
So make it 8,000.

1498
01:05:29,590 --> 01:05:31,890
But unfortunately, this
time this [? GerarDocks ?]

1499
01:05:31,890 --> 01:05:32,860
goes all in.

1500
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:35,160
So we basically
just have to fold.

1501
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:38,200
Yeah, unfortunately,
8,000 is small enough

1502
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,700
where we can just
happily get away here.

1503
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:42,880
And it actually turns
out this guy also

1504
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:45,980
goes on, which makes the
decision even easier.

1505
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:49,230
So it looks like we ran into
pocket aces and pocket kings

1506
01:05:49,230 --> 01:05:50,645
that time.

1507
01:05:50,645 --> 01:05:53,878
It doesn't always work when
you reraise with king-queen.

1508
01:05:56,972 --> 01:05:58,555
All right, so still
at the same table,

1509
01:05:58,555 --> 01:06:01,500
we get ace-jack
offsuit, under the gun.

1510
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:06,260
We reraise, and this
[? GerarDocks ?] guy calls.

1511
01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:08,690
We flop king, nine,
deuce with two hearts,

1512
01:06:08,690 --> 01:06:13,280
and I think this is sort of
pretty much the worst flop, one

1513
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:16,250
of the worst flops I could get.

1514
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:19,340
If there was like two higher
cards like a king and a queen,

1515
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:21,320
I would have a
gutshot straight draw.

1516
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:24,080
And if it was all low cards,
I'd have two overcards,

1517
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:27,260
but here there's a flush
draw that I have no part of.

1518
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:30,050
And also, they are somewhat
likely to have a king,

1519
01:06:30,050 --> 01:06:32,810
and if they do, I only have
three outs and my aces,

1520
01:06:32,810 --> 01:06:34,850
so I'm just going give this up.

1521
01:06:34,850 --> 01:06:37,220
So I talk about the power
of continuation betting

1522
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:39,500
before where continuation
betting is good,

1523
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:41,780
because my range is
stronger than theirs.

1524
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:42,710
I could have aces.

1525
01:06:42,710 --> 01:06:44,129
I can bluff, et cetera.

1526
01:06:44,129 --> 01:06:45,920
And yeah, in general,
continuation betting,

1527
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,870
being aggressive,
especially when

1528
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:49,830
you're the pre-flop
aggressor, is very good.

1529
01:06:49,830 --> 01:06:52,070
But I think this is just
one of the worst flops,

1530
01:06:52,070 --> 01:06:54,740
and I'm just going to give up.

1531
01:06:54,740 --> 01:06:55,730
So I check.

1532
01:06:55,730 --> 01:06:57,980
They bet, and I fold.

1533
01:06:57,980 --> 01:07:00,830
I mean, I think sometimes I will
check a reasonably good hand

1534
01:07:00,830 --> 01:07:03,180
here to protect the times--

1535
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:06,320
so that they can't just
bet here with any two cards

1536
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:07,580
and know for sure I'll fold.

1537
01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:09,330
But most of the time
if I'm checking here,

1538
01:07:09,330 --> 01:07:12,350
I'm going to be fairly weak,
which is maybe exploitable.

1539
01:07:12,350 --> 01:07:14,210
But I give up the hand.

1540
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,800
So eight-five suited.

1541
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,860
I decide to call
on the small blind.

1542
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:22,610
I know this goes against
my recommendation

1543
01:07:22,610 --> 01:07:23,930
from the first class.

1544
01:07:23,930 --> 01:07:26,540
I think calling from the
small blind is actually,

1545
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:28,340
both theoretically
and practically,

1546
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:30,846
a pretty good strategy
for a lot of cases,

1547
01:07:30,846 --> 01:07:31,970
but it's a bit complicated.

1548
01:07:31,970 --> 01:07:36,210
Because you have to sometimes
limp raise as a bluff.

1549
01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:38,567
You have to sometimes limp
raise and trap with aces.

1550
01:07:38,567 --> 01:07:39,650
So it's a bit complicated.

1551
01:07:39,650 --> 01:07:43,170
So I just said for simplicity,
you should just raise or fold,

1552
01:07:43,170 --> 01:07:44,720
which is still a
reasonable I think.

1553
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:48,560
But I decide to call
here, and it's checked.

1554
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:50,310
We get a pretty good
flop for our hands

1555
01:07:50,310 --> 01:07:52,710
but probably a better
flop for his range,

1556
01:07:52,710 --> 01:07:56,330
because when we call, we're
less likely to have really

1557
01:07:56,330 --> 01:07:57,860
small cards than he does.

1558
01:07:57,860 --> 01:08:00,020
But I mean, we have a
good flop for our hand,

1559
01:08:00,020 --> 01:08:02,780
so I am still going
to bet my hand.

1560
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:06,386
So I bet half pot,
which is maybe not big

1561
01:08:06,386 --> 01:08:07,760
enough, to be
honest, considering

1562
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,740
how dry the board is.

1563
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:11,210
And we get a call.

1564
01:08:11,210 --> 01:08:16,422
We turn a nine, which is a
great card, because it gives--

1565
01:08:16,422 --> 01:08:17,880
not only does it
complete our hand,

1566
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:20,689
there's lot of draws out there,
and I bet quite big here.

1567
01:08:20,689 --> 01:08:23,359
So this is where I was talking
about if the board is drawy,

1568
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:26,270
you need to bet big and not
give your opponent odds.

1569
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:30,622
So I bet 688 into 10,800.

1570
01:08:30,622 --> 01:08:32,330
The reason for the
eights is because it's

1571
01:08:32,330 --> 01:08:35,760
easier to type
like 688 then 6800,

1572
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:37,370
so you'll see that quite a lot.

1573
01:08:40,609 --> 01:08:43,059
And we get called.

1574
01:08:43,059 --> 01:08:45,350
Yeah, and another, sometimes
you can get more creative,

1575
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:47,470
you can do like 1234567.

1576
01:08:47,470 --> 01:08:50,090
That's a popular bet, because
you can just slide your finger

1577
01:08:50,090 --> 01:08:52,130
across the keyboard.

1578
01:08:52,130 --> 01:08:54,890
Yeah, there's a lot of
weird idiosyncrasies, OK,

1579
01:08:54,890 --> 01:09:01,410
so I bet 15,555
here, and he folds.

1580
01:09:01,410 --> 01:09:03,720
I'm playing like this with
my missed spade draws,

1581
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:06,620
and I missed heart draws.

1582
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:08,564
Unfortunately, we
don't get paid off.

1583
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:14,210
OK, so jack-eight suited here.

1584
01:09:14,210 --> 01:09:15,890
The small blind raises.

1585
01:09:15,890 --> 01:09:21,025
Definitely I'm going to
call, and we flop top pair.

1586
01:09:21,025 --> 01:09:25,420
They bet, and-- so I think this
is a spot where I think my hand

1587
01:09:25,420 --> 01:09:26,149
is--

1588
01:09:26,149 --> 01:09:29,020
there's benefits of raising
and benefits of calling.

1589
01:09:29,020 --> 01:09:31,750
And overall, I decided
the benefits of raising

1590
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:32,398
were higher.

1591
01:09:32,398 --> 01:09:33,939
So I decided to
raise and just get it

1592
01:09:33,939 --> 01:09:37,240
all in, although I think
calling is not unreasonable,

1593
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:39,790
because your hand sort
of isn't good enough

1594
01:09:39,790 --> 01:09:42,760
where you are just really,
really happy to get it all in.

1595
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:45,176
I mean, it's good enough where
I'm going to get it all in,

1596
01:09:45,176 --> 01:09:47,740
but I'm not like thrilled
if they go all in,

1597
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:48,729
and I have to call.

1598
01:09:48,729 --> 01:09:51,460
So that's one disadvantage
of getting it all in,

1599
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:55,630
but I just think compared to
the advantage of not giving them

1600
01:09:55,630 --> 01:09:58,436
a chance to suck out
on me and beat me

1601
01:09:58,436 --> 01:10:00,580
in the hand is a
pretty big advantage,

1602
01:10:00,580 --> 01:10:04,387
not letting a queen,
king, or ace roll off.

1603
01:10:04,387 --> 01:10:06,970
Another advantage of calling is
being able to pick off bluffs.

1604
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:09,250
But I just think in
this spot, I want

1605
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:12,430
to play a strategy where I'm
going to raise to a small size

1606
01:10:12,430 --> 01:10:15,370
and put him to the decision,
both with my top pairs

1607
01:10:15,370 --> 01:10:19,360
like jacks and also my hands
like seven-nine or whatever.

1608
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:22,210
So I decided to
raise, but I think

1609
01:10:22,210 --> 01:10:24,395
calling would have been
fine and [INAUDIBLE]..

1610
01:10:27,879 --> 01:10:29,170
The next hand we have ace-king.

1611
01:10:29,170 --> 01:10:31,547
All right, so we got like
seven more hands to get to.

1612
01:10:31,547 --> 01:10:33,130
I'll go a bit quickly
here at the end,

1613
01:10:33,130 --> 01:10:35,340
but I think we'll get
through all the hands.

1614
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:36,430
This hand is fairly easy.

1615
01:10:36,430 --> 01:10:39,250
They make it 5,000,
and we have ace-king,

1616
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:40,750
and we just go all in.

1617
01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:43,690
There's no point slow
playing essentially,

1618
01:10:43,690 --> 01:10:45,520
especially when if
they have jack-10,

1619
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:46,880
they have lots of outs.

1620
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,599
So we go all in, and they fold.

1621
01:10:48,599 --> 01:10:50,890
So it is a bit curious here,
because they actually only

1622
01:10:50,890 --> 01:10:52,112
had 12 big blinds here.

1623
01:10:52,112 --> 01:10:54,070
So they could have just
went all in themselves,

1624
01:10:54,070 --> 01:10:56,890
but they decided
to raise small, so

1625
01:10:56,890 --> 01:10:59,470
that they could fold if someone
behind picks up a monster.

1626
01:10:59,470 --> 01:11:01,632
And I guess they were
paid off this time.

1627
01:11:06,830 --> 01:11:09,110
But yeah, like for this
hand, like one disadvantage

1628
01:11:09,110 --> 01:11:11,882
of their play, suppose
we had king-two suited.

1629
01:11:11,882 --> 01:11:13,590
We would have folded
if they went all in,

1630
01:11:13,590 --> 01:11:16,300
but now we can call
and see a flop.

1631
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:18,710
But because we had
ace-king, I guess

1632
01:11:18,710 --> 01:11:23,190
they profited from not
committing their whole stack.

1633
01:11:23,190 --> 01:11:25,200
OK, we have king-jack offsuit.

1634
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:30,630
We make it 6,000, and
this guy goes all in.

1635
01:11:30,630 --> 01:11:31,330
I fold here.

1636
01:11:31,330 --> 01:11:32,660
I think it's not that close.

1637
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:34,410
I think with king-jack
suited, it's close.

1638
01:11:34,410 --> 01:11:36,390
But I'd still fold
with king-jack suited.

1639
01:11:36,390 --> 01:11:39,480
I'd probably call with
ace-jack offsuit plus.

1640
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:41,940
I would probably call
with ace-10 suited,

1641
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:44,430
and I'd call with king-queen
suited and probably

1642
01:11:44,430 --> 01:11:46,680
king-queen offsuit as well.

1643
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:50,520
In this case-- so in the last
class, I said being suited

1644
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:52,950
is very important
when you're behind.

1645
01:11:52,950 --> 01:11:54,570
But when you're
potentially ahead,

1646
01:11:54,570 --> 01:11:57,170
just having a slightly better
hand is very important.

1647
01:11:57,170 --> 01:12:00,390
So I think in this situation,
I would fold king-jack suited

1648
01:12:00,390 --> 01:12:02,490
but call with
king-queen offsuit,

1649
01:12:02,490 --> 01:12:04,650
because a decent
part of his range

1650
01:12:04,650 --> 01:12:06,908
is hands like king-jack
and king-queen.

1651
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:14,206
Here I have king-queen
and Degenerated-- so

1652
01:12:14,206 --> 01:12:16,580
for some reason, I love making
this play with king-queen.

1653
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:18,340
It's actually not
that unfounded.

1654
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:21,900
It's just a good hand to bluff
with that at the same time

1655
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:25,020
sort of protects your range
in the case that he calls,

1656
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:28,290
and also your hand doesn't play
that well if you just call.

1657
01:12:28,290 --> 01:12:31,620
Because you're not suited,
so it really is king-queen--

1658
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:34,870
I mean in this
tournament, we've happened

1659
01:12:34,870 --> 01:12:36,600
to have been dealt
king-queen a lot

1660
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:40,170
and gotten into situations where
we can reraise-bluff people.

1661
01:12:40,170 --> 01:12:44,100
But it really is my favorite
hand to do this with.

1662
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:45,780
It might even be
too predictable,

1663
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:49,464
because I just always have
king-queen whenever I do this.

1664
01:12:49,464 --> 01:12:50,630
But we do take it down here.

1665
01:12:54,230 --> 01:12:55,410
Ace-jack offsuit.

1666
01:12:55,410 --> 01:12:57,872
This guy, so this
Degenerated guy who we just--

1667
01:12:57,872 --> 01:13:00,330
at this point, it's probably
late enough in the tournament.

1668
01:13:00,330 --> 01:13:03,360
I am paying attention, and I
am aware that I just reraised

1669
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:05,410
this guy three hands earlier.

1670
01:13:05,410 --> 01:13:07,760
So they make a big
raise here, do 9,000.

1671
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:13,070
And I call with ace-jack,
which I regret quite a bit.

1672
01:13:13,070 --> 01:13:14,820
I think it's just too
weak a hand to play.

1673
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:17,940
And if I'm going to play it, I
think I should just go all in

1674
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:19,470
and try to win the hand preflop.

1675
01:13:19,470 --> 01:13:21,750
Even though I'm in
position, I think it's just

1676
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:23,940
going to be hard to play.

1677
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:25,340
Even when I hit
an ace or a jack,

1678
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:28,150
I'm still going to
quite often be behind.

1679
01:13:28,150 --> 01:13:30,740
And if I don't hit
an ace or a jack,

1680
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:33,030
I'm pretty much always
just going to have to fold.

1681
01:13:33,030 --> 01:13:34,920
And that's basically
what happens.

1682
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:41,070
So I don't know why I just
gave away 9,000 chips there.

1683
01:13:41,070 --> 01:13:44,320
OK, so queen-jack suited.

1684
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,930
I just go all in from the
small blind, because it's--

1685
01:13:46,930 --> 01:13:49,780
so even though we have 15 big
blinds, which is more than 12,

1686
01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:52,510
I said last class that
from the small blind,

1687
01:13:52,510 --> 01:13:54,580
you're really, really
incentivized to go

1688
01:13:54,580 --> 01:13:57,040
all in, because
if you don't then

1689
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:58,540
the other guy has position.

1690
01:13:58,540 --> 01:14:01,060
Whereas like from the
button, if you just raise,

1691
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:02,740
the big blind calls,
you have position.

1692
01:14:02,740 --> 01:14:04,410
So I go all in.

1693
01:14:04,410 --> 01:14:06,610
Queen-jack suited is
more than good enough.

1694
01:14:06,610 --> 01:14:11,000
And we get a fold.

1695
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,750
And the next hand, OK,
so this is actually

1696
01:14:12,750 --> 01:14:13,625
a great illustration.

1697
01:14:13,625 --> 01:14:15,740
The very next hand we
get queen-jack off,

1698
01:14:15,740 --> 01:14:17,540
and we just raise
from the button.

1699
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:20,160
And it's exactly the reason I
said, because we have position.

1700
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:24,230
So we don't mind if the
pot gets played post-flop.

1701
01:14:24,230 --> 01:14:25,850
So the small blind goes all in.

1702
01:14:25,850 --> 01:14:28,970
And note that they're
actually fairly short here.

1703
01:14:28,970 --> 01:14:31,640
They only have 14 big
blinds to start the hand.

1704
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:34,420
So I would have easily
with queen-jack suited.

1705
01:14:34,420 --> 01:14:38,510
Even with queen-jack
off, I'm not certain

1706
01:14:38,510 --> 01:14:41,246
that folding is a better
play than calling.

1707
01:14:41,246 --> 01:14:43,370
It's just your odds are
basically good enough here,

1708
01:14:43,370 --> 01:14:45,860
and their range
will be fairly loose

1709
01:14:45,860 --> 01:14:47,522
when I raise from the button.

1710
01:14:47,522 --> 01:14:49,730
Because they're going to
think I don't have much when

1711
01:14:49,730 --> 01:14:50,729
I raise from the button.

1712
01:14:50,729 --> 01:14:52,759
So it's quite
possible calling here

1713
01:14:52,759 --> 01:14:54,050
would have been the right play.

1714
01:14:54,050 --> 01:14:54,960
It's very close.

1715
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:57,980
I think I would definitely
called with ace-nine offsuit.

1716
01:14:57,980 --> 01:15:01,690
I would have definitely
called with king-10 offsuit.

1717
01:15:01,690 --> 01:15:02,690
Yeah, it's pretty close.

1718
01:15:02,690 --> 01:15:03,560
I decided to fold.

1719
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:06,380
Maybe I also knew that
they were kind of tight.

1720
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:08,270
Normally when I play
but I'm not showing here

1721
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:10,870
is I have like statistics
on every player,

1722
01:15:10,870 --> 01:15:13,550
of like overall the hands,
what percent of the time

1723
01:15:13,550 --> 01:15:15,200
they raised, what
percent they folded.

1724
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:18,300
So I have a rough
idea while I'm playing

1725
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:22,320
of how tight everyone is, and
maybe I just knew he was tight.

1726
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:25,202
Actually let me see if I
can turn it back on here.

1727
01:15:25,202 --> 01:15:25,910
Yeah, let me see.

1728
01:15:25,910 --> 01:15:26,760
That might be why.

1729
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:32,060
So OK, so these numbers--

1730
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:33,410
Actually, he's fairly loose.

1731
01:15:33,410 --> 01:15:34,910
Actually, I'm not
sure why I folded.

1732
01:15:34,910 --> 01:15:38,140
So this 10.7 is his
reraise percentage,

1733
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:41,580
and what this says is
10.7% of the time he could

1734
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:44,190
have reraised, he reraised.

1735
01:15:44,190 --> 01:15:48,010
It's only over a sample
of 187 hands, but it's--

1736
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:51,502
Yeah, I think it's definitely
looser than average.

1737
01:15:51,502 --> 01:15:53,210
Although it's a bit
biased, because we're

1738
01:15:53,210 --> 01:15:55,220
playing at a five-handed table.

1739
01:15:55,220 --> 01:15:56,390
Nonetheless, it's close.

1740
01:15:56,390 --> 01:15:59,420
I think calling probably
would've been OK, but I folded.

1741
01:15:59,420 --> 01:16:00,300
Let me turn this off.

1742
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:01,133
It's quite annoying.

1743
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:06,470
So this is near the
final table now.

1744
01:16:06,470 --> 01:16:08,178
This is, I think, the
second final table.

1745
01:16:08,178 --> 01:16:09,970
There's maybe like
11 or 12 left,

1746
01:16:09,970 --> 01:16:11,886
and I'm just going to
show you the final hands

1747
01:16:11,886 --> 01:16:13,460
before the final table.

1748
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:14,630
This hand is a no-brainer.

1749
01:16:14,630 --> 01:16:21,190
We go all in, and fortunately,
we hold against pocket twos.

1750
01:16:21,190 --> 01:16:25,610
OK, so the very last hand,
also fairly no-brainer.

1751
01:16:25,610 --> 01:16:26,810
This guy goes on.

1752
01:16:26,810 --> 01:16:30,080
So yeah, poker is easy if you
just get dealt pocket jacks,

1753
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:31,809
pocket aces all the time.

1754
01:16:31,809 --> 01:16:32,600
So we win this one.

1755
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:35,050
OK so, this is the last
hand before the final table.

1756
01:16:35,050 --> 01:16:38,090
So in a future class, not
the Friday class, because

1757
01:16:38,090 --> 01:16:39,770
Jennifer Shahade is speaking.

1758
01:16:39,770 --> 01:16:42,890
But in a future class I'll
go through the final table,

1759
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:45,650
and I'll maybe also go through
all the hands, not just

1760
01:16:45,650 --> 01:16:48,090
the hands where I
got in a big pot.

1761
01:16:48,090 --> 01:16:51,005
So let me just quickly
go back to the slides.

1762
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:57,987
Right, so I really only
talked about two concepts

1763
01:16:57,987 --> 01:16:58,570
in this class.

1764
01:16:58,570 --> 01:17:02,130
It was this drawy
versus dry boards.

1765
01:17:02,130 --> 01:17:05,060
So try to remember that
while you guys are playing,

1766
01:17:05,060 --> 01:17:06,590
changing your bet
sizing depending

1767
01:17:06,590 --> 01:17:08,060
on the board pressure.

1768
01:17:08,060 --> 01:17:11,152
And also this pre-flop
reraising strategy,

1769
01:17:11,152 --> 01:17:13,110
even though I didn't give
you a conclusion here

1770
01:17:13,110 --> 01:17:15,380
on what you reraise with.

1771
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:17,960
I should give you some rough
guidelines and the advantages

1772
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:20,570
and disadvantages of each play.

1773
01:17:20,570 --> 01:17:22,870
Yeah, OK, cool, so that's it.

1774
01:17:22,870 --> 01:17:24,020
Come on Friday's class.

1775
01:17:24,020 --> 01:17:25,640
It should be really exciting.

1776
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:28,520
Jennifer Shahade, she'll
probably talk a bit about chess

1777
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:30,710
as well, but I'll
convince her not

1778
01:17:30,710 --> 01:17:33,000
to talk too much about chess
when it's a poker class.

1779
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,190
But thanks, guys.
