1
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,090
KRISTEN: So with
that, I am going

2
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:17,980
to turn it off to our first
keynote speaker, Kris Clark.

3
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,130
She also works at Lincoln
Laboratory with me,

4
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,210
but in a completely
different field.

5
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,860
She's going to talk
about space cameras.

6
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,405
KRIS CLARK: So as Kristen
said-- I'm also Kristen,

7
00:00:29,405 --> 00:00:34,280
but I go by Kris-- I work
at Lincoln Laboratory.

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,880
And I want to say that
this is an amazing program.

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,120
So first, how many of you have
ever done a program like this?

10
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,140
Like an engineering
kind of thing for girls.

11
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,040
Come on, way up.

12
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,850
I can't see that.

13
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:46,960
OK, cool.

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,060
Now, how many of
you are freshmen?

15
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,730
Sophomores?

16
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,130
Juniors?

17
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,770
Seniors?

18
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:55,770
All right, no seniors.

19
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,110
They're all busy doing
college applications.

20
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,060
All right, so let's get started.

21
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,644
So today, I'm going to
talk a little bit about me,

22
00:01:02,644 --> 00:01:04,060
just because we're
kind of looking

23
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,935
at what makes an engineer.

24
00:01:06,935 --> 00:01:08,060
It can be all over the map.

25
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,300
So there is no one key picture
of what an engineer looks like,

26
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,067
or what a scientist looks like.

27
00:01:13,067 --> 00:01:15,650
Then we'll go into a little bit
about just really basic stuff,

28
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:16,566
like what is a camera?

29
00:01:16,566 --> 00:01:18,780
What are the key
components of a camera?

30
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,239
And then what can cameras do?

31
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:23,030
And then specifically
I'm going to tell you

32
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,000
about the program I'm
currently working on.

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,270
It is a space camera
looking for as exoplanets.

34
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:31,700
So I'll tell you a little bit
about the specifics of that,

35
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,390
and I have some kind
of cool animation

36
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,515
that they did for me to
show you the orbit, and all

37
00:01:35,515 --> 00:01:37,534
that sort of stuff.

38
00:01:37,534 --> 00:01:38,700
So stop me, raise your hand.

39
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,158
Questions, you don't have to
wait till the end or anything.

40
00:01:41,158 --> 00:01:42,930
So just speak up.

41
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,390
Raise your hand.

42
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,220
Get my attention.

43
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,660
So how I got here.

44
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,580
So you guys all know,
this is Massachusetts.

45
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,890
I did not stray very far.

46
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:53,380
I was born in Worcester in
the center of the state.

47
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,860
I moved to Billerica, Mass
when I was two with my family.

48
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,370
I went to Billerica
Memorial High School.

49
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:04,167
Then I went to MIT for
undergraduate, then to Tufts

50
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:05,000
for graduate school.

51
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,166
So it's kind of this circle.

52
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:08,120
I never went more than
50 miles from home.

53
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,030
And ended up at
Lincoln Laboratory.

54
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,800
I've been there for
the last 12 years

55
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,110
working on space-based
optical systems.

56
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,830
So I have three brothers.

57
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,380
Two of them are
also techie geeks.

58
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,870
One is a lawyer, so he's
kind of the odd man out.

59
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:25,487
But the only time really
that I left the country

60
00:02:25,487 --> 00:02:27,820
was to be an exchange student
for a year in high school.

61
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,778
And other than that,
stayed very close to home.

62
00:02:29,778 --> 00:02:33,230
So there's tons of opportunities
right in your own backyard

63
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,610
for being an engineer.

64
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:39,360
All right, so now I need
some audience participation.

65
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,990
What is a camera?

66
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,480
Anyone want to
take a stab at just

67
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,330
kind of a general
definition of a camera.

68
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,400
Or even just if you're not
really sure how to define it,

69
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,250
maybe just describe
what it does.

70
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,800
That's a good way to start.

71
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,782
AUDIENCE: A device
that takes photos.

72
00:02:57,782 --> 00:02:58,740
KRIS CLARK: Good, good.

73
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,890
Device that take photos.

74
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,200
Anybody want to add to that?

75
00:03:03,762 --> 00:03:05,220
Like a key piece
of information you

76
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,080
can think might
improve the definition

77
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,591
for if you needed to describe
a camera to somebody.

78
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:14,279
AUDIENCE: Light really affects
how the photos [INAUDIBLE].

79
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:16,320
KRIS CLARK: Light affects
how the photo is taken.

80
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,236
Is that what you said?

81
00:03:17,236 --> 00:03:19,251
Yep, so light is very key.

82
00:03:19,251 --> 00:03:21,250
That's pretty much what
we're trying to collect.

83
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,041
Anybody else want to
add to the definition?

84
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,960
Let's see, this is kind
of a generic definition.

85
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,170
A camera is an optical
instrument for recording

86
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,630
or capturing images.

87
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,550
So if you look at
that definition,

88
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,680
really there are
two basic components

89
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,870
you need to a camera.

90
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,090
Does anyone want to take a
guess at one or both of them?

91
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,840
What's the first thing
you have to do when

92
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,964
you want to take a picture?

93
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,790
All right, I'll
give you this one.

94
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,770
Somehow you have to
collect the light, right?

95
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,160
So focus your energy.

96
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,260
It can be visible light.

97
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,040
We'll talk a little bit more
about other types of energy.

98
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,160
But once you have that
light where you want it,

99
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,450
what's the next step?

100
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:05,881
It's there, but what do you
have to do to get a picture?

101
00:04:05,881 --> 00:04:08,120
AUDIENCE: Have
something record it?

102
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,160
KRIS CLARK: Exactly.

103
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,620
So you need a detector.

104
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,200
So basically two components.

105
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,366
You want to get the light
for whatever you're trying

106
00:04:14,366 --> 00:04:16,000
to image to a particular place.

107
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,390
And then you need some sort
of device-- old school,

108
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,890
if you're old school
like me, you've

109
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,042
seen film cameras before.

110
00:04:21,042 --> 00:04:22,250
You took some of those apart.

111
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,820
So film was the detector.

112
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,870
Now, it's much more
the digital age.

113
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,600
You've got CCDs and all
sorts of digital imagers.

114
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,175
So those are basically
the two things

115
00:04:30,175 --> 00:04:31,550
that you have to
do for a camera.

116
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,810
And then from there,
sky's the limit.

117
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,190
There are so many different
types that you can do.

118
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,960
So I thought I'd
start really simply.

119
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,670
Has Anyone ever heard
of a pinhole camera?

120
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:43,136
Anyone ever built
a pinhole camera?

121
00:04:43,136 --> 00:04:44,760
All right, so what's
the basic premise?

122
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,950
Do you remember what the idea
is behind a pinhole camera?

123
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:52,540
AUDIENCE: Yeah, you just put
like little holes in a box.

124
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,360
KRIS CLARK: Yep.

125
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,610
So you have-- let's see if
I can get my little pointer

126
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:58,710
thingy to work-- a tiny,
tiny hole in a dark box.

127
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,660
So there's not even a
lens in this camera.

128
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,310
But that tiny, tiny, tiny
hole is the first half

129
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,560
of what you need for a camera.

130
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,210
Something to collect the light.

131
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:09,190
Now the problem with a pinhole
camera, the tiny, tiny hole

132
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,790
can't collect much light.

133
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:14,240
But it does limit
very specifically

134
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,800
that light from a particular
point in what you're looking at

135
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,070
can only get to a very specific
point on the inside of the box.

136
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:25,270
And so basically, that's your
limiting light collection,

137
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,086
and the back surface of the
box is your image plane.

138
00:05:28,086 --> 00:05:29,460
Now, you can't
really capture it,

139
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,090
because it's just
the back of a box.

140
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,750
But you can look at it, and it's
there if you want to see it.

141
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,504
So very, very primitive.

142
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:38,920
So if we get into some things
that you guys see every day,

143
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,710
and you probably don't
really think a whole lot

144
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:41,670
about how they work.

145
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:45,560
But who would have guessed
how many components

146
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,640
are in that little
tiny phone camera?

147
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,510
That's a lot of stuff.

148
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,570
There's like six
lenses before you even

149
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,030
get to your detector image.

150
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,030
So lots of lenses are used.

151
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:57,700
And we won't talk specifically
about lens design.

152
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,010
But basically, the
fancier cameras

153
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,570
have gotten-- you've noticed,
iPhone cameras always

154
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:07,010
tell you, now our image quality
is improved from iPhone 4

155
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:09,290
to iPhone 6 by whatever percent.

156
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:12,394
It's all about how well you can
correct the light that you're

157
00:06:12,394 --> 00:06:14,310
trying to collect and
get it in the spot where

158
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,560
you want it to be.

159
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,823
And that takes more
and more lenses.

160
00:06:17,823 --> 00:06:19,156
So that gets more sophisticated.

161
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,546
And then you have your
software for image processing.

162
00:06:24,546 --> 00:06:25,920
So you can play
around, like when

163
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,020
you post-- I'm way too old
for this-- but on Instagram

164
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,750
and Twitter, you can
do it color filters

165
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,532
and make it look
kind of different.

166
00:06:32,532 --> 00:06:33,990
That's all in the
image processing,

167
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,390
which you guys will get to do.

168
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,680
Now, I like the
eye as an example,

169
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,870
because you've been using this
camera since you were born.

170
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,700
And pretty much you have a lens.

171
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,010
It focuses the light on
the back of your eye, which

172
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:46,990
is called the retina.

173
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,250
That's your detector.

174
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,084
And then your brain
processes that information

175
00:06:51,084 --> 00:06:51,750
from the retina.

176
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,745
So your brain really is the
image processing software.

177
00:06:54,745 --> 00:06:56,370
And I don't know if
you guys knew this,

178
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:00,020
but if we go back
to-- what do you

179
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:04,120
notice about the image of the
tree in the pinhole camera?

180
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,100
It's upside down, right.

181
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,320
When your eye lens focuses
on the back your retina,

182
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,530
the image is actually
inverted as well.

183
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,170
Your brain fixes that for you.

184
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,910
So this is kind
of a funny thing,

185
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,610
like you're looking at it.

186
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,400
Your lens actually
focuses it upside down,

187
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,290
but your brain knows
that up and down.

188
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:24,280
So kind of an interesting
built in image processing.

189
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,840
So can you guys think of any
other examples of cameras

190
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,200
that you use kind of everyday?

191
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,100
Or maybe not every
day, just specific ones

192
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:36,650
you've heard of maybe
for other applications.

193
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:39,550
You see a camera somewhere else
that you go during the day.

194
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:46,475
Or let's see--

195
00:07:46,475 --> 00:07:49,307
AUDIENCE: I guess a
camera for medical use,

196
00:07:49,307 --> 00:07:51,265
like for surgery so they
can see what's inside.

197
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,190
KRIS CLARK: Yes, exactly.

198
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:59,810
You guys are going to hear about
a really cool medical imaging

199
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,770
camera at lunchtime,
I think one that

200
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,530
detects tumors in patients.

201
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:04,990
So very good example.

202
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,800
Anybody got another
different example

203
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,720
of what cameras are used for?

204
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,864
AUDIENCE: Infrared cameras.

205
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,280
KRIS CLARK: Yep,
infrared cameras.

206
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,890
What do those do?

207
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:14,700
Exactly.

208
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,830
And that brings us
to our next portion.

209
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,540
So when we talk about light, is
anyone familiar with the term

210
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,149
electromagnetic spectrum.

211
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:24,190
You know what that means?

212
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:27,488
Can you describe
it a little bit?

213
00:08:27,488 --> 00:08:32,429
AUDIENCE: It's the frequency--
it's the different scale

214
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,390
for the light [INAUDIBLE].

215
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,980
KRIS CLARK: Exactly right.

216
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:41,020
So most of the time
when you say light,

217
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,570
you think of visible
light, right?

218
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:43,610
What we can see.

219
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:46,150
But really, the
electromagnetic spectrum

220
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:50,580
defines a really large range
of basically electromagnetic

221
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,430
waves.

222
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,870
And this very small
region-- and we kind of

223
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:56,160
define this by
wavelength, how long

224
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,680
is the wavelength of the light?

225
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,040
Most of the stuff we work with
is in this very small spectrum.

226
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,660
But it branches all the way
out here to radio frequencies,

227
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,270
where a wavelength is
the size of a building,

228
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:11,620
all the way out to like gamma
rays, where a wavelength is

229
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,080
like atomic size.

230
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,296
So the big reason probably that
we focus so much on visible,

231
00:09:17,296 --> 00:09:18,420
that's where our eyes work.

232
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,990
That's where we learned
everything from the ground

233
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:24,190
up of how imaging works,
because we didn't have CCDs.

234
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,980
We didn't have film
a long time ago.

235
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,570
We only had eyes and
what we could see.

236
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,310
But now there are
cameras available,

237
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,920
like you said, in infrared.

238
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,430
And I have a little
picture of that.

239
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,590
Take a picture of your dog.

240
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:40,370
So basically it's a
different type of camera.

241
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:43,290
It's collecting infrared light,
which your eyes cannot see,

242
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:46,285
but the particular lenses that
are used to focus this light

243
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:49,590
are specific materials that
are used to focus infrared

244
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,420
wavelengths.

245
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:53,840
And the detector is sensitive
to that range of wavelength

246
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,340
as well.

247
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,930
So when we say we need
a lens and a detector,

248
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,560
it's important to realize
that the materials that

249
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,310
go into those are very
specific to whatever

250
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:06,810
part of the spectrum
you're trying to image.

251
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,670
So there's an awful
lot that goes into it.

252
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:11,650
Some people spend their entire
career on visible systems.

253
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,580
Some people work
entirely in the infrared.

254
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,435
There are whole companies--
FLIR System is all about looking

255
00:10:16,435 --> 00:10:17,450
for infrared.

256
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,988
So their whole business is
built on infrared cameras.

257
00:10:19,988 --> 00:10:21,363
Certainly medical
imaging, right?

258
00:10:21,363 --> 00:10:23,040
You've got x-rays.

259
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,650
So there's tons of
fields, and they

260
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:30,430
can be very specific about
what range they're looking at.

261
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,950
So I threw out some
other examples.

262
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,620
Some of them you
guys already hit on.

263
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:38,650
So here's a little tiny camera
that you can actually swallow.

264
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:42,460
And people can image things
in your digestive tract.

265
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:46,000
It's a little bit creepy to
think about, but it works.

266
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,850
Certainly if you've been to
the airport anytime recently,

267
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:53,520
Homeland Security,
cameras everywhere.

268
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,850
Does anybody know, there's
a specific kind of software

269
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,980
that they can use with
cameras in the airport.

270
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,940
They can do something
very specific

271
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,336
if you're looking for
a particular person.

272
00:11:08,545 --> 00:11:09,670
AUDIENCE: Face recognition?

273
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,170
KRIS CLARK: Face
recognition, right.

274
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,340
So that's part of the image
processing side of things.

275
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,370
There are cameras
very sophisticated

276
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:18,340
that can scan whole crowds.

277
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:21,300
And based on a still image
of a particular person,

278
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,100
they can try and pick
out facial features

279
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,780
by matching the images.

280
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,437
So it's pretty
amazing stuff, when

281
00:11:26,437 --> 00:11:29,020
you think about scanning through
a crowd of hundreds of people

282
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,340
and being able to pick
out a specific person.

283
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:35,040
So traffic regulation, I know
that's a little less exciting.

284
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,050
But they take a picture of
you if you run a red light.

285
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:42,660
I've worked on a
bunch of programs

286
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:47,070
at Lincoln Laboratory
that work to look

287
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:50,080
at various aspects
of weather sensing.

288
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,190
I worked on one that was
made to detect lightning,

289
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,820
because lightning
causes forest fires.

290
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,490
And if you know where the
lightning is going to strike,

291
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:58,050
you can kind of be prepared.

292
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,580
So very specific uses
in weather sensing.

293
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,720
And then of course,
that brings us

294
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,210
to my favorite, space
exploration, which

295
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:08,680
is what I'm working on now.

296
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,250
So now over a broad
reach of examples,

297
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,160
I'm going to talk about
specifically the one for space

298
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,044
applications.

299
00:12:15,044 --> 00:12:17,210
And this is the current
program that I'm working on.

300
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:20,004
I've been working on it
for about four years.

301
00:12:20,004 --> 00:12:21,420
Right from the
very beginning when

302
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,610
we developed the first
prototype camera,

303
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,480
and we've refined it since then.

304
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,310
So I'll tell you
a bit about that.

305
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,610
Has anyone heard of it?

306
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:31,580
Because it actually has
its own Facebook page,

307
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,530
which is unusual
for a lab program,

308
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,270
because it's completely
unclassified,

309
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,371
and it has lots of followers.

310
00:12:37,371 --> 00:12:38,870
The science community
that's looking

311
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:41,564
to use the data from TESS
is all over the world.

312
00:12:41,564 --> 00:12:43,230
Like the test science
community actually

313
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,350
meets down the road at Harvard.

314
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:49,000
And they have people
from all over Europe.

315
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,540
Nobody's heard of it?

316
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,420
OK, so not really surprised.

317
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,990
But I figure Facebook, you
might have happened upon it.

318
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:58,180
So basically, the
goal for TESS--

319
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,290
has anyone heard of Kepler here?

320
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:04,094
So do you know what
Kepler was looking for?

321
00:13:04,094 --> 00:13:05,249
AUDIENCE: Exoplanets?

322
00:13:05,249 --> 00:13:07,290
KRIS CLARK: Yeah, who
knows what an exoplanet is?

323
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:08,754
Anybody?

324
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:11,410
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

325
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,520
KRIS CLARK: Exactly, sorry.

326
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,560
Yeah, it's any planet.

327
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,300
So that's a pretty large field,
because there's only nine--

328
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,600
I still count Pluto.

329
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,362
So any other planet
that you can think of

330
00:13:20,362 --> 00:13:21,320
is called an exoplanet.

331
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,028
So something outside
of our solar system.

332
00:13:23,028 --> 00:13:25,710
So Kepler did look
for exoplanets,

333
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:28,444
and it was kind of the first
one out there to look and see,

334
00:13:28,444 --> 00:13:30,610
well we think there's a lot
of exoplanets out there,

335
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,700
but let's go look at a
specific section of the sky

336
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,500
and make sure, before we
build lots of other missions

337
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,950
to go look for exoplanets
that we're kind of right.

338
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,221
And Kepler did confirm there's
an awful lot of exoplanets

339
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:41,720
to look for.

340
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,810
So along came TESS.

341
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:47,360
TESS's goal is to go up and
spend two years basically

342
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,710
canvassing the
entire sky, looking

343
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:52,060
at specific types of
stars-- sort of red,

344
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:56,810
cooler stars-- to identify
where exoplanets might be.

345
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:00,180
And we do that, it's
very simple, actually.

346
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,110
If you have a star,
and you happen

347
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:05,210
to be looking at it when the
planet's transiting, as it's

348
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:08,279
called-- when it passes in
front of the planet-- what

349
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:10,320
do you think happens if
you're looking at a star,

350
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,420
and you see the
light from the star,

351
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,628
and the planet goes in front?

352
00:14:12,628 --> 00:14:15,660
What do you think
happens to the light?

353
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,660
There's a shadow, right?

354
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,960
So the light is decreased.

355
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,070
And that's really the
whole principle behind TESS

356
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:24,480
is looking for those little
decreases in the light

357
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,394
from the star.

358
00:14:25,394 --> 00:14:27,060
Now, it's got some
very specific things.

359
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,980
You can only see
it if the planet

360
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,970
is kind of orbiting
in front of the star.

361
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,469
If it's going around this way,
you're not going to see that.

362
00:14:33,469 --> 00:14:36,650
So it's a small percentage
of chances to pick it up.

363
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,220
But that's how we're
going to do it.

364
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,820
So I have kind of a cool movie.

365
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,165
Let's see if I can
get this started.

366
00:14:42,165 --> 00:14:43,665
They have some
really good graphics,

367
00:14:43,665 --> 00:14:48,010
the people at the lab that
put this movie together.

368
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,400
So this is the general idea.

369
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,922
The planet's going
around the star.

370
00:14:51,922 --> 00:14:53,380
And then at the
bottom, it'll start

371
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,570
to trace out the light signal.

372
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,780
So there's the
starlight, and then

373
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:01,280
as the planet passes in
front of it, this little dip.

374
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,620
Now, what do you notice when the
planet passes behind the star?

375
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,140
Anybody notice
anything interesting?

376
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:11,720
Like when it passes in front,
the dip is pretty obvious.

377
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,940
But what's the second dip?

378
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,060
Anybody get any ideas?

379
00:15:16,844 --> 00:15:21,030
AUDIENCE: Well, I just noticed
as it goes around the star,

380
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:24,450
the line goes up a little bit.

381
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,960
KRIS CLARK: Yep,
so somehow we're

382
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,500
getting a little
more light signal.

383
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,080
What do you think that is?

384
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,480
AUDIENCE: Reflection from the
star on the on the planet?

385
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,960
KRIS CLARK: Exactly, exactly.

386
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,660
So if you think of a star
as emitting radiation

387
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:43,300
in all directions, we're seeing
the stuff coming toward us.

388
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,710
But as the planet
passes behind the star,

389
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,920
some of the light that would
be going backwards gets

390
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,360
reflected forwards, and then
you get this kind of increase

391
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,530
in your light curve.

392
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,642
So this is called the
characteristic light curve.

393
00:15:54,642 --> 00:15:56,350
So if there were no
planet, it would just

394
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,450
be pretty much a constant line.

395
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:02,009
And what TESS is doing is
looking for these little blips.

396
00:16:02,009 --> 00:16:03,550
And they call it
periodic, because it

397
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:08,520
happens kind of-- everyone
know what periodic means?

398
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,120
And the problem is,
depending on what star

399
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,430
you're looking at, if it's a
small planet, what do you think

400
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:16,240
happens to this if the
planet gets bigger?

401
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:19,862
Anybody?

402
00:16:19,862 --> 00:16:21,350
AUDIENCE: The dip gets deeper?

403
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,980
KRIS CLARK: The dip get steeper.

404
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,110
Now, we're trying to look
for Earth-like planets.

405
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,940
And if you think
of Earth compared

406
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:30,970
to other planets in our solar
system, what size are we?

407
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:34,237
Like compared to
Jupiter, we're small.

408
00:16:34,237 --> 00:16:35,820
So Jupiter is easy
to find, because it

409
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,950
reflects a lot of light,
it blocks a lot of light.

410
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:41,120
But the smaller you get, and
Earth is relatively small,

411
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,260
the smaller that dip is.

412
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,940
So TESS really needs to
detect-- it's about 1%

413
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:49,120
variation in this very
bright signal from a star.

414
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,180
So that's the
challenge for TESS.

415
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,327
Just to show you a little bit
about where TESS is orbiting--

416
00:16:55,327 --> 00:16:57,660
and there's a movie, so I
won't spend too long in here--

417
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,400
but basically, here's Earth.

418
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,570
TESS goes out really far.

419
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,440
Like 60 Earth-radius far.

420
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,510
Beyond the moon.

421
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:07,270
So they call this
highly elliptical.

422
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,020
And that's for a lot
of different reasons,

423
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,720
that primarily it's a very
thermally-stable orbit,

424
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,640
so the temperature
stays the same.

425
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,920
And that's one of
many variables that go

426
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,819
into designing space cameras.

427
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:20,460
You have to be aware
of the environment

428
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,050
that your camera is
going to live in.

429
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:25,619
If you design a camera that
works in your laboratory

430
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:29,360
at like 20 degrees
Celsius or 70 Fahrenheit,

431
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,420
then you transcend it the
space where it's minus 80,

432
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,620
might not work out so well.

433
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,930
So some of the important
considerations.

434
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:41,370
And what TESS does is it
has two orbits per month

435
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:44,510
that it stares at a very
particular section of the sky.

436
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,900
And we have four
cameras aligned,

437
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,240
so we get a very
wide field of view.

438
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,364
So we kind of go like this.

439
00:17:48,364 --> 00:17:52,747
There's four cameras, and
it's almost 100 degrees.

440
00:17:52,747 --> 00:17:54,330
And it stares at a
section of the sky.

441
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,970
And then after a
month, it moves.

442
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:59,340
And basically, it scans
out the entire sky.

443
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,010
So TESS is going to
look at not 100%.

444
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:05,170
You can see have a few open
areas near the equator.

445
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:08,430
But about 95% of the sky,
we'll be looking and watching

446
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,940
for exoplanets.

447
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:14,186
So this movie shows it much
better than I can describe it.

448
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,220
So you can see the Moon
orbiting the Earth.

449
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,480
And you can see TESS goes
around the Earth twice

450
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,070
for every time the moon does.

451
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,020
And in fact, the
moon-- I don't know

452
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,770
a lot about orbital
mechanics, but I do

453
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:35,570
know that in the process of
getting to that final orbit,

454
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,820
there's about three different
orbits that it gradually

455
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,170
gets further and further out
till it gets that final orbit.

456
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,040
And it uses the moon
and gravitational pull

457
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,810
from the moon to hit to
get out to that last highly

458
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:45,560
elliptical orbit.

459
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,890
So there's a whole lot
of interesting science

460
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,400
just to get TESS
where it needs to go.

461
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,090
So now that TESS is on
its orbit, you'll watch.

462
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:56,940
And that outline
here, that's the field

463
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,780
of view of each of the cameras.

464
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,250
So there's four
cameras in a row.

465
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,160
And it scans out.

466
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,270
That's one month at a time
that it's scanning out.

467
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:10,494
Now, what do you
notice about this part?

468
00:19:10,494 --> 00:19:11,410
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

469
00:19:14,792 --> 00:19:15,500
KRIS CLARK: Yeah.

470
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,110
So this is what we call the
continuous coverage zone.

471
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:20,930
So in the attempt to
see the entire sky,

472
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,390
there's going to
be some overlap.

473
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:28,999
So basically at the poles, we
see almost full-year coverage.

474
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:30,790
Now we're going to the
Southern hemisphere,

475
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,990
this is year two of the mission.

476
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:36,180
Same thing, we're going to
scan out the entire sky.

477
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:41,790
And we get almost full,
continuous coverage

478
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,220
at the poles.

479
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:46,640
And so not by chance,
the follow-on mission.

480
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,550
Has anyone heard of James
Webb Space Telescope?

481
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:53,130
It's looking up here.

482
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,880
So one of TESS's
goals is to provide

483
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,202
basically a catalog of just
thousands of places to go look.

484
00:19:59,202 --> 00:20:00,660
Say, go look at
this star, we think

485
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,670
there's an exoplanet there.

486
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,211
Than James Webb
doesn't have to spend

487
00:20:03,211 --> 00:20:04,940
a lot of time looking for them.

488
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,870
It knows exactly where to look.

489
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:10,917
And James Webb is going up
there to-- I have the picture.

490
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:12,000
It's a little bit further.

491
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,520
So James Webb is
going up there and is

492
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,270
going to have a target
planet, and go look

493
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,890
at the atmosphere
of that planet.

494
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:19,550
So TESS is really just
designed to find planets.

495
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,840
It can't really
characterize planets.

496
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,190
James Webb can go up and
look at the atmospherics

497
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,941
of the planets in
question and determine

498
00:20:26,941 --> 00:20:27,940
is it really like Earth?

499
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:28,570
Is it hotter?

500
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:29,360
Is it colder?

501
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,693
You know, what's the atmosphere?

502
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,860
All right, so since you guys
have already ripped apart

503
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,776
cameras and are going
to be building your own,

504
00:20:37,776 --> 00:20:41,360
I figured I'd show you kind of
the insides of the TESS camera.

505
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,560
So we identified
our two key pieces.

506
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,670
Now, this is basically
a section view.

507
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:51,680
So there's an awful lot of
stuff going on in there.

508
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:56,520
But basically, this whole back
end section is our detector.

509
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,670
This front end
section is our lens.

510
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:02,760
And anybody have any
guesses at some of the stuff

511
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,710
you can see in the back
behind the detector?

512
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,700
Anybody recognize
anything back there?

513
00:21:10,914 --> 00:21:12,580
Because you're going
to see some of this

514
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,430
stuff a little bit later.

515
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:17,510
So detector's pretty much made
up-- you have your CCD, right?

516
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,170
That's your silicon active area.

517
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:21,380
But you need some electronics
behind it, too, right?

518
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,130
So you guys are going
to see that when you

519
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:24,530
build your Raspberry Pi camera.

520
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:27,116
You can see the electronics
that actually pull the image in,

521
00:21:27,116 --> 00:21:29,240
and then you're going to
do your signal processing.

522
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,670
For TESS, that's all
done on this back end.

523
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:37,505
Now I am much more-- I'm
a physicist by degree,

524
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:38,880
but my whole career
has basically

525
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,170
been on lens design
and lens test.

526
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:44,220
So this is really
more my sweet spot.

527
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,914
This lens, we can characterize
it a few different ways.

528
00:21:47,914 --> 00:21:49,330
So there's seven
different lenses.

529
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:51,750
So that tells you
there's an awful lot that

530
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,490
goes into this,
because we're looking

531
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:57,090
at a very specific band.

532
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:59,150
And so that drives how
many lenses we need

533
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,790
and what materials that
need to be made out of.

534
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:04,540
And we have to
match our detector.

535
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,790
Because if we image light
and then use a detector

536
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:10,180
that isn't very sensitive to
that particular wavelength

537
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,600
of light, not going to
get a very good image.

538
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,780
But there is one thing I
wanted to stress about TESS.

539
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:18,959
So your phone takes really
nice, clear pictures,

540
00:22:18,959 --> 00:22:20,750
and you can take pictures
with your friends

541
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,874
and they're nice and clear.

542
00:22:21,874 --> 00:22:23,450
TESS is not that kind of camera.

543
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:25,480
So if you think about
what TESS is trying to do,

544
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,540
it's trying to look at a
very wide field of view,

545
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,900
a huge area.

546
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,382
And does anyone
know what typically

547
00:22:31,382 --> 00:22:33,090
happens when you have
a camera and you're

548
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:36,450
trying to look at a very wide
field of view with a camera?

549
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:40,960
What do you notice about
the edges of the picture?

550
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,410
Has anyone ever seen a very
wide field of the image?

551
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,530
Trying to think
of a good example.

552
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:52,480
An old school camera,
an old school photo.

553
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,850
The edges of the image are
not as good as the center.

554
00:22:55,850 --> 00:23:00,240
So if you are trying
to optimize your camera

555
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,140
to look at a very specific
spot, you can do really

556
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,930
well in one place,
but the further

557
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:07,210
you expand your field
of view basically,

558
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:10,560
it's hard to keep the entire
field of view in focus.

559
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,810
And so TESS is not really
concerned about taking

560
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:14,680
really pretty, sharp images.

561
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,910
All it needs to
do is-- basically,

562
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:18,090
we call it a light bucket.

563
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:20,130
It's trying to collect
the light from the stars

564
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:24,730
in a small enough spot that we
can notice that little change

565
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,340
in the light curve.

566
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,720
So it's kind of a totally
different type of camera.

567
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,550
It's not a pretty
pictures camera.

568
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,790
It's a light collection camera.

569
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:35,630
And the other key
thing to think about

570
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:37,810
when you're designing
a camera, so what

571
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:39,240
are you trying to do with it?

572
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,650
But also, where are
you trying to do that?

573
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,770
So TESS is going to operate.

574
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:47,630
We design it on the ground
at a normal temperature

575
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:48,740
for you and me.

576
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,530
But there's a lot
of adjustments that

577
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,960
have to go into the
design to make sure

578
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,420
that when it's up in
space and really cold,

579
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,140
that it will
operate as intended.

580
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,270
So there's a lot that goes
into the camera design.

581
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,890
It's not just what
you're going to do,

582
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:03,264
but where you're
trying to do it.

583
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,610
And so this is where TESS fits
into the exoplanet puzzle.

584
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:10,830
We talked a little
bit about this before.

585
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,697
So I wanted to put
these pictures in,

586
00:24:12,697 --> 00:24:14,280
because they look
so different, right?

587
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,310
So this is what
Kepler looked like.

588
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:18,670
It was looking at a very
specific section of sky.

589
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:20,170
So it was doing
something different.

590
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:22,620
It was looking at a very
narrow field of view,

591
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,730
and very specific planets.

592
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:27,220
TESS, you've seen
we've got four cameras.

593
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:30,810
And our goal is to just go up
there and find planets, but not

594
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:32,320
really characterize them.

595
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,760
And then James Webb looks
totally different than we do.

596
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,410
It's got multiple instruments
on the same spacecraft,

597
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:43,010
and it's going up there, and
it can actually characterize

598
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:44,430
the atmospheres of the planet.

599
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:46,700
So we get one step
closer to finding out

600
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,665
if there really is another
Earth-like planet up in space.

601
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,140
All right, so just
to kind of close out.

602
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,770
So we've talked about a
bunch of different cameras.

603
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:57,400
And one thing I want
to stress, they're

604
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,840
used in so many
different fields.

605
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,490
Even if you don't want to
be a camera designer, just

606
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:04,800
understanding how they work
and how different things affect

607
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,320
them can be useful to you in
so many different fields now.

608
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,390
Because even if
you're into something

609
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:12,960
that's not really
super technical,

610
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,560
you might end up using cameras.

611
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,260
And so I think no matter
what you choose to do,

612
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,270
it's nice to have that
ability and to really

613
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:20,760
understand how they function.

614
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,510
But if you do
really get into it,

615
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:24,550
there's an awful lot
of different areas

616
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:26,530
that you could
really focus on and I

617
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:30,380
think make a huge
difference in your field.

618
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:36,530
So what you can do with cameras
right now is have some fun.

619
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:38,360
So I hope you guys
have a great day,

620
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,390
and I hope you have fun
building the cameras

621
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:46,140
and figuring out if maybe
optical engineering or detector

622
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,300
or signal processing
is your passion.

623
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,740
So good luck with
the rest of the day.

624
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:54,390
[APPLAUSE]
