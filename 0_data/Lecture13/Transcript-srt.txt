00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,520
GARY GENSLER: Today we're
going to dive into a topic that

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,400
is relevant to all of us right
now, is the coronavirus crisis.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,550
And for those watching in
the future these recordings,

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,030
we'll see how many of these
predictions might come true.

8
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:31,040
But we're going to
try to sort of frame

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,710
fintech in this crisis.

10
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,750
And it's both a health care
crisis and an economic crisis.

11
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,820
I thought that I would
spend a little bit of time

12
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:45,020
in this class talking about some
financial crises in the past.

13
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:50,366
I'll talk about the 2008
crisis more specifically.

14
00:00:50,366 --> 00:00:53,150
We'll take a look at some
of the economic forecasts

15
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:57,662
here in May of 2020.

16
00:00:57,662 --> 00:00:59,580
And of course those
looking in the future

17
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,010
will sort of look back and
say, aha, was it better

18
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:02,850
or was it worse?

19
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,680
I have some points
of view about that,

20
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,140
and I'll share those openly.

21
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,920
And then we'll sort
of finalize about what

22
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,950
this means for fintech and some
of the sectors and subsectors

23
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,140
within the space.

24
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:23,850
So with that, I am going
to try to share some slides

25
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,920
and get going.

26
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:37,720
So that's the overview of
what we're going to try to do.

27
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,340
And looking a little bit
at crises, the '08 crisis,

28
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:45,850
as I said, grounded in
what's happening today.

29
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:50,180
I'm glad to take questions
at any point in time.

30
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:55,080
This is a little bit
more relevant today,

31
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:00,180
but it's also much
broader than just fintech.

32
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,880
Some of the readings
were around what's

33
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,420
happening in financial
technology, the interviews

34
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,340
that TechCrunch put out
of eight top fintech VCs

35
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,880
and what they were saying.

36
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,250
I will also close this
discussion with something

37
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:24,250
that Boston Consulting Group
just put out in May of 2020.

38
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,620
So just a few
questions to get going

39
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,910
and see if Romain has a little
fun with calling on folks.

40
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:35,079
But how's the coronavirus
crisis affecting

41
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:37,630
the financial services
world more broadly?

42
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:42,290
Not fintech, but the financial
services world more broadly.

43
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:45,670
And though it wasn't in
the readings, many of you

44
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:48,820
are studying finance and are
from the world of finance.

45
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,460
So these could be just your
personal opinions, of course.

46
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:58,180
TEACHING ASSISTANT:
Good morning, everyone.

47
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,870
Come on, this is one of your
last opportunities to shine.

48
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,170
Olivia, you have the floor.

49
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,990
AUDIENCE: So with
the stock market

50
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:13,050
sort of tanking in
the past few months,

51
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:19,160
that would impact any business
that manages financial assets.

52
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:26,520
So mutual funds,
hedge funds, the like,

53
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,210
the vast majority
of them probably

54
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:35,340
have their asset base
declining in a similar way.

55
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,520
They're all working
remote as well.

56
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,410
So you could think of
ways that might impact

57
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:47,490
other financial services
companies that maybe are not

58
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:52,410
quite as technologically
savvy as other sectors.

59
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:56,023
But basically any business--

60
00:03:56,023 --> 00:03:56,940
it could be insurance.

61
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,520
It could be banking--

62
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,820
will have to revalue
the assets that they

63
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,670
hold on their balance sheets.

64
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,830
GARY GENSLER: So can I
pause just for a second

65
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,500
because you mentioned
about four or five

66
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,330
really important things.

67
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:16,769
One is the volatility and
that financial services really

68
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:21,740
stands, in our economies,
as managing and helping

69
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,680
the economy more
broadly manage risk.

70
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,510
Taking in risk and transferring
that risk and pricing risk.

71
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:32,690
But the volatility
itself has come along.

72
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,040
Now, some firms will fail.

73
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,030
Some firms won't.

74
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,880
When I was at Goldman
Sachs, there was a saying--

75
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,438
I didn't create the saying-- is
that volatility was our friend.

76
00:04:41,438 --> 00:04:43,730
Well, it was our friend if
we could manage it well, not

77
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,640
if we stumbled along the way.

78
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,760
But financial firms are
often in the business

79
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,890
of managing risk, whether
they're insurance companies,

80
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,750
investment banks, and the like.

81
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,830
So that's one thing that
Olivia has mentioned.

82
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,750
But she's also mentioned assets.

83
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,540
And in two different ways,
I just want to highlight.

84
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:06,290
Assets under management for
the wealth management or asset

85
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:09,560
management field
has shrunk a bit.

86
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,020
And so to the extent
that BlackRock

87
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,360
used to be maybe $7
trillion of assets

88
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,750
and maybe it's $6 trillion
or $6 going to $5,

89
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,550
that's fewer assets
under management.

90
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,230
But also I think
the second piece

91
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:25,070
that Olivia mentioned is
really critical, is valuing

92
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,840
those assets,
particularly, let's say

93
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,820
you were in a commercial
banking field,

94
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,180
or you were in a fintech
field making loans.

95
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,970
The actual loan side
of the balance sheet,

96
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:39,080
you're seeing that commercial
bank after commercial bank

97
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,310
is taking losses on those
loans in anticipation

98
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:46,080
of the delinquencies and
defaults that will come.

99
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,350
So that's a revaluation
of their loan portfolio,

100
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,980
and is likely to continue.

101
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:55,310
I think I saw Danielle's hand
up as well maybe in there.

102
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,600
TEACHING ASSISTANT:
Yes, and then Adam.

103
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,360
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I was going
to say one of the other trends

104
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,148
is a change in the pace of
investment into fintech firms.

105
00:06:05,148 --> 00:06:06,690
That's probably
similar to what we're

106
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:09,330
seeing across the
investing portfolio,

107
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:12,750
but people are struggling
with finding places

108
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,660
to invest with the
new remote operations,

109
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,630
as well as fintech firms
pivoting and looking more

110
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:19,950
internally.

111
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,750
And within the
venture capital space,

112
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,310
there's been some reports of
investors advising startups

113
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,660
just to focus more on their
core business operations,

114
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:32,040
scale back auxiliary functions,
and generally have a return

115
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,450
to core business.

116
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,409
GARY GENSLER: So let's
just take those two.

117
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:38,710
And we're going to dive all
the way into all of these,

118
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:45,240
but one is basically that the
funding, the funding coming

119
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,800
in to fintech and the venture
capital firms to themselves,

120
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,330
these two married
points, are really

121
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,580
looking at things differently.

122
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,460
That the companies need to
look at their operations

123
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,440
and look at core operations.

124
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,350
And we'll talk a lot about
that, whether it's in fintech

125
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:04,410
or more broadly in the
economy, that companies

126
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:07,410
that were being funded by
the venture capital field

127
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:11,190
generally are not yet
cash flow positive.

128
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:16,200
Some are, when they're at
series C or D or even E rounds.

129
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,140
But certainly early
in their lives,

130
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,110
they generally are
cash flow negative.

131
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,000
And so how much
runway they have,

132
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,120
how much time they
have, in essence,

133
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,260
to turn the corner to get cash
flow positive and profitable.

134
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:37,080
And of course the venture field
itself is being more cautious,

135
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,270
and so funding is slowing now.

136
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,380
You said Adam was also one of--

137
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,183
TEACHING ASSISTANT: Yep, Adam.

138
00:07:44,183 --> 00:07:45,350
AUDIENCE: Hey, good morning.

139
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:49,340
So my point, not
necessarily related closely

140
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,820
to fintech, but certainly
an important trend

141
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,170
in financial services.

142
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:58,850
So I'm into commodities,
and I'm working on a paper

143
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:02,400
with Professor Mirkin
regarding oil prices.

144
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,610
GARY GENSLER: Adam, do you
mind turning on your video

145
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,970
so we're with you?

146
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:09,860
AUDIENCE: The thing is I
won't be able to see you then.

147
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,450
That's why--

148
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:13,660
GARY GENSLER: Oh, all
right, so let's keep going.

149
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,830
AUDIENCE: So since you can't
just stop producing oil,

150
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,930
like most of the
valves in the US

151
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,360
and across the globe,
the way it's structured,

152
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,730
it's not a switch
that you can shut off.

153
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:28,670
And I'm sure all of you know
we don't drive as much now,

154
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:31,630
and we don't go outside.

155
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:34,870
Airlines obviously don't operate
with the same capacity they did

156
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,490
before, so we don't use oil.

157
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:39,400
But on the other end, we still
produce almost the same amount

158
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,558
of oil than before.

159
00:08:41,558 --> 00:08:48,580
Oil prices took a major, major
hit, forcing a lot of valves

160
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,650
to shut down, probably
for good, just

161
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,470
because it's not necessarily
possible to reopen

162
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,760
smaller valves.

163
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,940
And I think the
whole energy sector,

164
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:05,626
if this goes on for a bit
longer, might be completely--

165
00:09:05,626 --> 00:09:07,590
the way it was
before coronavirus,

166
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,440
it will be completely new after.

167
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,550
Because a lot of
players were forced out.

168
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:21,703
The US's place as the biggest
oil exporter might change.

169
00:09:21,703 --> 00:09:23,370
GARY GENSLER: So can
we circle that back

170
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,140
to financial services?

171
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:29,680
What you're saying is
the commodity field,

172
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,940
the commodity sector
is taking quite a hit.

173
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,410
There's a demand shock.

174
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:37,040
It's been one of the most
serious demand shocks

175
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,330
that we've seen in
several decades,

176
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,940
one might even say
in a hundred years,

177
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:51,630
on energy and on many
other physical commodities

178
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:57,120
in the energy and in the metals
space, less so in agriculture.

179
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,790
And so that demand shock
has led to a price shock.

180
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:03,840
We've also had a bit of
a scuffle between Russia

181
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,210
and Saudi Arabia in terms of
oil production and the like.

182
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:11,220
And so how does that circle
back to the financial services

183
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,100
field, in your mind, Adam?

184
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,652
Sort of a brief--

185
00:10:15,652 --> 00:10:19,740
AUDIENCE: I follow, as you know
others look into the fields

186
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,650
that they are interested
in, follow a lot of funds,

187
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:28,740
hedge funds, specialized funds
in energy, commodities space.

188
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,552
And a lot of these
players took major hits.

189
00:10:31,552 --> 00:10:33,260
GARY GENSLER: All
right, so what's your--

190
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:38,310
AUDIENCE: And some of the
biggest companies in energy

191
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:42,620
is Zimmer Partners, with
like a 25-year track

192
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:47,400
preferred of over 20%
average return annually,

193
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,860
so pretty impressive firm.

194
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,180
[INAUDIBLE] reported a 55%
loss in the first quarter.

195
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:59,110
And they are among the most
renowned funds in the sector.

196
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,990
GARY GENSLER: So
if I can bring it--

197
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,610
Adam, can I just bring it short?

198
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,340
Because we don't
have a lot of time.

199
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,580
Let me just shorten it up.

200
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,040
What you're saying is there's
a commodity price shock.

201
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,880
It's moving into a demand
shock, a price shock,

202
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,830
and it's moving into
financial services

203
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,380
with returns for the
asset managers and hedge

204
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,495
funds in the commodity space.

205
00:11:19,495 --> 00:11:20,910
Did I capture it?

206
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,560
AUDIENCE: Yeah, absolutely.

207
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,590
GARY GENSLER: Thank you.

208
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:29,920
So we've talked a little
bit about how it's also

209
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,370
hitting towards fintech itself.

210
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:38,230
Some of the funding side, we're
going to go into that more.

211
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,880
But what about the
positive trends?

212
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,510
Are there any positive trends
likely to emerge out of this

213
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,205
for financial technology firms?

214
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,490
TEACHING ASSISTANT: Ivy, would
you like to give it a shot?

215
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:53,810
AUDIENCE: Yeah, sure.

216
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:57,800
So I think there's
definitely going to be

217
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,300
winners and losers from here.

218
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,370
So previously, as
we know, there's

219
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:04,850
been a huge emergence
in terms of fintech

220
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,230
across all these spaces.

221
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:09,270
And a lot of them
are not profitable.

222
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,420
And so I think
the positive trend

223
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:15,740
is that firms with, I think,
disciplined underwriting as

224
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,540
well as actually a
working business model

225
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:21,260
will emerge from this
unscathed-- not unscathed,

226
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:24,080
but probably gaining more
market share and doubling down.

227
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,180
So I actually think
that's a positive,

228
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,060
I think, for just
the general market

229
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,370
because it is a
little oversaturated.

230
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:34,070
GARY GENSLER: So
Ivy's highlighted

231
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:36,260
it's a highly saturated field.

232
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:39,980
But for those who have a
truly viable business model,

233
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,290
that may play to
their advantage.

234
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:46,130
We're also going to talk about
various sectors that might play

235
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:47,840
to their advantage as well.

236
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,280
And I think there
is another hand up.

237
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,750
TEACHING ASSISTANT: Hassan?

238
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,630
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
so, for instance,

239
00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:00,310
I can talk about my
country, Bahrain.

240
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:06,830
With this pandemic, I've
noticed that people who are not

241
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:12,070
used to fintech technologies
have not gotten used to it,

242
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:16,440
and they're taking advantage
of these kind of services.

243
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:23,990
So I think that even after
this pandemic is over,

244
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,070
behavior has changed forever.

245
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,270
So this is my take on it.

246
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,062
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

247
00:13:28,062 --> 00:13:29,960
So it accentuates trends.

248
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:34,570
We've already been over the
last three-ish, four decades

249
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:39,350
digitizing the economies, but
not uniformly around the globe.

250
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:43,790
And so this accentuates
that trend to digitization,

251
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:48,950
and it accentuates a trend
towards online commerce.

252
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:52,230
And in both of those trends,
they were happening already.

253
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:55,610
But I think Hassan's raised
a really important point.

254
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,950
It accelerates some
of those trends.

255
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:01,490
And those will create
opportunities and challenges,

256
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:04,580
and there will be winners and
losers, as we talked about.

257
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:08,030
So I'm going to sort of dive in.

258
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:11,950
Financial sector
crises are not new.

259
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:16,420
This is just sort of
a sampling of a list.

260
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:20,360
And even in 2008, we were
followed by European debt

261
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,660
crisis in 2009 and 2012.

262
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:29,600
And so the question will be
is not just this crisis, 2020.

263
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,070
Is it to '21?

264
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,620
Is it to 2022?

265
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,900
Does it have
aftershocks beyond that?

266
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:39,200
I'm here to say it's not
just the 2020 crisis.

267
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,720
But I think you all
knew that already.

268
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,960
But I'm also going to say that
finance, by its very nature,

269
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:52,740
tends to have crises
every five, 10, 15 years.

270
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,270
And each time, people will
have some conversation

271
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,960
about this is the worst
crisis in 50 or 100 years.

272
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,650
So it seems like we get the
once-in-a-50-year crisis every

273
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,990
5 to 15 years.

274
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:12,240
And in your careers, you will
probably see five or six more.

275
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,140
Now, God willing, they won't
be driven by a pandemic,

276
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:19,740
and there won't be millions
of people or hundreds

277
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:24,090
of millions of people put out
of work through a lockdown

278
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:27,510
to protect ourselves
against a virus.

279
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:32,020
But you will see other
financial crises along the way.

280
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:32,650
I have.

281
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:37,410
I didn't work in the 1970s,
but from the 1980s on.

282
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:41,810
And some were more severe
than others, of course.

283
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,680
The financial crisis in
'08-- just to remind you.

284
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,750
We're not going to
dive in deeply--

285
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,260
weak underwriting, a
lot of easy credit,

286
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:54,490
poor risk management, and
then multiple failures around.

287
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:58,300
This is what was
called systemic risk.

288
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:03,390
Emanating first out of the
US and the housing markets,

289
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:08,460
and the housing markets
had an asset bubble.

290
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,260
But it was also true in Spain.

291
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,450
It was also true in
other European countries.

292
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:15,880
It was not only
isolated to the US.

293
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,670
But in a financial sense--
not in a health care sense,

294
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,500
but in a financial sense--

295
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,500
we Americans and a couple
other markets like Spain

296
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,320
and elsewhere sort
of propagated out

297
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:32,200
to other markets a contagion, if
you wish, a financial contagion

298
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,800
to the rest of the world.

299
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,990
Now, some countries like China,
Australia, Canada sort of

300
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:40,330
weathered the
financial storm well,

301
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:43,570
but they were still hit
with an economic shock.

302
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,970
You couldn't avoid
it, in a sense,

303
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:50,230
because we're so interconnected
economically around the globe.

304
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:53,860
And what was the result after
that crisis, just for a moment?

305
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,720
There was financial reform.

306
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,950
Around the globe, primarily
in Europe, Canada, Australia,

307
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:03,760
the US, Japan had
to put in place

308
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,180
a stronger set of regulations.

309
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:11,829
It didn't change the fundamental
basic regulatory environment,

310
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:15,490
but more capital, more shock
absorbers within the banking

311
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:18,880
sector, more transparency
in the derivatives

312
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,117
markets, and the like.

313
00:17:21,117 --> 00:17:23,160
TEACHING ASSISTANT: Gary,
I think I recognize you

314
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,608
on this picture, no?

315
00:17:24,608 --> 00:17:26,026
GARY GENSLER: All
right, so where?

316
00:17:26,026 --> 00:17:28,098
Where, Romain?]

317
00:17:28,098 --> 00:17:30,450
TEACHING ASSISTANT:
In the front row?

318
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:35,070
GARY GENSLER: Oh, you mean
the center, bald head?

319
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,860
No, it's just a
little light hearted.

320
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,990
We could have done a poll
and asked how many people

321
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:39,920
think that's me?

322
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,720
But I'm sorry to let you down.

323
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,310
That's Ben Bernanke,
the chairman

324
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,830
of the Federal Reserve.

325
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:50,400
I think I am in the
bottom right-hand corner.

326
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,992
So I think I'm sort of not in
the front row with the chairman

327
00:17:53,992 --> 00:17:54,950
of the Federal Reserve.

328
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:59,180
I think I was in about the third
row, as my memory serves me.

329
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,605
But thank you.

330
00:18:01,605 --> 00:18:02,480
For those who don't--

331
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,540
I was honored to be chair of
the Commodity Futures Trading

332
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,790
Commission at the time.

333
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,680
That set of reforms--

334
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,970
that set of reforms, I give
you here a four-year-old chart

335
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,930
out of a law firm,
Davis Polk, that

336
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:18,050
kept track of these things.

337
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:22,490
But those Dodd-Frank reforms
were around transparency

338
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:26,830
in the derivatives markets,
asset-backed securitizations,

339
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:30,740
the sort of resiliency
of banking itself,

340
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:35,740
and a lot about consumer
protection, mortgage market

341
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:40,280
reforms, and the like,
and systemic risk.

342
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,740
And so this just
gives you a sense

343
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,930
of all the different
slip streams

344
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:46,210
that came out of that reform.

345
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:52,330
Many people would say
that that crisis started

346
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:53,740
in the financial sector.

347
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,960
It's not quite true.

348
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,280
It was the housing
sector and asset

349
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,520
bubble in the housing
sector, easy credit,

350
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,360
and certainly the financial
sector was at the center of it.

351
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,560
But it's the mix of housing,
finance, and frankly

352
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,850
a failure in Washington
and in London

353
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:17,600
and elsewhere to stay abreast
and help regulate the market.

354
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,660
So a failure in
the capital markets

355
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:23,440
and in finance, but also
a failure in public policy

356
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:29,650
that got behind and loosened
relation to finance.

357
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:33,720
We're living in a different
set of crises now, I would say.

358
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,460
Fintech, fertile ground.

359
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:41,530
We've talked about this for
the whole 10 classes we've had.

360
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:44,800
But in the midst of
the corona crisis,

361
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,090
I think four of the fertile
grounds that we've already

362
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,760
talked about are accentuated.

363
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,230
Digitization of money.

364
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,810
We still have paper money.

365
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:01,860
I think we're going to
move even faster on this.

366
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,460
What's an interesting thing
in the last seven weeks,

367
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,320
the US Federal
Reserve has actually

368
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,780
continued to issue paper money.

369
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:13,170
Paper money has grown
not significantly,

370
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:18,290
but it's grown close to
4% or 5% in outstanding.

371
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:20,020
Now, that might be
a flight to quality.

372
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,630
It might even be drug
runners who want paper money.

373
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,050
Wide acceptance of new tech.

374
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:30,620
I think that we already
were realistically

375
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:37,070
in a mobile phone, mobile
delivery user interface.

376
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,320
But I think that's accentuated.

377
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,360
I think we've
accentuated these trends

378
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,970
about large pools of
data and the value

379
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:46,150
of those pools of data.

380
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:50,340
So what do we see in terms
of fintech incumbents

381
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,600
and the big tech?

382
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,850
Well, big finance
we've talked about.

383
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:56,730
Huge volumes in the capital
markets, government debt

384
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:57,840
markets.

385
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,800
They're working on these
stimulus loan programs.

386
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,980
And they've also boosted
their allocations

387
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,430
of loan loss reserves.

388
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:10,020
I think we're still
six to 18 months away

389
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,790
from significant delinquencies.

390
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:14,920
In the corporate sector and
the leveraged loan marketplace,

391
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,590
we'll see some of those earlier.

392
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:20,730
The high-yield debt market,
small business loan market,

393
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:22,680
we'll see those in 2020.

394
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:27,970
I think in the household
sector, we'll peak in 2021.

395
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:29,170
I could be wrong.

396
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:31,420
And when people are listening
to this in the future,

397
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,440
they're going to look back and
say, boy, he took some risks.

398
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,190
But I'm willing to
take some risks where I

399
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,570
think there's some challenges.

400
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:42,100
I think also big finance is
very reliant on connectivity.

401
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,730
These trading floors-- if
you went into a trading floor

402
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:48,610
in London or New York,
you would see hundreds

403
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:50,770
of people on a trading floor.

404
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:52,870
And now they're dispersed.

405
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:56,950
And the New York Stock Exchange
went to electronic trading.

406
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:01,480
Will they ever even come back
with physical market makers

407
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,450
on a floor of a New
York Stock Exchange?

408
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:06,770
Maybe not.

409
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:08,950
I'll be willing to
make that prediction.

410
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:13,500
But big reliance
on connectivity.

411
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,340
Big tech, significant
online growth.

412
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,130
And you have different
parts of big tech.

413
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,510
You have the ones
that are really

414
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:25,300
focused on data and analytics,
like Google and Baidu.

415
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:30,570
They're being called
more into the fray

416
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:34,670
to use that data to help protect
the public through something

417
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:37,200
called contact
tracing and the like.

418
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,360
You have the online market
shops like Alibaba and Amazon,

419
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,380
huge growth, of course.

420
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:49,540
So significant online growth.

421
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:52,740
And then we go to
the fintech startups.

422
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,840
And I'd say the real
focus on the fintech

423
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,130
startups is this number one
point, what's your runway?

424
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:00,240
A term that we haven't
talked about in this class,

425
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,530
but runway is what's
your burn rate?

426
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:06,570
See, early startups-- not
just in financial technology--

427
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:08,790
early startups usually
are spending more

428
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,230
than their revenues.

429
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:13,500
And they're trying to
work to that sweet spot

430
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,420
when they can get to a place
and be really successful, where,

431
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,450
of course, revenues
are more than costs,

432
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:21,730
but also they've
built a platform.

433
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:25,590
They've built and start to
commercialize the network

434
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,820
economics.

435
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:30,170
And by network economics
or platform economics,

436
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:33,170
it's bringing two
sides of a marketplace

437
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:37,320
together and building a
platform in between it.

438
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,950
But there's a big focus on
revenue models and adoption.

439
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:43,290
And if you've
recently raised money,

440
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:46,240
you're in better shape
then if you haven't.

441
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,950
So it's not about whether you're
at the seed round or a series C

442
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:55,930
or D, meaning you've done three
or four rounds of funding.

443
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:58,490
It's really, how much
cash do you have?

444
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:00,490
What's your burn rate?

445
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:02,400
And hunkering down.

446
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,840
IPOs, Initial Public
Offerings, probably

447
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:10,040
off the table for the rest of
2020, and maybe well into '21.

448
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,940
Venture capitalists will talk,
as you saw in these readings,

449
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,070
that they are
investing, but they're

450
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:18,140
going to be slow and cautious.

451
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:23,390
And valuations, just like
the public market's down.

452
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:26,170
But if you don't
have an IPO takeout,

453
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:28,910
if you can't exit in
the public markets,

454
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:31,730
if you can't readily
convince your venture

455
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:34,430
capitalists about
your revenue models,

456
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:38,060
your valuations are coming off.

457
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,390
I think consolidation increases.

458
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:44,230
I think that the sectors
matter, and there's going

459
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,920
to be winners versus losers.

460
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:51,100
I think anybody that's deeply
reliant on transaction fees,

461
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,230
particularly in the
payment space, that's

462
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:55,430
a challenge right now.

463
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:58,540
Some businesses, the
sector matters even more,

464
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:02,530
like if you were Toast
servicing the restaurant field,

465
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:05,480
I have not talked to them
since this crisis started,

466
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,110
but I think that's
a challenging thing.

467
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:10,030
You could be a
transaction-based business

468
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:13,060
and have been in
great shape in January

469
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:16,550
and really pretty
lousy shape right now.

470
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:20,210
So some areas like retail,
travel, events, obviously.

471
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:24,730
Mobile trading-- mobile trading,
on the other hand, might be up,

472
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:28,550
the Robinhood numbers
and others like them.

473
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,260
Wealth management
like Betterment

474
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,910
that we talked about, maybe.

475
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:35,030
But if you're like
Root Insurance,

476
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:39,560
if you're an auto insurance
tech and people aren't driving,

477
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,940
it might be the other way.

478
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,830
So sector matters a lot.

479
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:46,740
Compliance up.

480
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:51,120
International cross-border
remittances, I believe likely

481
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,470
has some possibility.

482
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:57,570
But I still think runway matters
and consolidation increases.

483
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:59,250
And so a couple other thoughts.

484
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:01,590
Additional opportunities.

485
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:03,480
I think there's
additional opportunities

486
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,870
if you're serving those tapping
into the fiscal stimulus

487
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:08,470
and loan programs.

488
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:10,080
So what you've seen
around the globe,

489
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,730
whether it was PayPal,
SoFi, others saying,

490
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,950
we will help a small business.

491
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:20,550
Revolut in Europe, we will
help a small business fill out

492
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:23,640
their forms, apply
for the programs

493
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,360
here in the US,
programs in Europe.

494
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,250
And that's an opportunity
to actually build

495
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,230
customer relations.

496
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:34,750
Numerous amongst the fintech
startups here in the US

497
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,960
have raised their hand and
said to the Small Business

498
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,840
Administration, can
we be basically part

499
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,330
of the PPP program?

500
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:44,490
I don't mean receive
a forgivable loan.

501
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:48,610
I mean help issue
forgivable loans.

502
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:50,910
Romain I want to pause because
I see there is activity

503
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:53,520
in the chat room and
just see if there's--

504
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,110
TEACHING ASSISTANT: So we have
a general question from Rosanna

505
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:58,810
on whether there is a chance
that this crisis will impact

506
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:02,280
the stability of the US dollar.

507
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,020
GARY GENSLER: I
think, great question.

508
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:08,700
When you say stability,
I think of volatility.

509
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:12,900
But Rosanna, do you mean that,
or do you mean its centrality

510
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,120
in the world trading system?

511
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,090
AUDIENCE: I think centrality
in the world trade system.

512
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:18,800
GARY GENSLER: OK.

513
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:23,480
So I think that crises
like this usually--

514
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,090
and history shows
this time and again--

515
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:27,720
it's flight to quality.

516
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:33,160
And so right now, the US
dollar is that quality asset.

517
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:37,280
Our economy has got
huge challenges.

518
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,220
But I'm saying as
a fiat currency

519
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,440
compared to other
fiat currencies,

520
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,940
I think you've still
seen the flight

521
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,670
to quality in the US dollar.

522
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:54,610
I do think that if you go out
multiple decades, our handling,

523
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:57,430
as a public policy matter,
people will be looking,

524
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:59,080
how did our government respond?

525
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:03,200
How did we respond to
the health care crisis?

526
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,550
And I don't mean in the middle--

527
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,550
right now, there's going
to be all those debates

528
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,980
and they'll influence all sorts
of things like the November

529
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:09,480
election.

530
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,830
I'm talking about longer term.

531
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:14,530
Longer term, how
did we as a society,

532
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:18,530
how did we as a government
handle this crisis?

533
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,530
And I think this story
is not written yet,

534
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:24,370
even though right now
there's a lot of reasons

535
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,920
to think we didn't handle things
well in January and February

536
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,510
and March.

537
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:31,270
But we don't know about
the reopening yet.

538
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:36,370
But the US dollar, which
is probably over half--

539
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:37,930
depending upon
what statistic you

540
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:41,590
want to pick, between
half and 2/3 of trade,

541
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:45,700
the foreign currency markets,
the central bank reserves

542
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,940
around the globe are
on the US dollar.

543
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,400
I think you raise
a great question.

544
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,970
Will it change the US
dollar as the world's sort

545
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:58,150
of leading currency?

546
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,370
My guess is, probably not.

547
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:02,920
I think we're still
multiple decades away.

548
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,470
I think if China wants
to take that role

549
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:09,980
at some point in time, probably
late in the 21st century

550
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:12,910
sometime, they have to
really adjust themselves

551
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:15,920
to having a more
open capital market.

552
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:21,550
The US took the role
from the British

553
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:25,010
just about the same time
as the last big pandemic,

554
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:27,800
the one a hundred years
ago, the Spanish flu.

555
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:32,230
It's a coincidence, maybe,
so you're right to raise it.

556
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:35,060
But I don't think China
is in the position.

557
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:37,310
They don't have free and
open capital markets.

558
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:39,280
The US had free and
open capital markets.

559
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:43,190
They don't, frankly, have the
same legal systems that we had.

560
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:48,400
And so the UK was in relative
decline to the US already.

561
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,330
I don't think it was the Spanish
flu that gave us the chance

562
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:52,180
to take over.

563
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:56,010
World War I did give us
a chance to take over.

564
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:59,470
And so you're right, some future
crisis might be that moment,

565
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:01,430
but I don't think
this is that moment.

566
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:02,710
That's a good question.

567
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:03,550
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

568
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:05,110
What about the
volatility, though?

569
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:07,300
Do you think also that's--

570
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:10,480
GARY GENSLER: I've got
three minutes to finish up,

571
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,100
so can we do this offline?

572
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:16,060
But there's also
additional challenges

573
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,620
on delinquencies and defaults.

574
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,360
I think for fintech
companies, they

575
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,330
have to be very
aware, especially

576
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:26,500
if you're in consumer or
small business lending,

577
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,130
that delinquencies and
defaults will go up.

578
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:32,470
I just think-- and if
you have a business

579
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:36,020
model related to float because
interest rates went down.

580
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,050
So this is where
I'm going to close

581
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:42,170
is this chart from the Boston
Consulting Group breaks

582
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:43,750
subsectors.

583
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:46,890
And again, in this
class, I constantly

584
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:49,960
am focused on granularity.

585
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,540
You can be strategic, but
you have to be tactical.

586
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:55,690
You've got to get
down to each sector.

587
00:30:55,690 --> 00:31:01,220
In payments, trade finance
is probably at high risk.

588
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:04,160
But other areas might be OK.

589
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,830
Account to account,
person to a person

590
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:11,270
like Venmo, Paypal's Venmo,
might be in a good place.

591
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:15,330
In lending, unsecured
personal lending,

592
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:17,700
Boston Consulting
Group says a problem.

593
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,550
But their other parts, like
lending on infrastructure,

594
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,810
might be OK.

595
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:23,430
So you've got to get granular.

596
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:27,240
You've got to think about
each sector individually.

597
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,330
Insurance, I also
think it will be

598
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:33,030
interesting to see what happens
to some of the auto insurers

599
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:35,230
that BCG hasn't
put on this chart.

600
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:37,230
Everybody's going to have
their different chart.

601
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:40,080
This is not to say this
is the accurate chart.

602
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,120
I raised this Boston
Consulting Group

603
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:47,160
chart because I want to always
remind, it's granularity.

604
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,810
You need both
strategy and tactics

605
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:55,280
and to get into where the
cracks are in the system.
