ALIA MARTIN: I'm going
to be talking today

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,215
about how infants and
kids start to develop

10
00:00:25,215 --> 00:00:26,610
an understanding
of communication

11
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,776
and why this is an important
topic for understanding

12
00:00:28,776 --> 00:00:31,210
human intelligence.

13
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:32,980
So what is communication?

14
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,790
So really, basically,
communication

15
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,354
is a transfer or
exchange of information.

16
00:00:38,354 --> 00:00:40,020
And importantly, in
human communication,

17
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,754
this isn't just any
kind of information,

18
00:00:41,754 --> 00:00:43,920
but it's specifically the
kind of information that's

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,114
in our heads and in our minds.

20
00:00:46,114 --> 00:00:48,030
So for example, there's
information in my head

21
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,113
right now that I'm going
to be transferring to you

22
00:00:50,113 --> 00:00:51,420
over the course of this talk.

23
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,460
And the reason we need
communication to do this

24
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,710
and that we use it all
the time is obviously

25
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,760
that everyone has
minds of their own

26
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,630
and that we don't have access
to the mental states of others.

27
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,120
And we can't automatically
transfer our own mental states

28
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,840
to theirs without some means
of making those mental states

29
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,110
observable in the form of
communicating with them.

30
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,719
So people are both
cognitive beings--

31
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:16,260
we have to sort of navigate the
thoughts in our heads and try

32
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,240
to figure out the thoughts
that are in other's heads--

33
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,448
but we're also social beings.

34
00:01:19,448 --> 00:01:21,150
We really benefit
from gaining access

35
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,470
to the thoughts in
the minds of others

36
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,261
and giving them access
to our own thoughts.

37
00:01:24,261 --> 00:01:27,450
So for example, for cooperation,
competition, learning,

38
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,700
and teaching, and all the
kinds of social interactions

39
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,200
we do with each
other, we have to be

40
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,570
able to share the contents
of our mental states.

41
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,420
And it's this sort of joint,
both cognitive and social

42
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,920
nature of communication
that I think

43
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,878
makes it especially
important for understanding

44
00:01:39,878 --> 00:01:41,550
the development of
human intelligence.

45
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,010
It sort of crosscuts a lot
of these core knowledge

46
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:47,010
domains that Liz talked
about in her talk.

47
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,834
So human communication
requires reasoning

48
00:01:48,834 --> 00:01:50,250
about others'
cognitive states, so

49
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,249
understanding what others'
beliefs, and desires,

50
00:01:52,249 --> 00:01:53,520
and intentions are.

51
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,320
It also requires reasoning
about social interaction,

52
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,752
so understanding that typically
these kinds of thoughts,

53
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:00,210
and beliefs, and
intentions are not

54
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,620
shared among different people.

55
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,630
Everyone has their own
that are unobservable

56
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,880
and housed in their own heads.

57
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,770
But in the context
of a particular kind

58
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,830
of social interaction,
these people

59
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,440
can intentionally share their
thoughts with each other.

60
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,199
And communication often
involves reasoning

61
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:17,490
about a third thing, which
is language or communicative

62
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,800
signals outside of
language as well.

63
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,970
And so I'm going to back
to this point at the end,

64
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,470
but all these types
of reasoning are

65
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,540
going to come up in the studies
about infant communication

66
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,580
that I describe in the talk.

67
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,831
And so Liz talked about
how infants start out

68
00:02:34,831 --> 00:02:37,330
with these coherent, separate,
principle, and core knowledge

69
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,910
systems that contain some
limited representations

70
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,520
for reasoning about the world,
and which kind of come together

71
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,219
around the end of
the first year.

72
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:46,510
So if we want to figure out
how to build a model of how

73
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,030
social cognitive
development works,

74
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:52,090
we're going to need to
understand how an infant starts

75
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,610
to figure out, using
the core knowledge

76
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:58,000
that they have early in life,
the components of communication

77
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,940
and also how these components
come together so that infants

78
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,790
can build a more complex
causal model of communication

79
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:04,600
like adults have.

80
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,830
So this is just to
illustrate the points

81
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,094
I'm making about the
communicative situation.

82
00:03:13,094 --> 00:03:14,760
So in any given
communicative situation,

83
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,714
we can't just think about
the words that are being said

84
00:03:17,714 --> 00:03:18,630
or what we're hearing.

85
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,088
We need to think about it in
this broader context of having

86
00:03:21,088 --> 00:03:24,120
a communicator or maybe multiple
communicators, an addressee

87
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,730
or an audience, and also the
things that the communicator is

88
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,177
saying in the
broader context that

89
00:03:28,177 --> 00:03:29,760
allow us to figure
out what's going on

90
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,960
in this social interaction.

91
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,540
So it really requires
understanding

92
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,250
that the communicator's
mental states are

93
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,320
being transferred
in this causal way

94
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,809
to the mind of the addressee.

95
00:03:40,809 --> 00:03:42,600
So I'm going to structure
the talk in terms

96
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,516
of some important insights
from the philosophy

97
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,350
of human language
and communication

98
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,830
that I think have
really guided the way

99
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,780
researchers in the
last, say, 50 years have

100
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,430
been thinking about
the development

101
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,045
of human communication as well.

102
00:03:56,045 --> 00:03:58,170
So I'm going to broadly
illustrate the three points

103
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,461
that I'm taking from each,
and then I'll expand on them

104
00:04:00,461 --> 00:04:03,035
in each section.

105
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:04,410
So the first
insight that I think

106
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,951
is really important
for understanding

107
00:04:05,951 --> 00:04:10,629
how we think about communication
comes from John Austin, who

108
00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:11,920
brought up the important point.

109
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,586
So before Austin,
people tended to think

110
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,079
about language or study language
a lot in terms of language

111
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,440
itself, and the semantics, and
syntax, and just the language

112
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,240
signal.

113
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,250
But Austin pointed out
that language is actually

114
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,670
not just about the content,
but it's also an action.

115
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:30,750
It's actually something that we
use, and we do things with it,

116
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,060
in the same way that we do
things and accomplish things

117
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,969
in the world using other kinds
of actions that we engage in.

118
00:04:37,969 --> 00:04:40,260
So Austin sort of brought up
this important distinction

119
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,770
that language is not
just about the content.

120
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,150
So to illustrate
with an example,

121
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,094
in this communicative
interaction,

122
00:04:47,094 --> 00:04:48,010
there's language here.

123
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:50,160
This person is saying,
is there any salt?

124
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,780
And Austin analyzed
this in terms

125
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,180
of not only what
the words meant,

126
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,090
but in terms of three
layers of intentionality.

127
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:59,940
So in this simple
interaction, he pointed out

128
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,057
that there's a locutionary act,
or the meaning of the sentence,

129
00:05:03,057 --> 00:05:04,890
which is that there's
a question being asked

130
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,290
about the presence of
salt. But that there's

131
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,920
actually something
else going on here

132
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,210
as well, which is that there's
an illocutionary action, which

133
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,910
is what he considers to be
the intention underlying

134
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,920
the action, which is
to request the salt.

135
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,830
So if you actually just
read this sentence,

136
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,270
it's kind of under-determined.

137
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,000
It's not necessarily
obvious that this person's

138
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,759
asking the other person at
this table to pass the salt.

139
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,300
But if you take it
within the broader

140
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,216
context of the interaction,
you can understand

141
00:05:32,216 --> 00:05:34,920
that what's really going on here
is not just a sentence being

142
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,800
produced, but rather one
individual requesting something

143
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,800
from another, who is then
supposed to understand

144
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,380
the request, and in the
third layer of analysis,

145
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,990
cause the addressee
to provide the salt.

146
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,246
So the idea is that there are
these multiple things going on

147
00:05:52,246 --> 00:05:54,120
in the context of a
communicative interaction

148
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,079
involving language that
go beyond the words that

149
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,370
are actually being spoken here.

150
00:06:02,105 --> 00:06:06,310
And so if you're an infant, just
like in philosophy of language,

151
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,890
the focus in infant
cognitive development--

152
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,660
also for a long
time, and still is,

153
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,060
we still need to
understand these things--

154
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,610
was on understanding
how infants learn words,

155
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,889
or how infants figure out
the meaning of language,

156
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:19,930
and how it relates to
objects in the environment,

157
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,640
and later, to the
abstract concepts

158
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,410
that language indicates.

159
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,990
But importantly, understanding
communication for an infant

160
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,989
is going to be more than
about just figuring out

161
00:06:27,989 --> 00:06:29,140
the meaning of these words.

162
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,769
And so following the
philosophical tradition

163
00:06:31,769 --> 00:06:33,310
of people like
Austin, who introduced

164
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,452
the study of
pragmatics to language,

165
00:06:35,452 --> 00:06:36,910
developmental
psychologists as well

166
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,730
started thinking about the
importance of recognizing

167
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:42,820
communication as this
broader action in its context

168
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:46,150
for understanding how
infants come to be good

169
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,812
communicators themselves.

170
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:54,110
So if communication involves
this whole context of action

171
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,135
and interaction between
people, if you're

172
00:06:56,135 --> 00:06:58,010
a baby who's in the
business of understanding

173
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,010
the social world, the
agent world, and the world

174
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:02,480
of language, you're going to
be well-served by developing

175
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,000
an ability to identify these
kinds of communicative actions

176
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,800
or situations and
their components,

177
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,690
and to begin to
understand how they work.

178
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,050
So how do infants
start to figure out

179
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,840
when communication is going
on in the world around them,

180
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,150
rather than just identifying
words and associating them

181
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,777
with objects?

182
00:07:18,777 --> 00:07:20,360
So actually, there's
a lot of evidence

183
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,080
that infants are
identifying key features

184
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,540
of communicative situations
really early in life.

185
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,140
So from the time they're
born, newborn human infants

186
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:33,350
prefer listening to
speech over other sounds.

187
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,060
So the typical
method that's used

188
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,980
to measure the preference
of an infant who's

189
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,080
only one to four
days old is to have

190
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,020
them suck on a pacifier
that's connected

191
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,380
to a machine that detects how
strongly infants are sucking.

192
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,230
And then the sucking is
used as a measure of infants

193
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,180
arousal upon hearing
a particular sound

194
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,370
or being exposed to a
particular stimulus.

195
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:56,210
And so what researchers found
is that if you have infants suck

196
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,100
on this pacifier while
listening to speech

197
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,110
sounds and nonspeech
sounds in alternation,

198
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,860
nonspeech sounds being
sine wave-produced sounds

199
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,962
that are very similar to
speech in their features.

200
00:08:05,962 --> 00:08:08,420
If you listen to it, it has
the prosodic contours of speech

201
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,600
and sounds a lot like it,
but it's not actually speech.

202
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,770
You can't actually
parse any words from it.

203
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,140
Infants showed a
preference for listening

204
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,900
to speech over nonspeech,
or more arousal

205
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,108
when they listened to speech.

206
00:08:21,108 --> 00:08:24,234
So they maintained
their arousal for speech

207
00:08:24,234 --> 00:08:25,650
over the course
of the experiment,

208
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,710
but for nonspeech, it declined.

209
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,600
And so extremely
early in life, infants

210
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,910
seem to have this bias
for paying attention

211
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:34,820
to the primary communicative
signal of our species, that is,

212
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,559
human speech.

213
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,027
Quite early in life
as well, infants

214
00:08:43,027 --> 00:08:45,610
recognize some of the important
features of the social context

215
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,260
surrounding speech,
so getting more

216
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,300
into the domain of the important
features for communication.

217
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,471
So by six months,
infants seem to recognize

218
00:08:52,471 --> 00:08:54,220
that speech is
human-produced, or at least

219
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,020
associate speech
with other humans,

220
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:59,110
and also human-directed.

221
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:02,290
So in one study, infants
saw pictures of human faces

222
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:06,474
or faces of monkeys, and
they heard different sounds.

223
00:09:06,474 --> 00:09:07,390
So they either heard--

224
00:09:11,374 --> 00:09:14,830
oh, it seems like the sound
is not on, but that's OK.

225
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:17,332
So they either-- oops.

226
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,820
So they either heard a
speech sound in a language

227
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,980
they never heard before
repeating itself,

228
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,470
or they heard a monkey call.

229
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:30,335
And infants in one trial either
saw-- so in the first trial,

230
00:09:30,335 --> 00:09:32,210
say, they'd see the
human face, and then they

231
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:36,080
could listen repeatedly
to a speech sound

232
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,977
until they looked
away for two seconds.

233
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,560
And then they would
see a monkey face,

234
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,390
and then they would hear either
a speech sound or a monkey

235
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,010
sound and be able to
look at this image

236
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,780
while listening to that
sound until they looked away

237
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,800
for two seconds.

238
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,690
And so they got all
possible combinations.

239
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:50,060
Sometimes they saw a human
face and listened to speech.

240
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,893
Sometimes they saw a
human face and listened

241
00:09:51,893 --> 00:09:52,790
to the monkey sounds.

242
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,373
And sometimes they
saw the monkey face

243
00:09:54,373 --> 00:09:57,666
and listened to either human
speech or the monkey sound.

244
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,540
And the question was
whether infants actually

245
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,507
could match speech
sounds to humans

246
00:10:02,507 --> 00:10:05,090
and recognize that they should
be produced by the human rather

247
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,665
than the monkey.

248
00:10:06,665 --> 00:10:07,790
And that's what they found.

249
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:11,270
So you can see that when
infants heard speech,

250
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,790
they were much more
likely to look at the--

251
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,654
yeah, they were looking at the
human when they heard speech,

252
00:10:16,654 --> 00:10:18,320
and then they were
looking at the monkey

253
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,695
when they heard
the monkey calls.

254
00:10:22,116 --> 00:10:24,240
Similarly, infants seem to
understand by six months

255
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,370
that speech is directed
at other humans.

256
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:29,370
So when they saw
a person talking

257
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:32,130
behind a barrier
versus acting, so

258
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,080
swiping with her hand
behind a barrier,

259
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,460
and then the
barrier was revealed

260
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:39,060
to reveal either a
person or an object,

261
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,975
infants looked longer for
the speaking familiarization

262
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,350
when they saw that
there had been

263
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,270
an object behind the
barrier than a person,

264
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,860
suggesting that
they expected speech

265
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,487
to be directed toward
another person.

266
00:10:49,487 --> 00:10:51,570
And in contrast, when they
saw the person swiping,

267
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,190
they looked much longer
when they saw a person

268
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,856
behind the barrier
because typically, we

269
00:10:54,856 --> 00:10:55,860
don't swipe at people.

270
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,960
We tend to speak to them.

271
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,910
So this suggests that
infants understand

272
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:10,490
some of the features
of the context

273
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:13,950
in which human
communication is produced.

274
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:16,095
Importantly, infants
do still seem

275
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,470
to be developing this ability
over the first year of life

276
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,511
because it's not until 10
months that they expect

277
00:11:20,511 --> 00:11:22,250
mutual gaze between
speakers, which

278
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,410
tends to be an important
part of understanding

279
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:27,750
the social context
of communication.

280
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:31,165
So in this study, infants saw
two people facing each other.

281
00:11:31,165 --> 00:11:33,290
This is just one of the
experiments from the study.

282
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,600
But you can see that they
saw the two people looking

283
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,308
at each other and
speaking to each other,

284
00:11:37,308 --> 00:11:41,540
or the two people looking apart
and speaking to each other.

285
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,240
Infants at nine months
didn't differentiate

286
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,470
between these at all.

287
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:49,280
So at nine months,
they didn't necessarily

288
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,530
think that the people were
going to look at each other

289
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:52,760
when they were speaking.

290
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,340
But at 10 months,
you can see here

291
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,580
that infants looked longer
for the averted gaze

292
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,840
than for the mutual gaze.

293
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,390
So infants seem to
be able to recognize

294
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:10,250
when a communicative context
is going on early in life.

295
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,250
But we don't necessarily
know from these studies

296
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,000
whether they really understand
that communication is happening

297
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,442
or whether they're
just detecting

298
00:12:17,442 --> 00:12:19,650
some important features of
communicative interactions

299
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:22,290
that might help them to glom
onto communication so that they

300
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,324
can eventually develop
an ability to figure out

301
00:12:24,324 --> 00:12:26,490
what's going on within the
communicative interaction

302
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,604
themselves.

303
00:12:27,604 --> 00:12:29,520
So, so far in the studies
that I've mentioned,

304
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,570
there's nothing cognitive here.

305
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,770
There's nothing
really about infants

306
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,870
having to understand the
intentions or the mental states

307
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,036
of the speaker going into
the mind of the addressee,

308
00:12:36,036 --> 00:12:38,170
like I was talking about before.

309
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,195
So a question I've
explored in my research

310
00:12:40,195 --> 00:12:42,570
is whether infants recognize
that when these features are

311
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,490
in place, when you have a
communicative signal, which

312
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:45,872
is something they
recognize, when

313
00:12:45,872 --> 00:12:47,580
you have a communicator
and addressee who

314
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,430
are socially engaged
with each other,

315
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:52,050
do infants recognize that
communication can actually lead

316
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,954
to the transfer of information?

317
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,857
So do infants understand
that speech, using speech,

318
00:12:59,857 --> 00:13:02,190
because this is something
that infants seem to recognize

319
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,590
as a signal that's important
in communicative context,

320
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,107
can transfer information
between individuals?

321
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:14,160
So we can use speech to
communicate with each other

322
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,210
about what we're interested in.

323
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,180
So if I'm observing
this interaction

324
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,040
between a communicator
and an addressee,

325
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,686
I can infer that if the
communicator says, the cup,

326
00:13:22,686 --> 00:13:24,060
and there's only
one cup present,

327
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,560
the addressee's
probably going to be

328
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,470
able to figure out what it is
that the communicator wants.

329
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:31,392
And I can figure this out even
from a third party perspective.

330
00:13:31,392 --> 00:13:33,600
And I can also understand
that other kinds of sounds,

331
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,760
like perhaps a positive
emotional vocalization,

332
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,430
are not going to be as
effective in communicating

333
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:42,060
to the addressee what the
communicator is interested in.

334
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,130
So speech and also
other communicative

335
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:46,590
signals as well that can specify
this sort of information,

336
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:49,410
perhaps like pointing or
particular kinds of gestures,

337
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:53,340
can transfer information from
one individual to another.

338
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:56,010
So speech is going to be more
effective for communicating

339
00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:00,210
than other kinds of
noncommunicative actions.

340
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,700
And importantly, for the
purposes of this study,

341
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,520
you're not just going to know
that communicative information

342
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,990
transfer is going on because you
know what the word cup means,

343
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:13,150
even in a situation
where you're listening

344
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,150
to a foreign language,
and you have no idea what

345
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,501
the meaning of the words are.

346
00:14:16,501 --> 00:14:18,000
Even in this
situation, you're going

347
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,375
to understand that some kind
of communicative information

348
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,577
transfer can happen.

349
00:14:21,577 --> 00:14:24,160
So we've all had the experience
of being in a foreign country,

350
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,410
presumably, where
you're listening

351
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:26,650
to people speak to each other.

352
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:28,858
You can't necessarily
understand what they're saying,

353
00:14:28,858 --> 00:14:31,090
but you know that information
transfer is happening.

354
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:33,256
So the interesting thing
about communicative actions

355
00:14:33,256 --> 00:14:35,040
like speech is that
when we witness them,

356
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,831
we can know that people
are communicatively

357
00:14:36,831 --> 00:14:38,490
sharing information,
even when we

358
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:42,480
don't know what information is
being communicated ourselves.

359
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,450
And this insight
suggests that maybe,

360
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,790
if you're an infant,
one really good way

361
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:50,430
to jump into the communicative
interactions around you

362
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:55,440
and start to understand
what's going on

363
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,810
is to be able to identify
when others are communicating.

364
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,630
And hearing the sounds
of speech exchanged

365
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:02,490
between two people in the
context of a social interaction

366
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:05,380
might be a really
good way to do this.

367
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,800
So an ability to figure out
when communication's going on

368
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,740
like this might provide infants
with this really powerful way

369
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,080
of being able to track the
information flow between two

370
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,720
other people's minds
and also to figure out,

371
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,760
based on their responses
to each other, what

372
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,870
the actual content of
the words might mean.

373
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:24,210
So we asked whether
infants recognize

374
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:28,447
that speech is communicative
at 12 months of age.

375
00:15:28,447 --> 00:15:30,030
And so in the procedure
of this study,

376
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:32,280
infants were privy
to a third party

377
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,950
interaction between a
communicator and an addressee.

378
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:38,440
And the infant is always just
observing the interaction.

379
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,120
This is so that we can
isolate whether infants think

380
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,620
that certain communicative
vocalizations can transfer

381
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,230
information from the
communicator to an addressee,

382
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:49,179
even when the infant themselves
has all the information.

383
00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:50,970
So the third party
nature of this procedure

384
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:53,310
is important here for seeing
whether infants really

385
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:56,370
are thinking about the fact that
thoughts are typically isolated

386
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:59,040
in particular people's minds,
but with communication, they

387
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,700
can be shared.

388
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:04,500
So infants in these studies
were given a violation

389
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,860
of expectation paradigm.

390
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,340
In this kind of experiment,
as many of you probably know,

391
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:11,610
infants are shown a story
through a series of scenes.

392
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:14,910
And then in the last
scene or series of scenes,

393
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,800
they're shown different
kinds of endings.

394
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,800
And we're interested in whether
infants are surprised or look

395
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,610
longer at some endings more
than they do at others.

396
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:25,890
So infants in these studies
were shown a live display

397
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,152
where they had an actor in
front of them in a stage.

398
00:16:28,152 --> 00:16:30,360
First, they were familiarized
with this actor showing

399
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,730
a preference for an object
by picking it up and playing

400
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:36,090
with it repeatedly in
three separate scenes.

401
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:38,670
And so, as in the studies
by Amanda Woodward that Liz

402
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:42,400
already mentioned,
infants, by 12 months

403
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,010
and as early as three
months, will attribute a goal

404
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:48,811
to this person for reaching for
that particular target object.

405
00:16:48,811 --> 00:16:50,310
So after being
familiarized to this,

406
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,799
infants saw an addressee,
who was a new person,

407
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:54,840
present in a totally
different part of the stage.

408
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,464
They had never seen
this person before,

409
00:16:56,464 --> 00:16:59,010
and they'd never seen the
two people together before.

410
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:01,230
This person reached for
both objects in turn.

411
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,180
So first, she grabbed
this one, then this one,

412
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,640
and then this one, and
then this one again

413
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,181
to show that she didn't have a
preference between the objects

414
00:17:07,181 --> 00:17:10,069
and could reach both of them.

415
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:12,680
Then in the test scene,
so this is the ending

416
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,167
that we showed infants, they
saw the two people together

417
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,000
for the first time, but
now the communicator

418
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,730
couldn't reach the objects
because only her face had

419
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,020
access to the stage.

420
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,470
But the addressee could
still reach them just fine.

421
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:27,560
At this point, the
crucial manipulation

422
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,750
was the vocalization
uttered by the communicator.

423
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,390
So she either produced a speech
sound, the nonsense word koba,

424
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:38,300
which infants had not
heard before, she produced

425
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,520
a coughing sound, so
something that would typically

426
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,920
be physiological and not
intentional or communicative

427
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,867
in any way, or an emotional
vocalization, so a sound

428
00:17:45,867 --> 00:17:47,450
that perhaps could
convey information.

429
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:50,720
If I say, ooh, you might think
I'm interested in something,

430
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,814
I'm feeling positive,
but you won't necessarily

431
00:17:52,814 --> 00:17:53,480
know what it is.

432
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,570
So this one's sort of in
the middle of the other two.

433
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:00,025
And then, infants saw
the addressee either

434
00:18:00,025 --> 00:18:02,150
provide the target object
that the communicator had

435
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,720
reached for before or
the nontarget object.

436
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,640
And the question is, do
infants understand that speech

437
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,980
as a communicative signal,
do they have some expectation

438
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,438
that even though they've never
heard this particular speech

439
00:18:12,438 --> 00:18:15,230
sound used before, that speech
can transfer information such

440
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:18,320
that the addressee will
now be able to select

441
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,550
the correct object?

442
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:22,310
Whereas nonspeech vocalizations
like coughing and emotional

443
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,900
vocalizations can't.

444
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,970
So if so, infants in
the speech condition

445
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:30,020
should look longer to nontarget
than target actions, responses,

446
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,666
finding these unexpected.

447
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:33,290
And infants in the
other two conditions

448
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,956
shouldn't differentiate
between the two.

449
00:18:37,537 --> 00:18:38,620
And this is what we found.

450
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,150
So in the speech
condition, infants

451
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,139
are looking longer to
nontarget than target,

452
00:18:42,139 --> 00:18:43,930
suggesting that they
understand that speech

453
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:46,747
can transfer information
about the communicator's goal.

454
00:18:46,747 --> 00:18:48,580
But when the communicator
coughs or produces

455
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,350
an emotional
vocalization, infants

456
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:54,280
don't show these
same expectations.

457
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,709
So this is some initial
evidence that by 12 months,

458
00:18:56,709 --> 00:18:59,250
infants not only recognize the
context in which communication

459
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,130
occurs and attend to
speech as a special signal

460
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:06,240
for communication, but
they also understand

461
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,360
that speech is something that's
able to transfer information

462
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,360
between two people.

463
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,190
So we also ran a few
control conditions

464
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:17,534
to rule out alternative
explanations for this.

465
00:19:17,534 --> 00:19:19,950
So one important question is,
are infants really reasoning

466
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:26,230
about the addressee's access to
information in this situation?

467
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:30,092
So for example, in
the case where the--

468
00:19:30,092 --> 00:19:32,550
if infants are really reasoning
with the addressee's access

469
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:35,460
to information, then in a case
where the communicator makes

470
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,322
a positive emotional
vocalization,

471
00:19:37,322 --> 00:19:39,780
and the addressee has previous
information about what she's

472
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,880
interested in, so for
example, if she just

473
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,820
saw that the communicator
was trying to feed her child

474
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,100
or wanted a drink of
water, she might know now

475
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,562
that a positive emotional
vocalization is indicating

476
00:19:49,562 --> 00:19:50,520
something like the cup.

477
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,514
So we set up a scenario
like this as well.

478
00:19:56,514 --> 00:19:58,930
In this case, it's exactly the
same as the previous study,

479
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:01,150
except that the addressee
had visual access

480
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:04,351
to the communicators preference
during the familiarization

481
00:20:04,351 --> 00:20:04,850
phase.

482
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:07,540
So now she knows what it is
that the communicator likes.

483
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,000
And this is important for making
sure the infants recognize

484
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,770
that something
like visual access

485
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,630
can provide the addressee
with information

486
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:17,300
about the
communicator's interest.

487
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,072
So now infants saw the same
addressee familiarization.

488
00:20:20,072 --> 00:20:22,030
And then in the test,
they saw the communicator

489
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:25,570
produce the vocalization
ooh once again.

490
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:28,930
So now even though
ooh was not treated

491
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:31,319
as a communicative vocalization
in the previous studies,

492
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:33,610
if infants are reasoning
about the kinds of information

493
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,290
that the addressee
has access to,

494
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,702
they should now expect that
the addressee will provide

495
00:20:37,702 --> 00:20:39,160
the target object
because she knows

496
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,709
from a previous scene what the
communicator was interested in.

497
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:45,250
So this is important also for
ruling out the possibility that

498
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,770
maybe just hearing these
noncommunicative vocalizations

499
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:49,900
surprises or confuses
infants or makes

500
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,360
them unable to reason
about the scenario anymore.

501
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,670
Here, they're getting a
noncommunicative vocalization,

502
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:58,180
but the addressee has
access to information.

503
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,160
And here, as in the
speech condition,

504
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,650
infants looked longer at
the nontarget outcome.

505
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:06,550
So this is just some evidence
that infants are really

506
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,920
thinking about the idea
that relevant sources

507
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,530
of information, such as a
communicative vocalization,

508
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,450
but also prior
visual access, can

509
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:18,070
give the addressee information
about the communicator's goal.

510
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,519
So they are reasoning
about information access.

511
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:22,810
Another important question
is, are they really thinking

512
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:24,310
about the source of
information, or do they

513
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,710
have-- so what's really the
mechanism behind what infants

514
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:27,335
are doing here?

515
00:21:27,335 --> 00:21:29,980
Are they thinking something
like, when I hear speech,

516
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,869
everything will go
well, or the speaker

517
00:21:31,869 --> 00:21:33,160
is going to get what she wants?

518
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,876
Or are they really thinking
about communication

519
00:21:35,876 --> 00:21:37,750
in this causal way,
where the information has

520
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,150
to come from the
speaker and be delivered

521
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:43,430
to the listener in
order for it to work?

522
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:46,000
So to test for this, infants
saw another communicator

523
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,807
familiarization.

524
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:49,390
Here, the communicator is alone,
so they've never seen the two

525
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,130
people together before.

526
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,750
She reaches for
the target object.

527
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,390
Then they see the
addressee again.

528
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,700
And then in the test
scene, in this case,

529
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,130
the addressee is the one
who produces the speech.

530
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:03,320
So speech is present in
the scene as it was before,

531
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,100
but it's not being produced by
the communicator or the person

532
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,470
who showed a preference.

533
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,970
So if infants just
think that speech

534
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:12,850
leads to people obtaining
their goals or magical outcomes

535
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:15,280
happening, then they
should expect the addressee

536
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,960
to provide the
target here as well.

537
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,540
But if they understand that
they don't know anything

538
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,610
about the addressee, in
which case, this is not

539
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,500
really informative
about either object,

540
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,710
then they should look
equally to both outcomes.

541
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:29,740
And in fact, this is what
they do at 12 months.

542
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:32,200
So infants here don't
expect information

543
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,700
to be transferred
from one person

544
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,370
to another, unless the first
person who communicated

545
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:39,220
is the one who actually had
the information to provide.

546
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,267
So by 12 months, infants
seem to recognize

547
00:22:46,267 --> 00:22:47,850
that speech is
communicative, and they

548
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,850
seem to have some of the
parts of a causal model

549
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:50,620
of communication.

550
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,203
They're not just
thinking about speech

551
00:22:52,203 --> 00:22:55,600
as something that can
produce successful outcomes,

552
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,690
but as something
that can be used

553
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:00,120
to have information move from
the mind of one individual

554
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,920
to another.

555
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,510
So a 12-month-old
seemed to recognize

556
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,580
that speech is communicative.

557
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,260
But we really wanted
to get at the idea

558
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,300
that understanding that
speech is communicative

559
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,610
might be something
that drives and guides

560
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,560
word learning and language
acquisition, rather

561
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,018
than something that
is as a result.

562
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:17,250
So what a 12-month-old
could be doing in this study

563
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,740
is hearing the word koba,
associating it with the object

564
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,420
that the communicator
had reached for,

565
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,260
and then thinking, OK,
that one's the koba,

566
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:26,280
so that's what the
addressee should reach for.

567
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,040
But in these studies, we were
interested in whether infants

568
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,770
at an even younger age,
who would be very, very

569
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:34,037
unlikely to be associating
the word with the object

570
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:36,120
or learning a label for
the object over the course

571
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,800
of the study, would
also recognize

572
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,470
that speech can transfer
information about one person

573
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:41,890
to another person.

574
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:44,700
And so for this reason,
we tested 6-month-olds,

575
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,466
because 6-month-olds
understand only some very, very

576
00:23:47,466 --> 00:23:48,840
common words in
their environment

577
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,214
and will look to
the right object

578
00:23:50,214 --> 00:23:52,930
when they hear the label for it.

579
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,841
But these are very,
very limited words,

580
00:23:54,841 --> 00:23:56,340
and there's no
evidence for learning

581
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,020
a word in a single
trial, which is what they

582
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,200
would have to do in this study.

583
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,241
They would have to hear
koba, and then think back

584
00:24:01,241 --> 00:24:03,327
to what the communicator
had reached for,

585
00:24:03,327 --> 00:24:05,910
and really learn that word over
the course of the study, which

586
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:08,910
we have no evidence that
a 6-month-old can do.

587
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:10,590
So the goal of looking
at this age group

588
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,131
was to see whether
infants might have

589
00:24:12,131 --> 00:24:15,270
a more abstract understanding
of the idea that when speech

590
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:18,030
is produced, information can
be transferred from one person

591
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:21,240
to another, even
when they themselves

592
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,830
don't know what
that information--

593
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:29,250
or what the link between
the word and the object.

594
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:32,460
So a 6-month-old
saw the same scenes.

595
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,839
We gave them the speech
versus cough contrast.

596
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:36,880
And they look the same as
the 12-month-olds here.

597
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,250
So you can see that
in the speech case,

598
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,840
they're looking longer
for the nontarget outcome.

599
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,423
And in the cough
case, they're looking

600
00:24:41,423 --> 00:24:42,940
longer for the target outcome.

601
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,539
And so we haven't done all of
the same control conditions

602
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:46,830
as with the 12-month-olds here.

603
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:49,200
So I think there's a lot of
room for questions about how

604
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,300
a 6-month-old's understanding
of communication

605
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,610
in this causal way more
limited than the understanding

606
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:54,660
of 12-month-olds.

607
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,180
Would a six-month-old
think that if speech

608
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,610
was produced by a loudspeaker
or by the addressee,

609
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:01,960
that the communicator would
still get the right object?

610
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,160
So there are a lot of
open questions about--

611
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,520
these basic questions about
how infants' understanding

612
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,561
of communicative information
transfer starts out.

613
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,840
So these experiments
suggest that by six months,

614
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,260
infants seem to understand
that speech is communicative,

615
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,850
in addition to the other
studies that suggest

616
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,350
they understand
some of the features

617
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,847
of communicative interactions.

618
00:25:21,847 --> 00:25:23,680
They recognize that it
transfers information

619
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,109
from one person to another.

620
00:25:25,109 --> 00:25:26,650
And I'd like to
argue that this might

621
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,774
be something that provides
a mechanism for language

622
00:25:28,774 --> 00:25:32,099
and knowledge acquisition,
so sort of guides infants

623
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:33,640
to the kinds of
relevant interactions

624
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,390
where they might want to
learn things about people,

625
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:37,930
and their mental states, and
the words that they're using,

626
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:41,770
rather than first learning
those words through association

627
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:44,692
and then later coming to this
more abstract understanding.

628
00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:48,850
So the idea is that
infants might start out

629
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,590
with this understanding
of what communication is

630
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,330
and when it's happening,
and then can sort of fill

631
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:54,490
in the rest from there,
and that this might be one

632
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:57,530
of the earlier blocks of that.

633
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:59,730
So I'll try to go fairly
quickly through the rest.

634
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,480
So the second insight
I wanted to bring up

635
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,710
that I think is
especially important

636
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:05,043
is that communication requires
this focus on intentions.

637
00:26:05,043 --> 00:26:06,700
And this was really
the work of Grice

638
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,750
that highlighted this, and
in particular, a special type

639
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,560
of communicative intention.

640
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,560
So going back to the
example from the beginning.

641
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,390
When someone asks,
is there any salt,

642
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:17,800
Austin proposed that
there are these three

643
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,660
levels on which we can think
about this communicative

644
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,440
action.

645
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,540
And Grice was the one who
really formalized this

646
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,640
by talking about this
special kind of intention

647
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,310
that we see in the
domain of communication,

648
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:29,590
human communication
in particular, which

649
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:32,080
is the idea of speaker meaning.

650
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,324
And so his idea is that there's
this double-layered intention

651
00:26:35,324 --> 00:26:37,490
that comes when we're
communicating with each other.

652
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:40,030
So we have a communicator
who intends the addressee

653
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,510
to respond in a particular way.

654
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,630
So here, the communicator
wants the addressee

655
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:47,290
to provide some salt.
The communicator

656
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:50,350
intends for the addressee to
recognize that the communicator

657
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,040
intends to have that response.

658
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:57,820
So this person not only wants
this person to pass the salt,

659
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,560
but wants her to
recognize that that

660
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,080
is what he's asking for, that
that is the request that he's

661
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:02,860
making.

662
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,520
And importantly,
this third point,

663
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:08,650
which is that the communicator
intends the addressee

664
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:11,920
to respond that way on the
basis of the recognition

665
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,120
of that intention.

666
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,220
And so to make this a
little more concrete,

667
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,279
in this case, if he
asks her for the salt,

668
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,570
and she passes it because
she heard him and understands

669
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:21,850
that's what he's asking
for, that's great.

670
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:24,160
But the argument is that
communication wouldn't really

671
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,900
be happening if,
for example, she

672
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,850
was wearing headphones
and listening to music,

673
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:29,350
and she hadn't really
been listening to him,

674
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:32,140
and she just happened to pick
up the salt and pass it to him.

675
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:35,027
So communication,
I mean, it would

676
00:27:35,027 --> 00:27:36,610
look like a communicative
interaction.

677
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,980
The right kind of outcome is
still happening in response

678
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,060
to what he said.

679
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:43,270
But if she has no access
to the actual message,

680
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:46,300
if she doesn't produce
the response by virtue

681
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:50,911
of understanding what the
communicator is trying to say,

682
00:27:50,911 --> 00:27:52,660
then communication
hasn't really occurred.

683
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,118
It's just sort of
a lucky accident.

684
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:01,709
So I'll skip this part.

685
00:28:01,709 --> 00:28:03,500
So this is this important
kind of intention

686
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,980
that we see in human
communication, in which I'll

687
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,563
later briefly mention,
we don't really

688
00:28:06,563 --> 00:28:10,520
see in animal communication
in the same sort of way.

689
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,701
So how do infants start to get
this idea about communication,

690
00:28:13,701 --> 00:28:15,200
that it's not just
about identifying

691
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,700
communicative
interactions, but also

692
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:20,270
about understanding these
particular kinds of intentions?

693
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:22,250
So in the '90s,
there was this shift

694
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:25,640
in developmental psychology
to looking at word learning,

695
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:30,440
not only in terms of infants'
associations of words

696
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,560
in the environment, but to also,
with the work of Dare Baldwin,

697
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,780
to thinking about other
people's intentions

698
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,190
when they're using words.

699
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:41,030
And so she had these really
elegant studies where--

700
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:43,280
with this funny image--

701
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,670
where she pointed out
that if infants really

702
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:48,830
were learning words
through association,

703
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:51,160
then it wouldn't be
very efficient for them

704
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,910
because they would
make a lot of mistakes.

705
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:54,680
So for example, in
this kind of situation,

706
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,340
here's a dad and his baby.

707
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,910
The baby is looking
at this lizard.

708
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:00,500
The dad is looking
at this rooster.

709
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,200
And the dad says,
what a cheeky rooster.

710
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,840
So if you as the infant
are only learning words

711
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,110
on the basis of associating
what you hear with what you see,

712
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:11,674
you're going to learn that
the word rooster refers

713
00:29:11,674 --> 00:29:13,340
to this thing rather
than to this thing.

714
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,660
And you're going
to get it wrong.

715
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,500
So Baldwin did a
whole host of studies

716
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:24,020
in the second year of life
where she set up situations

717
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,510
where infants were looking at
particular objects like here.

718
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:29,000
And then she had their parents
or an experimenter look

719
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,680
at a different object
and label that one

720
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,720
to see what infants would do.

721
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,380
And what she found is
that infants actually

722
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:39,440
would consult their
parent or consult

723
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,840
the other person for cues to
reference, to what they're

724
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,197
intending to label.

725
00:29:43,197 --> 00:29:44,780
So if, for example,
in this situation,

726
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:47,309
the infant, when hearing
this, instead of just assuming

727
00:29:47,309 --> 00:29:49,100
the word refers to what
they're looking at,

728
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,890
would actually look up to dad
to see what he's looking at

729
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,956
and then follow his line
of gaze to understand

730
00:29:53,956 --> 00:29:56,330
that this is the object that
he's actually talking about.

731
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:58,490
AUDIENCE: At this age?

732
00:29:58,490 --> 00:29:58,990
At this age?

733
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:00,281
ALIA MARTIN: Yeah, at this age.

734
00:30:00,281 --> 00:30:02,270
Yeah.

735
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:04,730
So the idea is that infants
in the second year of life,

736
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:07,880
at least, are understanding that
understanding what someone's

737
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,415
referring to involves consulting
cues to their attention

738
00:30:10,415 --> 00:30:13,700
and intentions rather than
just the infant's own.

739
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,091
And I think I'll skip this one.

740
00:30:19,091 --> 00:30:20,840
There are other studies
showing this, too.

741
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,790
So in this one,
there's an experimenter

742
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,420
who puts these two
objects in a box.

743
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:27,200
The objects switch
while she's absent.

744
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,230
And then she looks
in one box and says--

745
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:32,850
the boxes are closed, and she
says, there's a sefo in here.

746
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:35,350
So if the infant understands
that they have to pay attention

747
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:38,046
to what the person knows about
or what the person thinks

748
00:30:38,046 --> 00:30:39,920
rather than their own
knowledge to figure out

749
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,000
what she's labeling,
then now when she says,

750
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,060
can you get the sefo, the
infant should actually

751
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:46,670
pull the object out
of here, assuming

752
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:48,170
that this is the
one she's labeling,

753
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:51,890
because that's the one that
she was intending to label.

754
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:56,150
And in fact, that's what
infants do at 17 months.

755
00:30:56,150 --> 00:31:01,040
In the case where the
experimenter had a false belief

756
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,600
about the location
of the object,

757
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,302
infants tend to go to
the non-referred box

758
00:31:05,302 --> 00:31:07,010
more often because
they think that that's

759
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:08,176
the one that she's labeling.

760
00:31:08,176 --> 00:31:10,797
But in the case where she saw
the switch happen, so now she

761
00:31:10,797 --> 00:31:13,130
knows what's everywhere,
infants will just go to the box

762
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:15,710
that she's referring to figure
out the location of the object

763
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,574
that she's naming.

764
00:31:17,574 --> 00:31:19,490
So this is all in the
second year of life, not

765
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:21,485
those younger core
knowledge ages

766
00:31:21,485 --> 00:31:22,610
that Liz was talking about.

767
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:28,320
So this is evidence that
infants consult speaker cues

768
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,780
to intentions, but not of
this special kind of intention

769
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,484
that Grice was pointing out.

770
00:31:32,484 --> 00:31:34,650
So I'm just going to tell
you about a couple-- well,

771
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:37,149
one of my favorite studies, I
just think that this is really

772
00:31:37,149 --> 00:31:37,680
neat--

773
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:41,130
where Ellen Markman's
lab and then later

774
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:43,500
replicated by
Tomasello's lab, showed

775
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,870
that it seems like
children, by 30 months

776
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:49,830
and then gotten down to
18 months by Grosse et al,

777
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:54,450
actually do seem to care
about not only the effects

778
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:56,790
of communication, but
also that the effects

779
00:31:56,790 --> 00:32:00,870
are produced by virtue of
the message being understood.

780
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:02,580
So you're probably
wondering why there's

781
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,970
a dirty sock on the screen.

782
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:10,122
So in this study, children were
presented with two objects.

783
00:32:10,122 --> 00:32:11,580
So they saw, on a
table, there were

784
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,621
two objects that were out
of their reach, a truck

785
00:32:13,621 --> 00:32:15,210
and a dirty sock.

786
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:18,259
And the idea was to elicit
children to request an object.

787
00:32:18,259 --> 00:32:19,800
Now obviously, the
children are going

788
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,174
to request this object, which
is what the researchers had

789
00:32:22,174 --> 00:32:23,490
intended in this case.

790
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:25,549
So children tended to
point at this object.

791
00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:27,840
So they had children producing
their own communication,

792
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,334
and then the
experimenter responded

793
00:32:29,334 --> 00:32:30,750
to the communication
of the infant

794
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,430
in one of four different ways.

795
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,847
So she either said, you
asked for the truck?

796
00:32:34,847 --> 00:32:36,180
I'm going to give you the truck.

797
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:38,220
So she expressed
understanding of the request,

798
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:41,124
and she provided the
requested object.

799
00:32:41,124 --> 00:32:43,290
In a second case, she said,
you asked for the truck?

800
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:44,581
I'm going to give you the sock.

801
00:32:44,581 --> 00:32:46,290
So here, she expressed
understanding,

802
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:48,810
but refused to commit
to the request,

803
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:51,590
to give the thing the
child had asked for.

804
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,490
In a third case, the
experimenter said,

805
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:54,840
you asked for the sock?

806
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,770
I'm going to give you the truck.

807
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:59,827
So this is kind of a strange
pragmatic situation where

808
00:32:59,827 --> 00:33:02,160
the experimenter actually
gave the child the object they

809
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,040
wanted, but she expressed a
misunderstanding of the child's

810
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,790
request.

811
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:07,530
And this is the
crucial case here.

812
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:10,740
So the question is,
obviously, in the case where

813
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,270
the experimenter
provides the thing

814
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:15,960
and expresses understanding,
children should be quite happy.

815
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,610
And in this situation,
they probably

816
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:20,172
shouldn't be very happy.

817
00:33:20,172 --> 00:33:21,630
And what the
experimenters measured

818
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:23,940
was the amount of
times that the child

819
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:26,820
repeated the label of the
object that they had asked for.

820
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:30,150
And they also measured
other behaviors as well.

821
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:34,155
It's this situation that's
important for understanding

822
00:33:34,155 --> 00:33:35,970
what kids care
about in the context

823
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:37,560
of this communicative
interaction.

824
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,342
So the question is, are
infants perfectly happy here

825
00:33:40,342 --> 00:33:42,300
to take the truck and
not complain because they

826
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,410
got what they wanted?

827
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:45,810
Or do they care about the
experimenter giving them

828
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:49,080
what they wanted because
their communicated message had

829
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:53,820
the proper effect
on the addressee?

830
00:33:53,820 --> 00:34:00,390
And what they find is that when
the correct object is provided,

831
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:02,520
and the experimenter does
not express understanding

832
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,144
of the request,
infants actually showed

833
00:34:04,144 --> 00:34:06,660
the most repetitions of the
name of the requested object

834
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,260
in this case.

835
00:34:10,686 --> 00:34:12,475
The researchers
concluded from this

836
00:34:12,475 --> 00:34:14,850
that infants don't just care
about getting what they want

837
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:19,710
or using communication
as a sort of instrumental

838
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,690
means of getting people
to act in certain ways,

839
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:26,699
but rather as an intention to
have their messages understood

840
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:29,811
and delivered to
the other person.

841
00:34:29,811 --> 00:34:32,310
So they care about the impact
of their communicative signals

842
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:33,929
on the understanding
of the addressee,

843
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:36,102
not just on the response
of the addressee,

844
00:34:36,102 --> 00:34:38,310
which is sort of like the
idea that Grice was talking

845
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:40,320
about with speaker meaning.

846
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,570
Similarly, when
children are responding

847
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:44,820
to other people's requests,
they also care about this.

848
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:47,280
So this is a study that
I did in graduate school.

849
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,230
It's sort of the opposite of the
previous study, or the inverse.

850
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:53,580
So we had an experimenter
requesting from the child

851
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:57,380
specific objects for
doing specific tasks.

852
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,530
This is 3-year-olds.

853
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:00,960
So she would request
something like a cup

854
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,670
to pour a cup of water.

855
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:05,340
The child had previous
information from playing games

856
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,110
with the objects with
another experimenter

857
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:09,037
that one of the cups
was perfectly fine,

858
00:35:09,037 --> 00:35:10,620
and one of the cups
was broken and had

859
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,540
a big hole in the bottom.

860
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,670
And so when the experimenter
asked for a cup,

861
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:17,440
the child could either give the
cup the experimenter asked for,

862
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,479
which was sometimes
the perfectly good cup,

863
00:35:20,479 --> 00:35:22,770
or sometimes the experimenter
requested the broken cup.

864
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:26,400
And the question was, do
children pay attention

865
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,290
to the fit between
the task and what

866
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:30,420
the experimenter
wanted when they're

867
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,430
responding to her request?

868
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:36,120
And what we found is that
children were much more

869
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,800
likely to give the
requested object when

870
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,320
the experimenter had requested
a functional object than when

871
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,920
she'd requested a
dysfunctional object.

872
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,711
So if I say, I need to
pour a cup of water,

873
00:35:43,711 --> 00:35:45,870
can you give me that cup,
and the cup is broken,

874
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:49,770
children tended to go and get
a better cup instead of the one

875
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:51,570
that I had requested.

876
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:54,570
Interestingly, though, even
though children did this,

877
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:57,240
it didn't seem to be enough for
them to give the experimenter

878
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,770
something good that she wanted.

879
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:00,660
This is a graph of the
comments that children

880
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,460
made about the
function of the objects

881
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,300
depending on the kind of
request that was made.

882
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,800
And what you can see is that
when a dysfunctional object was

883
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,200
requested, when children
tended to provide

884
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,115
the functional object instead
and not respond to the request,

885
00:36:13,115 --> 00:36:14,490
they were much
more likely to try

886
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:17,010
to explain their behavior
to the experimenter

887
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:20,190
and acknowledge what it was
the experiment had originally

888
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,060
wanted.

889
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,521
So it seems like children
in their own behavior,

890
00:36:23,521 --> 00:36:25,270
by at least three,
which is a little older

891
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:27,942
than the other
studies, acknowledge

892
00:36:27,942 --> 00:36:30,400
what the speaker meant to ask
for and explain while they're

893
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,109
doing something else,
even when they're not

894
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:34,150
responding to that thing.

895
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,005
And so, just briefly,
in the last section,

896
00:36:39,005 --> 00:36:41,130
I'll talk about a third
insight about communication

897
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:42,810
that I think is really
important, which

898
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:45,210
comes from Clark, which
is that communication

899
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:49,480
is this joint action of
accumulating common ground.

900
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,530
And so in an example of
an adult study about this,

901
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:55,770
they showed adults pictures
like this one of New York City,

902
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:58,119
and they had people
play this game in pairs.

903
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:00,660
They had people who knew about
New York City who were experts

904
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,530
and who lived
there, and then they

905
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:04,113
had other people who didn't know
anything about New York City.

906
00:37:04,113 --> 00:37:06,720
And they gave them
a bunch of pictures.

907
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,910
They told them that
their goal was to--

908
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:12,630
the person who was
the addressee had

909
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:15,600
to sort the objects in the way
that the communicator told them

910
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,230
to.

911
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,720
And so as a communicator, the
communicator had to indicate,

912
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,140
because they couldn't see
the pictures, which picture

913
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,940
the addressee should put where.

914
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:26,880
And to do this, the
communicator had

915
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,330
to refer to things like the
picture with the Empire State

916
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:31,830
Building in it.

917
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:35,430
And what they looked at was how
people in these interactions

918
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:38,490
accumulated shared knowledge
or common ground over time

919
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:40,650
and coordinated so their
communication could

920
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:41,709
become more efficient.

921
00:37:41,709 --> 00:37:44,250
And what they found is that when
they had two New Yorkers who

922
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:45,624
were interacting
with each other,

923
00:37:45,624 --> 00:37:49,037
they tended to very quickly
do the task because they could

924
00:37:49,037 --> 00:37:51,120
recognize immediately,
that person's a New Yorker,

925
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,380
and would just say
things like, oh, it's

926
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,030
the one with the
Empire State Building.

927
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,890
Whereas when they were talking
to someone who wasn't a New

928
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:58,200
Yorker, they had to sort
of ground the conversation

929
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,990
by establishing these common
reference before getting

930
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:01,774
to this point.

931
00:38:01,774 --> 00:38:03,940
And so they might start out
with saying things like,

932
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:07,280
oh, move the one with the
building with the pointy top.

933
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,030
And then eventually,
they would coordinate

934
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:13,450
on what the actual labels
for these things were.

935
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:16,260
And so Clark's idea
is that communication

936
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,210
is really efficient,
and we're able to do it

937
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:20,987
in the way we are
because we're thinking

938
00:38:20,987 --> 00:38:23,070
about the common ground
we have with other people.

939
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,900
And we're able to figure out
what kind of common ground

940
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,610
we have with others
fairly quickly.

941
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:28,470
So if I'm interacting
with one of you,

942
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:31,290
I might assume, OK, we both know
a lot about cognitive science

943
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:31,920
already.

944
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,570
So I can sort of start
at a different level

945
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:35,670
than I might start with, say,
a child or someone who didn't

946
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:36,990
know anything about this area.

947
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:43,325
And so this is an important
piece of human communication.

948
00:38:43,325 --> 00:38:45,450
It seems like-- and Liz
talked a little about this,

949
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:47,116
too-- it seems like
infants are starting

950
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:49,502
to show some signs
of understanding

951
00:38:49,502 --> 00:38:51,210
the importance of
common ground or shared

952
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:54,180
knowledge in communication
from a really early age.

953
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,640
But importantly, this seems to
come in around the same time

954
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,556
that they recognize the
importance of speakers

955
00:38:58,556 --> 00:39:00,325
facing each other
in conversation

956
00:39:00,325 --> 00:39:02,700
and perhaps putting together
some of their core knowledge

957
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:07,200
domains, which is around
nine months to a year.

958
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,330
A lot of work in
this domain has been

959
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:12,411
done by Tomasello, who showed
that around nine months,

960
00:39:12,411 --> 00:39:14,910
children were starting to do
something different than they'd

961
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:15,701
been doing earlier.

962
00:39:15,701 --> 00:39:19,610
So under nine months,
children tend to--

963
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:22,230
they play with objects,
they interact with people,

964
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:25,480
but they don't seem to put
these two things together.

965
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,750
Whereas at nine months,
what they start doing

966
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:30,510
is paying attention, not
just to objects or to people,

967
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:33,360
but to objects and people at
the same time in the context

968
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,780
of a joint interaction.

969
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:37,050
So they might do things
like look at an object

970
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:40,860
and then look at mom to make
sure mom is also looking at it.

971
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,780
Or they might point
at things, not just

972
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,030
because they want the things,
as a younger child might

973
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:48,750
do, but only to share
attention with a parent

974
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:50,239
or with someone
else to point out

975
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:51,780
that they're interested
in something,

976
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,863
and to make sure that the
parent is looking and is

977
00:39:53,863 --> 00:39:56,070
interested in it as well.

978
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:58,710
So Tomasello argues
that this ability

979
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:03,780
for engaging in joint attention,
sharing attention with someone

980
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,570
else, to an object or
external referent in the world

981
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,210
is the foundation of
linguistic communication

982
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:12,150
and also cooperation in
other very important human

983
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,980
activities.

984
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,740
And it's certainly going to be
important for an understanding

985
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:21,352
of common ground, which is
important for communication.

986
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:23,310
So there's also evidence
that around 12 months,

987
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:25,245
infants start to use
prior shared experience

988
00:40:25,245 --> 00:40:26,370
to interpret communication.

989
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:27,900
I'm going to skip this, I think.

990
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:28,995
But basically, the idea--

991
00:40:28,995 --> 00:40:30,620
well, I'll just go
through it quickly--

992
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:33,900
the idea is that infants will
use the activities and objects

993
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,632
that they've shared
with people previously

994
00:40:36,632 --> 00:40:38,715
to figure out what the
person means in a new case.

995
00:40:38,715 --> 00:40:41,550
So if the infant interacts with
one communicator with one toy

996
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:43,633
and with another communicator
with a different toy

997
00:40:43,633 --> 00:40:47,220
separately, they will
figure out the referent

998
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,020
of a communicator's
ambiguous request

999
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,520
by thinking about
what information

1000
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,880
they've shared in the past.

1001
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,860
So it seems like
they're starting

1002
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,610
to track what kinds
of knowledge is shared

1003
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:57,090
and what isn't in order
to effectively communicate

1004
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:57,600
with others.

1005
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,535
OK.

1006
00:41:05,535 --> 00:41:07,410
So there's a lot of
other important questions

1007
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:09,618
about common ground, but
I'm going to skip those now.

1008
00:41:09,618 --> 00:41:13,355
I just want to come back
to the question of why

1009
00:41:13,355 --> 00:41:15,480
infants' understanding and
children's understanding

1010
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,438
of communication is
important for understanding

1011
00:41:17,438 --> 00:41:19,480
human intelligence.

1012
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,210
So I think that one
reason is that when

1013
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:25,080
you think about the insights
these philosophers had

1014
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:28,680
and how they seemed
to be realized

1015
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,720
in fairly young infants early--

1016
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,419
children and infants
early in development,

1017
00:41:33,419 --> 00:41:35,460
when you look at these
abilities that humans have

1018
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:38,880
and even that very young humans
have, and you compare them

1019
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,650
to what nonhuman
animals are doing,

1020
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:44,220
things look really different.

1021
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:48,180
And so, just briefly,
in animal communication,

1022
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,890
we see some of the
same kinds of features

1023
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:51,790
that we see in
human communication.

1024
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:53,850
So for one thing, animal
communication clearly

1025
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:55,470
has a social function
in the same way

1026
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:57,190
that human communication does.

1027
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:59,815
So it's socially rich
in a number of ways.

1028
00:41:59,815 --> 00:42:01,440
I'm not going to over
specific species,

1029
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,030
but just to gloss over it,
most animal communication

1030
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:05,994
is sensitive to the
presence of an audience.

1031
00:42:05,994 --> 00:42:07,410
So it matters that
someone's there

1032
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:09,360
to hear your communication.

1033
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,890
For example,
species that produce

1034
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:15,159
alarm calls to warn others
in their group of predators

1035
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:17,700
will rarely produce these calls
if there are no other members

1036
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,560
of their species present.

1037
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,810
In many cases, the
sensitivity to the audience

1038
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:23,920
depends on the identity
of the audience.

1039
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,950
So for example, in some species
such as ground squirrels,

1040
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:28,950
they call much more in
the presence of their kin

1041
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:30,366
than when their
kin are not around

1042
00:42:30,366 --> 00:42:32,654
or when there are other
individuals there.

1043
00:42:32,654 --> 00:42:35,070
And in some cases, it seems
like there might actually even

1044
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:36,330
be a sensitivity
to the knowledge

1045
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:37,246
state of the audience.

1046
00:42:37,246 --> 00:42:39,180
So this is looking a
little more like the kind

1047
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,970
of sophisticated communication
we see in humans.

1048
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:44,010
So a wild chimpanzee,
for example,

1049
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:46,350
will produce an alarm call,
will start to alarm call

1050
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:48,210
more if other
chimpanzees come over

1051
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:50,670
who hadn't heard the
original alarm call

1052
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:52,290
or who hadn't seen the predator.

1053
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:53,760
But if everyone around
has already seen it,

1054
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,218
they'll reduce
their alarm calling.

1055
00:42:55,218 --> 00:42:57,690
So it seems like they tailor
it to how much information

1056
00:42:57,690 --> 00:42:58,860
others around them have had.

1057
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:04,020
However, despite these
really interesting ways

1058
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:07,170
in which animal communication
is social and complex,

1059
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:08,760
it's also limited
in a number of ways

1060
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,500
that human communication is not.

1061
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:13,320
So the eliciting stimuli for
these communicative signals

1062
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,720
tend to be fairly limited,
as do the signals themselves.

1063
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,553
So there tends to be,
say in vervet monkeys,

1064
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:19,830
one cry for a hawk and
one cry for a snake,

1065
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:22,590
and they can't
realize new signals

1066
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:26,310
for new kinds of
predators and situations.

1067
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:28,980
As in humans, the
receivers-- or in humans,

1068
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,510
the addressees--
acquire information

1069
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:32,820
from the signals of others,
but there's no evidence

1070
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:37,140
that this information tells
the receivers in animal species

1071
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:41,457
anything about the mental
states of the communicator.

1072
00:43:41,457 --> 00:43:43,290
And additionally, the
communicator's signals

1073
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:45,470
can often cause a response
in receivers that's

1074
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:46,770
beneficial to the communicator.

1075
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:49,080
For example, they get a
bump to indirect fitness

1076
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:53,160
if they're kin run away
and survive predators.

1077
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:56,130
So there can be benefits
of communication,

1078
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:58,380
but there's no evidence
that the communicator

1079
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:01,419
has any intention of changing
the receiver's mental state.

1080
00:44:01,419 --> 00:44:03,960
So there's really no evidence
of this sort of speaker meaning

1081
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,570
or this special kind of
communicative intention

1082
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:09,600
we see in humans, which is that
a communicator doesn't just

1083
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,780
intend for the addressee to
respond in a particular way,

1084
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:16,830
but intends for the audience
to respond in a particular way

1085
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:19,170
by virtue of having
understood the intention

1086
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:21,480
of that communication.

1087
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:25,110
And so this is just a, I think,
particularly well-worded quote

1088
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:27,330
from Seyfarth and
Cheney who say basically

1089
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:30,570
that listeners can acquire
information from signallers,

1090
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:33,030
but the signallers themselves
don't, in the human sense,

1091
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:37,064
intend to provide
that information.

1092
00:44:37,064 --> 00:44:38,730
So the reason, really,
for this contrast

1093
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:40,470
between the human
and animal cases

1094
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:45,447
that I think if we want to build
a model of human communication,

1095
00:44:45,447 --> 00:44:47,280
we need to differentiate
it from other kinds

1096
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,890
of communicative
models we could have.

1097
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:50,910
And we also need it to
develop the types of abilities

1098
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:52,650
that human infants have,
but taking into account

1099
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:54,358
the resources that
infants start out with

1100
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:58,396
and the developments that we see
in the first few years of life.

1101
00:44:58,396 --> 00:45:00,270
So it's not going to be
enough to have agents

1102
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:01,978
that can influence
each other's responses

1103
00:45:01,978 --> 00:45:04,034
or who can understand
language, because it

1104
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:06,450
seems like the recognition of
these more abstract features

1105
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:08,783
of communication and its
causal effects on mental states

1106
00:45:08,783 --> 00:45:11,520
is actually present
fairly early on as well.

1107
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:15,720
And I think just relating
this back to Liz's theory

1108
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,330
that infants might have these
different systems for agents,

1109
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:19,740
understanding agents
and their actions

1110
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:22,240
on objects and then for social
beings and their interactions

1111
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:22,990
with each other.

1112
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:24,570
It seems like
communication and this type

1113
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:25,986
of communicative
intention that we

1114
00:45:25,986 --> 00:45:29,580
see combines these two kinds
of things, where you have

1115
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:32,370
an intention to produce
an effect on someone else,

1116
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:35,340
but by virtue of them
understanding the mental states

1117
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:39,000
that you have toward the world
and as well as toward them.

1118
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,820
And maybe it's the combining
of these different domains that

1119
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:47,550
helps infants put
together their possibly

1120
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:50,990
human-unique, but maybe
not, communication skills.
