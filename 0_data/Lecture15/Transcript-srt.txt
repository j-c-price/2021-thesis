1
00:00:14,297 --> 00:00:15,150
MICHALE FEE: OK.

2
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,770
So let's go ahead
and get started.

3
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:22,700
So what is neural computation?

4
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:27,740
So neuroscience used to be
a very descriptive field

5
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,070
where you would describe the
different kinds of neurons.

6
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:36,800
Who here has seen the famous
pictures-- the old pictures

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,970
of the golgi-stained neurons,
all those different types

8
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:46,610
of neurons, describing what
things look like in the brain

9
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,760
and what parts of the brain
are important for what

10
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,540
kinds of behavior based
on lesion studies.

11
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,520
It used to be
extremely descriptive.

12
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,710
But things are changing
in neuroscience,

13
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,540
and have changed dramatically
over the past few decades.

14
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:06,060
Really, neuroscience now is
about understanding the brain,

15
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,660
how the brain works, how
the brain produces behavior.

16
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:12,500
And really trying to develop
engineering-level descriptions

17
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,820
of brain systems and brain
circuits and neurons and ion

18
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,660
channels and all the components
of neurons that make the brain

19
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:20,160
work.

20
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:26,210
And so, for example,
the level of description

21
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:30,590
that my lab works at and
that I'm most excited about

22
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,250
is understanding how neural
circuits-- how neurons

23
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,100
are put together to make
neural circuits that

24
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:42,290
implement behaviors,
or to produce

25
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:43,800
let's say object recognition.

26
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,770
So this is a figure
from Jim DiCarlo,

27
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,080
who is our department head.

28
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,360
Basically a
circuit-level description

29
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,790
of how the brain goes
from a visual stimulus

30
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:58,960
to a recognition of what that
object is in the stimulus.

31
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,370
Now at the same
time that there's

32
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:05,040
been a big push toward
understanding or generating

33
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,090
an engineering level
descriptions of brains

34
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,970
and circuits and
components, neurons,

35
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:16,010
there's also been tremendous
advances in the technologies

36
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,740
that we can use
to record neurons.

37
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:24,590
So there are now imaging
systems and microscopes

38
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:28,020
that can image thousands
of neurons simultaneously.

39
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:35,360
This is an example of a movie
recorded in an awake baby mouse

40
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,510
that's basically dreaming.

41
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,310
And let me just show you
what this looks like.

42
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,940
So this is a mouse that has
a fluorescent protein that's

43
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,340
sensitive to neural activity.

44
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,460
And so when neurons in a part
of the brain become active

45
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,690
they become fluorescent
and light up.

46
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:58,450
And so here's a top surface
of the mouse's brain.

47
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:03,070
And you can see this spontaneous
activity flickering around

48
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:06,010
as this mouse is just
dreaming and thinking

49
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:10,050
about whatever it's
thinking about.

50
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:15,540
So one of the key
challenges is to take images

51
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,480
like this that represent
the activity of thousands

52
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,490
of neurons or
millions of neurons

53
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:24,990
and figure out how to relate
that to the circuit models that

54
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,080
are being developed.

55
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,020
So here's another example.

56
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,220
So there are these new probes
where these are basically

57
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,620
silicon probes
that have thousands

58
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,250
of little sensors on
them and a computer here

59
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,600
that basically reads out
the pattern of activity.

60
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,430
These are called neuropixels.

61
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,580
So those are
basically electrodes

62
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,640
that can, again, record
from thousands of neurons

63
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,630
simultaneously.

64
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:51,030
And they're quite
long and can record

65
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,260
throughout the whole brain,
essentially, all at once.

66
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,090
So the key now is you have these
very high dimensional data set.

67
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:04,020
How do you relate that
to the circuit models

68
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,140
that you're developing?

69
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,370
And so one of the key
challenges in neuroscience

70
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,660
is to take very
large data sets that

71
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,120
look like this that
just look like a mess

72
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,870
and figure out what's going
on underneath of there.

73
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:22,110
It turns out that people are
discovering that while you

74
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:25,270
might be recording from
tens of thousands of neurons

75
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,910
and it looks really
messy that there's

76
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:31,140
some underlying very simple
structure underneath of there.

77
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,790
But you can't see
it when you just

78
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:39,030
look at big collections
of neurons like this.

79
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:42,240
So the challenge here
is really to figure out

80
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,340
how to not only just
make those models,

81
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,035
but test them by taking
data and relating

82
00:04:48,035 --> 00:04:50,160
the patterns of activity
that you see in these very

83
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,810
high dimensional data sets,
do dimensionality reduction--

84
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,470
compress that data down into
a simple representation--

85
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:01,980
and then relate it to those
models that you developed.

86
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,500
One of the things we're going
to try to do in this class

87
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:13,500
is to apply these techniques
of making models of neurons

88
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,100
and circuits together
with mathematical tools

89
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,180
for analyzing data in
the context of looking

90
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,730
at animal behaviors.

91
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:31,740
So for example, in my lab
we study how songbirds sing,

92
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,230
how they learn to produce
their vocalizations.

93
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,270
Songbirds learn by
imitating their parents.

94
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,108
They listen to their parents.

[BIRDS SINGING]

96
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,640
Here, hold on.

97
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,422
I'm going to skip ahead.

98
00:05:54,422 --> 00:05:55,901
How do I do that?

99
00:05:55,901 --> 00:06:00,338
[BIRDS SINGING]

100
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:06,254
[INAUDIBLE] bring up the--

101
00:06:06,254 --> 00:06:08,719
I was hoping I'd be
able to skip ahead.

102
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,610
So this is just a
setup showing how

103
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:21,090
we can record from neurons in
birds while they're singing

104
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,920
and figure out how
those circuits work

105
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,510
to produce the song.

106
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,010
This is a little
micro-drive that we built.

107
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:30,120
It's motorized so that we
can move these electrodes

108
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,110
around independently in the
brain and record from neurons

109
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,840
without the animal knowing that
we're moving the electrodes

110
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,870
around and looking for neurons.

111
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,110
So songbirds are really cool.

112
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,420
They listen to their parents.

113
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,760
They store a memory of
what their parents sing.

114
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,470
And then they begin babbling.

115
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:49,500
And they practice over and
over again until they can learn

116
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,920
a good copy of their song.

117
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,160
So here's a bird that's
singing with the micro-drive

118
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,930
on its head.

119
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,075
And you can hear the
neuron in the background.

Sorry, it's not over
the loudspeaker here.

122
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,690
But can everyone hear that?

123
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,485
So we can record from neurons
while the bird is singing.

124
00:07:06,485 --> 00:07:07,110
[BIRDS SINGING]

125
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:10,050
Look at the activity
in this network

126
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,960
and try to figure out
how that network actually

127
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,880
works to produce the song.

128
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,740
And also we can record
in very young birds

129
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:22,050
and figure out how the
song is actually learned.

130
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:26,850
And there's an example
of a neuron generating

131
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:31,920
action potentials, which is
the basic unit of communication

132
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,550
in the brain.

133
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:37,540
[BIRDS SINGING]

134
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,440
And we try to build
circuit models

135
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,248
and figure out how that
thing actually works

136
00:07:44,248 --> 00:07:45,540
to produce and learn this song.

137
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,930
So these computational
approaches

138
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,490
that I'm talking
about are not just

139
00:07:55,490 --> 00:08:00,120
important for dissecting brain
circuits related to behavior.

140
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,320
The same kinds of
approaches, the same kind

141
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,640
of dimensionality reduction
techniques we're going to learn

142
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:12,160
are also useful in
molecular genetic studies,

143
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,395
like taking
transcriptional profiling

144
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:18,020
and doing clustering and looking
at the different patterns that

145
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:18,520
are there.

146
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,230
It's also useful for
molecular studies.

147
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:27,050
Also, these ideas are very
powerful in studying cognition.

148
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,480
So if you look at the work
that Josh Tenenbaum does

149
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:34,400
and Josh McDermott, who
developed mathematical models

150
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:39,020
of how our minds work, how we
learn to think about things,

151
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:42,027
those are also very model-based
and very quantitative.

152
00:08:42,027 --> 00:08:44,360
So the kinds of tools we're
going to learn in this class

153
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,610
are very broadly applicable.

154
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:50,040
They're also increasingly
important in medicine.

155
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,890
So at some point we're going to
take a little bit of a detour

156
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:58,910
to look at a particular
disease that's caused

157
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:02,042
by a defect in an ion channel.

158
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,500
And it turns out
you can understand

159
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,590
exactly how that defect
in that ion channel

160
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:11,260
relates to the phenotype
of the disease.

161
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:15,260
And you can do that by creating
a mathematical model of how

162
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,440
a neuron behaves when it
has an ion channel that

163
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,210
has this defect in it.

164
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:20,960
So it's very cool.

165
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,790
And once you model
it, you can really

166
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,125
understand why that happens.

167
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,500
So here are some of
the course goals.

168
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,110
So we're going to
start by working

169
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,750
on basic biophysics of
neurons and networks

170
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:38,280
and other principles underlying
brain and cognitive functions.

171
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,530
We're going to develop
mathematical techniques

172
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:46,020
to analyze those models and
to analyze the behavioral data

173
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,060
and neural data
that you would take

174
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,580
to study those brain circuits.

175
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,720
And along the way, we're going
to become proficient at using

176
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,170
MATLAB to do these things.

177
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:01,670
So how many of you have
experience with MATLAB?

178
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,960
OK, great.

179
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,510
And not?

180
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:09,050
So anybody who doesn't have
experience with MATLAB,

181
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:12,830
we're going to really make
an effort to bring you up

182
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:14,720
to speed very quickly.

183
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,440
Daniel has actually just
created a very nice MATLAB cheat

184
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,870
sheet that's just amazing.

185
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:26,110
So there will be lots of
help with programming.

186
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,840
So let me just mention
some of the topics

187
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,010
that we'll be covering.

188
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:32,370
So we'll be talking
about equivalent circuit

189
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:35,715
model of neurons.

190
00:10:35,715 --> 00:10:38,320
So let me just explain
how this is broken down.

191
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,560
So these are topics
that we'll be covering.

192
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,080
And these are the
mathematical tools

193
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,150
that go along with
those topics that we'll

194
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,790
be learning about in parallel.

195
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,220
So we'll be studying
neuronal biophysics.

196
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,620
And we'll be doing some
differential equations

197
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,230
along the way for that, just
first-order linear differential

198
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:58,020
equations, nothing
to be scared of.

199
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,910
We'll talk about
neuronal responses

200
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,830
to stimuli and tuning curves.

201
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,330
And along the way,
we'll be learning

202
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,000
about spike sorting and
peristimulus, time histograms,

203
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,330
and ways of analyzing
firing patterns.

204
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:13,060
We talked about neural
coding and receptive fields.

205
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,270
And we'll learn about
correlation and convolution

206
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,270
for that topic.

207
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,617
We'll talk about feed forward
networks and perceptrons.

208
00:11:19,617 --> 00:11:21,200
And then we're going
to start bringing

209
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,890
a lot of linear algebra,
which is really fun.

210
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,320
It's really powerful.

211
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,590
And that linear
algebra sets the stage

212
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,170
for then doing
dimensionality, reduction

213
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:36,890
on data, and principal component
analysis, and singular value

214
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:39,580
decomposition, and other things.

215
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:44,590
We'll then take an additional
extension of neural networks

216
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,940
from feed forward networks.

217
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,130
We'll figure out how
to make them talk back

218
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:50,590
to themselves so they
can start doing things

219
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:54,790
like remember things
and make decisions.

220
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:59,170
And that involves more
linear algebra, eigenvalues.

221
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:01,340
And then I'm not
sure we're going

222
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:06,070
to get time to sensory
integration and Bayes' rule.

223
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,720
So by the end of
the class, there

224
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,180
are some important
skills that you'll have.

225
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:16,180
You'll be able to think
about a neuron very clearly

226
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:19,120
and how its components
work together

227
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,220
to give that neuron
its properties.

228
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,060
And how neurons themselves
can connect together

229
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,580
to give a neural
circuit its properties.

230
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:33,030
You'll be able to write
MATLAB programs that

231
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,770
simulate those models.

232
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:38,760
You'll be able to analyze
data using MATLAB.

233
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,850
You'll be able to visualize
high dimensional data sets.

234
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:44,970
And one of my
goals in this class

235
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:47,010
is that you guys
should be able to go

236
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:51,390
into any lab in the
department and do

237
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,910
cool things that even the
graduate students may not

238
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,840
know how to do.

239
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,200
And so you can do really
great stuff as a UROP.

240
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:10,360
So one of the most important
things about this class

241
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,130
is problem sets
because that's where

242
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:15,610
you're going to get the hands-on
experience to do that data

243
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:21,280
analysis and write programs
and analyze the data.

244
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,240
Please install that.

245
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,290
It's really important, if
you don't already have that.

246
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:30,010
We use live scripts for
problems set submissions.

247
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:33,510
And Daniel made some
nice examples on Stellar.

248
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:36,830
And of course the guidelines
for Pset submissions

249
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,810
are also on Stellar.

250
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:40,888
OK, that's it.

251
00:13:40,888 --> 00:13:41,930
Any questions about that?

252
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,850
No?

253
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,050
All right, good.

254
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:51,430
So let's go ahead
and get started then

255
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,375
with the first topic.

256
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,210
OK.

257
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:04,750
So the first thing
we're going to do

258
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:10,150
is we're going to build
a model of a neuron.

259
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,550
This model is very particular.

260
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:18,890
It uses electrical components
to describe the neuron.

261
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:22,630
Now that may not be surprising
since a neuron is basically

262
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,220
an electrical device.

263
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,370
It has components that
are sensitive to voltages,

264
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,400
that generate currents,
that control currents.

265
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,820
And so we're going to build our
model using electrical circuit

266
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,580
components.

267
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,030
And one of the nice
things about doing that

268
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:40,370
is that every electrical
circuit component,

269
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,640
like a resistor or
a capacitor, has

270
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:47,950
a very well-defined mathematical
relation between the current

271
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,260
and the voltage,
the current that

272
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,870
flows through that
device and the voltage

273
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,670
across the terminals
of that device.

274
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:58,300
So you can write down very
precisely, mathematically,

275
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:02,040
what each of those
components does.

276
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:07,050
So then you can then
take all those components

277
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:12,270
and construct a set of
equations or in general a set

278
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:16,890
of differential equations that
allows you to basically evolve

279
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:19,950
that circuit over time
and plot, let's say,

280
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:23,530
the voltage on the inside of
the cell as a function of time.

281
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:27,390
And you can see that that
model neuron can actually

282
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:33,410
very precisely replicate many
of the properties of neurons.

283
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:37,010
Now neurons are actually
really complicated.

284
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:40,850
And this is the real reason why
we need to write down a model.

285
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,740
So there are many
different kinds of neurons.

286
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,500
Each type of neuron
has a different pattern

287
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,800
of genes that are expressed.

288
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,530
So this is a cluster
diagram of neuron type based

289
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:55,760
on a transcriptional
profiling of the RNA

290
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,000
that I think it was about 13,000
neurons that were extracted

291
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,830
from a part of the brain.

292
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,420
You do a transcriptional
profiling.

293
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,880
It gives you a map of
all the different genes

294
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,908
are expressed in each neuron.

295
00:16:06,908 --> 00:16:08,450
And then you can
cluster them and you

296
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:11,480
can see that this particular
part of the brain,

297
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,200
which is in the
hypothalamus, expresses all

298
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,672
of these different cell types.

299
00:16:17,672 --> 00:16:19,130
Now what are those
different genes?

300
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:21,170
Many of those different
genes are actually

301
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:22,430
different ion channels.

302
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:26,090
And there are hundreds of
different kinds of ion channels

303
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:29,300
that control the flow of
current across the membrane

304
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,600
of the neuron.

305
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,610
So this is just a diagram
showing different potassium ion

306
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,160
channels, different
calcium ion channels.

307
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,505
You can see they have families
and different subtypes.

308
00:16:41,505 --> 00:16:43,130
And all of those
different ion channels

309
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:45,110
have different
timescales on which

310
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:48,230
the current varies as a
function of voltage change.

311
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,090
They have different
voltage ranges

312
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:51,770
that they're sensitive to.

313
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,420
They have different
inactivation.

314
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:56,610
So many ion channels, when you
turn them on, they stay on.

315
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:58,700
But other ion
channels, they turn on

316
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,640
and then they slowly decay away.

317
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,170
The current slowly decays away.

318
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,609
And that's called inactivation.

319
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:06,109
And all these
different ion channels

320
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:08,960
have different combinations
of those properties.

321
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,290
And it's really
hard to predict when

322
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:15,319
you think about how
this neuron will

323
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:18,450
behave with a different
kind of ion channel here.

324
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:22,579
It's super hard to just look
at the properties of an ion

325
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:25,332
channel and just see how that's
going to work in a neuron

326
00:17:25,332 --> 00:17:27,290
because you have all
these different parts that

327
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:29,285
are working together.

328
00:17:29,285 --> 00:17:31,790
And so it's really important
to be able to write down

329
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:32,990
a mathematical model.

330
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:35,930
If you have a neuron that has a
different kind of ion channel,

331
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:40,400
you can actually predict how
the neuron's going to behave.

332
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,970
Now that's just the
ion channel components.

333
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:47,010
Neurons also have
complex morphologies.

334
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:52,220
This is a Purkinje
cell in the cerebellum.

335
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:56,240
They have these very densely
elaborated dendrites.

336
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,160
Other neurons have
very long dendrites

337
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,990
with just a few branches.

338
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:02,960
Other neurons have very
short stubby dendrites.

339
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,670
And each of those different
morphological patterns

340
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:12,440
also affects how a neuron
responds to its inputs,

341
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,020
because now a neuron
can have inputs

342
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,450
out here at the end of
the dendrite or up close

343
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:19,340
to the soma.

344
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:22,640
And all of those, the
spatial structure,

345
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,700
also affects how
a neuron responds.

346
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,310
And those produce very
different firing patterns.

347
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:31,760
So some neurons, if you
put in a constant current,

348
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,130
they just fire regularly up.

349
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:37,070
So it turns out we
can really understand

350
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:41,360
why all these
different things happen

351
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,030
if we build a model like this.

352
00:18:47,265 --> 00:18:48,640
So let me just
point out a couple

353
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,560
of other interesting
things about this model.

354
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,390
Different parts of
this circuit actually

355
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:54,610
do cool different things.

356
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:58,300
So neurons have not
just one power supply.

357
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,767
They've got multiple
power supplies to power

358
00:19:00,767 --> 00:19:02,350
up different parts
of the circuit that

359
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:05,290
do different things.

360
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:08,380
Neurons have
capacitances that allow

361
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:14,050
a neuron to accumulate over
time, act as an integrator.

362
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:17,470
If you combine a
capacitor with a resistor,

363
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:20,200
that circuit now
looks like a filter.

364
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,430
It smooths its past
inputs over time.

365
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,430
And these two components
here, this sodium current

366
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:30,790
and this potassium current,
make a spike generator

367
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,650
that generates an
action potential that

368
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:34,930
then talks to other neurons.

369
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,610
And you put that
whole thing together,

370
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,620
and that thing can act
like an oscillator.

371
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,900
It can act like a
coincidence detector.

372
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:44,800
It can do all kinds of
different cool things.

373
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,170
And all that stuff
is understandable

374
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:52,490
if you just write down a
simple model like this.

375
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,533
Any questions?

376
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,360
So what we're going
to do is we're

377
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:04,610
going to just start
describing this network.

378
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:07,880
We're going to build it
up one piece at a time.

379
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:13,260
And we're going to start
with a capacitance.

380
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,990
But before we get
to the capacitor,

381
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,820
we need to do one more thing.

382
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,620
We need to do one
thing first, which

383
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,760
is figure out what the
wires are in the brain.

384
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,220
For an electrical circuit,
you need to have wires.

385
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:30,700
So what are the
wires in the brain?

386
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,110
What do wires do in a circuit?

387
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:35,890
They carry current.

388
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:42,060
So what are the
wires in a neuron?

389
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,388
AUDIENCE: Axons?

390
00:20:43,388 --> 00:20:44,430
MICHALE FEE: What's that?

391
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:45,142
AUDIENCE: Axons?

392
00:20:45,142 --> 00:20:46,170
MICHALE FEE: Axons.

393
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:48,580
So axons carry information.

394
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,110
They carry a spike that
travels down the axon

395
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,430
and goes to other neurons.

396
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:57,940
But there is even a
simpler answer than that.

397
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,440
Yes?

398
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,691
AUDIENCE: Ion channels?

399
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:03,600
MICHALE FEE: Ion channels
are these resistors here.

400
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,084
But what is it that connects all
those components to each other?

401
00:21:08,084 --> 00:21:09,834
AUDIENCE: Intracellular
and extracellular.

402
00:21:09,834 --> 00:21:10,930
MICHALE FEE: Excellent.

403
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:14,680
It's the intracellular and
extracellular solution.

404
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,810
And so what we're
going to do today

405
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:20,530
is to understand how the
intracellular and extracellular

406
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:25,420
solution acts as a
wire in our neuron.

407
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:31,150
And it's not quite as
simple as a piece of metal.

408
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:32,800
It's a bit more complicated.

409
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,570
There are different
ways you can get

410
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:39,315
current flow in intracellular
and extracellular solution.

411
00:21:39,315 --> 00:21:40,690
So we're going to
go through that

412
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:43,630
and we're going to analyze
that in some detail.

413
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:53,200
So in the brain, the wires
are the intracellular

414
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,480
and extracellular
salt solutions.

415
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,240
And you get current
flow that results

416
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,730
from the movement of ions
in that aqueous solution.

417
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:07,420
So the solution
consists of ions.

418
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:10,690
Like in the
extracellular, it's mostly

419
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:15,080
sodium ions and chloride ions
that are dissolved in water.

420
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,630
Water is a polar solvent.

421
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:19,970
That means that the negative
parts, the oxygen that's

422
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:21,520
slightly negatively charged.

423
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,810
Oxygen is attracted
toward positive ions.

424
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:28,540
And the intracellular
and extracellular space

425
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,120
are filled with salt
solution at a concentration

426
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,091
of about 100 millimolar.

427
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,430
And that corresponds
to having one

428
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:45,310
of these ions about
every 25 angstroms apart.

429
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:49,200
So at those
concentrations, there

430
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,580
are a lot of ions
floating around.

431
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:57,000
And those ions can move
under different conditions

432
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,540
to produce currents.

433
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:03,620
So currents flow in
the brain through two

434
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,450
primary different mechanisms.

435
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:11,510
Diffusion, which is
caused by variations

436
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:14,150
in the concentration.

437
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:18,000
And drifts of particles
in an electric field.

438
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,530
So when you put
an electric field,

439
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:22,490
so if you take a beaker
filled with salt solution,

440
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:25,490
you put two metal
electrodes in it,

441
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:27,170
you produce an
electric field that

442
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:30,380
causes these ions to drift in--

443
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,533
and that's another
source of current

444
00:23:32,533 --> 00:23:33,950
that we're going
to look at today.

445
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:41,030
So here are our learning
objectives for today.

446
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:44,350
We're going to understand how
the timescales of diffusion

447
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,420
relate to the length scales.

448
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,040
That's a really
interesting story.

449
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,710
That's very important.

450
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:53,700
We're going to understand how
concentration gradients lead

451
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,630
to currents.

452
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:57,680
That's known as
Fick's First Law.

453
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,700
And we're going to
understand how charges drift

454
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:05,120
in an electric field in a
way that leads to current,

455
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,850
and the mathematical
relation that

456
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,760
describes voltage differences.

457
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,660
And this is called
Ohm's Law in the brain.

458
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,388
And we're going to learn about
the concept of resistivity.

459
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:21,860
So the first thing we
need to talk about,

460
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:25,380
if we're going to talk about
diffusion, is thermal energy.

461
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,880
So every particle
in the world is

462
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:35,350
being jostled by other particles
that are crashing into it.

463
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:38,740
And at thermal equilibrium,
every degree of freedom,

464
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:42,160
every way that a particle
can move, either forward

465
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:46,300
and backward, left and right,
up and down, or rotations,

466
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,980
this way or this way,
or whichever way,

467
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:54,610
I didn't show yet,
come to equilibrium

468
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:58,870
at a particular energy that's
proportional to temperature.

469
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:01,570
In other words, if
a particle is moving

470
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:03,640
in this direction
in equilibrium,

471
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:08,740
it will have a kinetic energy
in that direction that's

472
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,160
proportional to the temperature.

473
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,270
And that temperature
is in units of kelvin

474
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,040
relative to absolute zero.

475
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:19,550
And the proportionality constant
is the Boltzmann constant,

476
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:24,020
which has units of
joules per kelvin.

477
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:27,610
So when you multiply the
Boltzmann constant k times

478
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:30,910
temperature, what you find is
that every degree of freedom

479
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:33,550
will come to equilibrium
at 4 times 10

480
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:39,910
to the minus 21 joules,
which is an amount of energy,

481
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:42,310
at room temperature.

482
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:46,120
At zero temperature, you can
see that every degree of freedom

483
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,320
has zero energy.

484
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,550
And so nothing is moving.

485
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:52,390
Nothing's rotating, nothing's
moving any direction.

486
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:53,680
Everything's perfectly still.

487
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:01,670
So let's calculate
how fast particles

488
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:04,820
move at thermal equilibrium
in room temperature.

489
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:11,660
So you may remember from
your first physics class

490
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,550
that the kinetic
energy of a particle

491
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:17,640
is proportional to the velocity
squared, 1/2 mv squared.

492
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,990
So the average velocity
squared of a particle

493
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:27,610
at thermal equilibrium is just
1/2 times that much energy.

494
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:29,090
That makes sense?

495
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:34,430
Now we [AUDIO OUT] how
fast a particle is moving--

496
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:38,680
for example, a sodium ion.

497
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,980
So you can see that the average
velocity squared is just

498
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,150
kT over m.

499
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:45,890
We just divide both sides by m.

500
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:48,200
So the average velocity
squared is kT over m.

501
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,360
The mass of a
sodium ion is this.

502
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,490
So the average
velocity squared is

503
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:54,980
10 to the 5 meter squared
per second squared.

504
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,690
Just take the square
root that, and you

505
00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:01,230
get the average velocity
is 320 meters per second.

506
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:05,150
So that means that the
air molecules, which

507
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:08,840
have a similar
mass to sodium ion,

508
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,790
are whizzing around at
300 meters per second.

509
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:17,955
So that would cross this room
in a few hundredths of a second.

510
00:27:17,955 --> 00:27:19,580
But of course, that's
not what happens.

511
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:25,550
Particles don't just go whizzing
along at 300 meters per second.

512
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:28,705
What happens to them?

513
00:27:28,705 --> 00:27:30,410
AUDIENCE: Bump into each other.

514
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:31,618
MICHALE FEE: Into each other.

515
00:27:31,618 --> 00:27:35,520
They're all crashing into
each other constantly.

516
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:40,440
So in solution, a particle
collides with a water molecule

517
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,910
every about 10 to the
13 times per second.

518
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:47,850
10 to the minus 13 seconds
between collisions.

519
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:50,750
So that means the particle is
moving a little bit crashing,

520
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,500
moving in a different
direction, crashing,

521
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,410
moving in a different
direction and crashing.

522
00:27:55,410 --> 00:28:01,200
So if you follow one particle,
it's just jumping around,

523
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,403
it's diffusing.

524
00:28:02,403 --> 00:28:03,570
So what does that look like?

525
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:08,260
Daniel made a little
video that shows to scale.

526
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,650
This is position in micron.

527
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:13,000
And time is in real-time.

528
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,280
So this video shows in real-time
what the motion of a particle

529
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,060
might look like.

530
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:27,750
In each point, it's moving,
colliding, and moving off

531
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:30,050
in some random direction.

532
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:37,840
You can actually see this.

533
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,670
If you look at a
very small particle--

534
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:45,480
who was it, Daniel, who did that
experiment looking at pollen?

535
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,592
It's Brownian, at Brown.

536
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:47,175
AUDIENCE: Yup.

537
00:28:47,175 --> 00:28:49,590
MICHALE FEE: What
was his first name?

538
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,790
Brown.

539
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:51,720
Brownian motion.

540
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,620
Have you heard of
Brownian motion?

541
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:56,070
So somebody named
Brown was looking

542
00:28:56,070 --> 00:29:02,010
at pollen particles in water and
noticing that they jump around,

543
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:04,820
just like this.

544
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,790
And he hypothesized that they
were being jostled around

545
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:08,450
by the water.

546
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,720
Any questions?

547
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:22,370
So what can we say about this?

548
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:25,840
There's something really
interesting about diffusion

549
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,480
that's very
non-intuitive at first.

550
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,250
Diffusion has some really
strange aspect to it.

551
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:36,950
That a distance that
a particle can diffuse

552
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:41,390
depends very much on
the time that you allow.

553
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:43,850
And it's not just
a simple relation.

554
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:46,200
So let's just look at this.

555
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,200
So let's ask how
much time does it

556
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,860
take for an ion to
diffuse a short distance,

557
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:57,320
like across the
soma of a neuron.

558
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,150
So an ion can diffuse
across the soma of a neuron

559
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,560
in about a 20th of a second.

560
00:30:07,548 --> 00:30:08,840
How about down it at dendrites.

561
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,960
So let's start our
ion in the cell body.

562
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,640
And ask, how long
does it take an iron

563
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,980
to reach the end of a dendrite
that can be about a millimeter

564
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:18,480
away.

565
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:25,610
Can take about 10
minutes on average.

566
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:27,350
That's how long it
will take an iron

567
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,540
to get that far away
from its starting point.

568
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,880
So you can see, 20th
of a second here.

569
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:41,250
And here it's like 500 seconds.

570
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:43,050
About 10 minutes.

571
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:45,390
How long does it take an ion,
starting at the cell body,

572
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:47,392
to diffuse all the way down--

573
00:30:47,392 --> 00:30:49,350
so you know there are
neurons in your body that

574
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:54,110
start in your spinal cord and go
all the way down to your feet.

575
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:59,030
So motor neurons in your spinal
cord can have very long axons.

576
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:03,590
So how long does it take
an ion to get from the soma

577
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:07,400
all the way down to the end
of an axon, a long axon?

578
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:16,960
Somebody just take a guess.

579
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,840
It's 20th of a second
here, 10 minutes here.

580
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:25,010
Anybody want to guess?

581
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:27,170
An hour, yup.

582
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:29,180
10 years.

583
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,560
OK.

584
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,310
Why is that?

585
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:33,595
That's crazy, right?

586
00:31:33,595 --> 00:31:34,470
How is that possible?

587
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,860
And that's an ion.

588
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:40,320
So a cell body is making
proteins and all kinds of stuff

589
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,930
that have to get down
to build synapses

590
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,760
at the other end of that axon.

591
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:49,350
And proteins diffuse a heck
of a lot slower than ions do.

592
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:54,480
So basically a cell body
could make stuff for the axon,

593
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,430
and it would never get there
in your entire lifetime.

594
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:02,730
And that's why cells have to
actually make little trains.

595
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:04,260
They literally
make little trains.

596
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,490
They package up stuff
and put it on the train

597
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:12,070
and it just marches down the
axon until it gets to the end.

598
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:15,250
And this is the reason why.

599
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:18,070
So what we're going to do is
I'm going to just walk you

600
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:21,590
through a very simple
derivation of why this is true

601
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:24,790
and how to think about this.

602
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:27,250
So here's what
we're going to do.

603
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:30,580
So normally things diffuse
in three dimensions, right?

604
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,870
But it's just much harder
to analyze things in three

605
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:33,370
dimensions..

606
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:36,430
So you can get basically
the right answer

607
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:39,520
just by analyzing how things
diffuse in one dimension.

608
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,950
So Daniel made this
little video to show you

609
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:43,160
what this looks like.

610
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:47,968
This is I think 100 particles
all lined up near zero.

611
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:49,510
And we're going to
turn on the video.

612
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:52,300
We're going to let them all
start diffusing at one moment.

613
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,037
So you can just watch
what happens to all

614
00:32:54,037 --> 00:32:55,120
these different particles.

615
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,380
So you can see that
some particles end up

616
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,550
over here on the left.

617
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:05,230
Other particles end up
over here on the right.

618
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:08,790
You can see that the
distribution of particles

619
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:11,490
spreads out.

620
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:16,740
And so we're going to figure out
why that is, why that happens.

621
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,490
So the first thing I
just want to tell you

622
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:21,430
is that the distribution
of particles,

623
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:24,880
if they all start at
zero, and they diffuse

624
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,870
in 1D away from zero, the
distribution that you get

625
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,500
is Gaussian.

626
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:34,720
And the basic reason is that,
let's start at the center,

627
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,210
and on every time step they
have a probability of 1/2

628
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:41,560
of going to the right and
1/2 of going to the left.

629
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:45,760
And so basically there
are many more combinations

630
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,330
of ways a particle can do
some lefts and do some rights

631
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:51,250
and end up back
where it started.

632
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:53,290
It's very unlikely
that the particle

633
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:57,670
will do a whole bunch of
going right all in a row.

634
00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:01,780
And so that's why the
density and the distribution

635
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,995
is very low down here.

636
00:34:03,995 --> 00:34:05,620
And so you end up
with something that's

637
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,735
just a Gaussian distribution.

638
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:15,790
So let's analyze this
in a little more detail.

639
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:19,469
So we're going to just make a
very simple model of particles

640
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:21,434
stepping to the
right or to the left.

641
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,100
We're going to consider
a particle that

642
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:33,790
is moving left or right at a
fixed velocity vx for some time

643
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:35,580
tau before a collision.

644
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,830
And we're going to imagine
that each time the particle

645
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:41,250
collides it resets its velocity
randomly, either to the left

646
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,280
or to the right.

647
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,489
So on every time step,
half the particles

648
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:49,500
will step right by
a distance delta,

649
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,699
which is the velocity
times the time tau.

650
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:54,260
And the other half
of the particles

651
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:57,500
will step left by
that same distance.

652
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,440
So they're going either to
the left or to the right

653
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,460
by a distance delta.

654
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,820
So if we start with n
particles and all of them

655
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:17,660
start at position
0 at time 0, then

656
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:23,060
we can write down the position
of every particle at time step

657
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:27,480
n, the i-th particle
at time step n.

658
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,270
And we're going to assume that
each particle is independent,

659
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:34,760
each doing their own
thing, ignoring each other.

660
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:38,560
So now you can see
that you can write down

661
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,850
the position of the particle
at time step n is just

662
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:45,490
the position of the particle
at the previous time

663
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:48,420
step, plus or minus
this little delta.

664
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:52,740
Any questions about that?

665
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:03,250
So please, if you ever just
haven't followed one step

666
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:05,390
that I do, just let me know.

667
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,030
I'm happy to explain it again.

668
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:11,170
I often am watching somebody
explaining something really

669
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:14,440
simple, and my brain is
just in some funny state

670
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,660
and I just don't get it.

671
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:21,020
So it's totally fine if you want
me to explain something again.

672
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:23,020
You don't have to be
embarrassed because happens

673
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:23,830
to me all the time.

674
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,460
So now what we can do
is use this expression,

675
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:33,700
compute how that distribution
evolves over time,

676
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:39,070
how that distribution of
particles, this i-th particle

677
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:42,340
over time, time step n.

678
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,650
All right, so let's calculate
what the average position

679
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:46,060
of the ensemble is.

680
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:48,320
So these brackets mean average.

681
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,490
So the bracket with an
i, that I'm averaging

682
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:55,525
this quantity over i particles.

683
00:36:55,525 --> 00:37:00,130
And so it's just
the sum of positions

684
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:02,800
for every particle, divided
by the number of particles.

685
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,910
That's the average position.

686
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:08,590
So again, the position of the
i-th particle at time step n

687
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:11,570
is just the position of that
particle at the previous time

688
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:12,940
step, plus or minus delta.

689
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:16,480
We just plug that into
there, into there.

690
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,320
And now we calculate the sum.

691
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,640
But we have two terms.

692
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,980
We have this term and that term.

693
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:23,480
Let's break them up
into two separate sums.

694
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:27,880
So this is equal to the sum
over the previous positions,

695
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:33,310
plus the sum over how
much the change was

696
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:35,020
from one time step to the next.

697
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,400
Does that makes sense?

698
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,040
But what is this sum?

699
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,800
We're summing over
all the particles,

700
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,770
how much they changed from
the previous time step

701
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:46,780
to this time step.

702
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:49,200
Well, half of them moved to
the right and half of them

703
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,050
the left.

704
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:54,260
So that sum is just zero.

705
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:59,210
So you can see that
the average position

706
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,220
of the particles
at this time step

707
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:04,550
is just equal to the average
position of the particles

708
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:05,840
at the previous time step.

709
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,690
And what that means is that
the center of the distribution

710
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:11,840
hasn't changed.

711
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:15,800
If you start all the particles
at zero, they diffuse around.

712
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,970
The average position
is still zero.

713
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:19,650
Yes?

714
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:22,555
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
bracket [INAUDIBLE]..

715
00:38:22,555 --> 00:38:23,500
MICHALE FEE: Yes.

716
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:30,650
So this here is just this.

717
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:35,480
So this bracket means I'm
averaging over this quantity i.

718
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,230
So you can see that's
what I'm doing here.

719
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:40,712
I'm summing over i and dividing
by the number of particles.

720
00:38:40,712 --> 00:38:41,712
AUDIENCE: And what is i?

721
00:38:41,712 --> 00:38:44,270
MICHALE FEE: I is
the particle number.

722
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:48,920
So if we have 10 particles,
i goes from 1 to 10.

723
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,420
Thank you.

724
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,970
So that's a little boring.

725
00:38:56,970 --> 00:39:00,030
But we used a trick
here that we're

726
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:02,040
going to use now to
actually calculate

727
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:05,640
the interesting thing, which
is on average how far do

728
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:09,950
the particles get from
where they started.

729
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:13,070
So what we're going to do is not
calculate the average position

730
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:15,350
of all the particles.

731
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:19,610
We're going to calculate
the average absolute value

732
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:21,155
from where they started.

733
00:39:21,155 --> 00:39:22,800
Does that makes sense?

734
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:27,132
We're going to ask, on average,
how far did they get from where

735
00:39:27,132 --> 00:39:28,340
they started, which was zero.

736
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:37,180
So absolute values,
nobody likes.

737
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,390
They're hard to deal with.

738
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:43,580
But this is exactly the same
as calculating the square root

739
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:46,590
of the average square.

740
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:50,942
It's the same as
calculating the variance.

741
00:39:50,942 --> 00:39:52,493
Does that makes sense?

742
00:39:52,493 --> 00:39:53,910
So what we're going
to do is we're

743
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:57,380
going to calculate the
variance of that distribution.

744
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,890
And the square root
of that variance

745
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:02,670
is just the standard deviation,
which is just how wide it is,

746
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:07,500
which is just how far on
average the particles got

747
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,402
from where they started.

748
00:40:09,402 --> 00:40:11,490
Does that makes sense?

749
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:13,930
So let's push on.

750
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:17,412
We're going to calculate
the average square distance.

751
00:40:17,412 --> 00:40:19,870
Now we're just going to take
the square of that at the end.

752
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:23,890
So the average of the
position squared, we're

753
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:26,740
going to plug this into here.

754
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,190
So we're going to square it.

755
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:31,240
So the position of
the particle squared

756
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,230
is just this quantity squared.

757
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,450
Let's factor it out.

758
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:38,530
So we have this term
squared plus twice

759
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:43,720
that times that here,
plus that term squared.

760
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:47,450
And we're going to
now plug that average.

761
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:50,620
So the average position
squared is just the average.

762
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:56,230
The average position
squared at this time step n

763
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:59,200
is the average position
squared at the previous time

764
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,940
step plus some other stuff.

765
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:05,190
And let's take a look at
what that other stuff is.

766
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,400
What is this?

767
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,180
This is plus or
minus 2 times delta,

768
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:15,060
which is the step it takes,
the size of the step times x.

769
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:18,520
So what is that average?

770
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,660
Half of these are positive and
half of these are negative.

771
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:24,630
So the average is zero.

772
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:27,450
And quantity is the
average of delta squared.

773
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:33,570
Well, delta squared is
always positive, right?

774
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,580
So what does this say?

775
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:43,050
What this says is that the
variance at this time step

776
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:45,680
is just the variance
at a previous time step

777
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,410
is a constant.

778
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:49,260
So let's analyze that.

779
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,660
What this says is that
at each time step,

780
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:56,950
the variance grows
by some constant.

781
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:58,090
Delta is a distance.

782
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:02,660
Delta squared is just the units
of variance of a distribution

783
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,910
that's a function of distance.

784
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:10,010
So if the variance
at time step 0 is 0,

785
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:12,560
that means they're all
lined up at the origin.

786
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,660
One time step later, the
variance will be delta squared.

787
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,730
The next time step, it
will be two delta squared.

788
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:20,180
The next time step,
dot, dot, dot.

789
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:23,540
Up at some time step n, it
will be n times delta squared.

790
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,860
So you see what's happening?

791
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,720
The variance of
this distribution

792
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,665
is growing linearly.

793
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:38,870
We can change from time
steps to continuous time.

794
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:45,190
So the step number
is just time divided

795
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:48,880
by tau, which is
some interval in time

796
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,930
like the interval
between collisions.

797
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:54,790
And so you can see that
the variance is just

798
00:42:54,790 --> 00:43:01,120
growing linearly in time where
the variance is just 2 times d

799
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:06,070
times T, where d is what we
call the diffusion coefficient.

800
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:09,010
It's just length
squared divided by time.

801
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,030
Why is that?

802
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:20,155
Because as time grows, the
variance grows linearly.

803
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:28,180
So if we want to take
time, multiply it

804
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:30,430
by something that
gives us variance,

805
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:35,600
it has to be variance
per unit time.

806
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,090
And variance, for
something that's

807
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:42,760
a distribution of position,
has to have position squared.

808
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:43,260
Yes?

809
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:46,324
AUDIENCE: But do we like
[INAUDIBLE],, like that?

810
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:51,400
MICHALE FEE: It's built
into the definition

811
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,460
of the diffusion constant, OK?

812
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,490
Any questions about that?

813
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:10,380
And now here here's the answer.

814
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:13,170
So the variance is
growing linearly in time.

815
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:17,540
What that means is that
the standard deviation,

816
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:20,450
the average distance
from the starting point,

817
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:23,140
is growing as the
square root of time.

818
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:28,050
And that's key.

819
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:29,430
That I want you to remember.

820
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:40,930
The distance that
a particle diffuses

821
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:43,930
from its starting
point on average grows

822
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:45,210
is the square root of time.

823
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:56,590
So for a small molecule,
a typical small molecule,

824
00:44:56,590 --> 00:45:00,490
the diffusion constant is 10 to
the minus 5 centimeters squared

825
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:02,650
per second.

826
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:07,140
And so now we can just plug
in some distances in times

827
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:12,480
and see how long it
takes this particle

828
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,850
to diffuse some distance.

829
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:15,870
So let's do that.

830
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:18,510
Let's plug in a
length of 10 microns.

831
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:20,730
That was our soma,
our cell body.

832
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:23,430
It's 10 to the
minus 3 centimeters.

833
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:27,980
Time is that squared,
length squared.

834
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:30,490
So it's 10 to the minus 6
centimeters squared divided

835
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:32,410
by the diffusion constant.

836
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:35,708
2 times the diffusion constant,
2 times 10 to the minus 5

837
00:45:35,708 --> 00:45:37,000
centimeters squared per second.

838
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,010
You can see centimeter
squareds cancel.

839
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:41,160
That leaves us time.

840
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,450
50 milliseconds.

841
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:47,000
Now let's put in one millimeter.

842
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,240
That was the length
of our dendrite.

843
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,570
So that's 10 to the
minus 1 centimeter.

844
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:56,670
So we plug that into
our equation for time.

845
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,790
Time is just L squared--

846
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:02,670
I forgot to actually
write that down.

847
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:04,395
Here's the equation
that I'm solving.

848
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,720
So what this equation at
the bottom here is saying

849
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:18,760
is some distance is equal
to the square root of 2dT.

850
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:22,600
And I'm just saying L
squared is equal to 2 dT.

851
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:28,000
And I'm solving for
T, L squared over 2d.

852
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,920
That's the equation I'm solving.

853
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,795
I'm giving you a length and I'm
calculating how long it takes.

854
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:42,690
So if you put in 10
to the minus 1 here,

855
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:44,900
you get 10 to the minus
2 divided by 2 times 10

856
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:49,910
to the minus 500 seconds,
which is about 10 minutes.

857
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:54,610
And now if you ask how long
does it take to go a meter,

858
00:46:54,610 --> 00:46:56,840
that's 10 to the 2 centimeters.

859
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:00,180
That's 10 to the 4 divided
by 10 to the minus 5.

860
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:02,930
Somebody over here
figured it out right away.

861
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:09,160
About 5 times 10
to the 8 seconds,

862
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,200
which is about 10 years.

863
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:13,320
A year is pi times 10 to
the 7 seconds, by the way.

864
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,020
Plus or minus a few percent.

865
00:47:25,296 --> 00:47:26,550
Any questions about that?

866
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,730
Cool, right?

867
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:39,590
So neurons and cells
and biology has

868
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:45,130
to go to extraordinary lengths
to overcome this craziness

869
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:53,820
of diffusion, which explains
a lot of the structure you

870
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:54,600
see in cells.

871
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:08,570
So you can see that
diffusion causes

872
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:12,380
the movement of ions
from places where

873
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:15,170
they're concentrated to places
where there aren't so many

874
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:15,950
ions.

875
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:19,580
So let's take a little
bit slightly more

876
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:21,345
detail look at that idea.

877
00:48:21,345 --> 00:48:22,970
So what I'm going to
tell you about now

878
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:24,830
is called Fick's First Law.

879
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:26,810
And the idea is that
diffusion produces

880
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:30,530
a net flow of particles from
regions of high concentration

881
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:34,010
to regions of lower
concentration.

882
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:36,260
And the flux of
particles is proportional

883
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:38,120
to the concentration gradient.

884
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:40,070
Now this is just
really obvious, right?

885
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:45,770
If you have a box, and on the
left side of the box you have n

886
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:46,370
particles.

887
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:48,830
Then on the right
side of the box then

888
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:51,643
you're going to have particles
diffusing from here to there.

889
00:48:51,643 --> 00:48:53,060
And you're going
to have particles

890
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:55,190
diffusing from there to there.

891
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:57,300
But because there are
more of them over here,

892
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:00,250
they're just going to be
more particles going this way

893
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:02,756
than there are that way.

894
00:49:02,756 --> 00:49:03,910
Does that makes sense?

895
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:10,080
Let's say each
particle here might

896
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:13,530
have a 50% chance of
diffusing here or staying here

897
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:15,600
or diffusing somewhere else.

898
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:18,047
Particles here also
equally have probability

899
00:49:18,047 --> 00:49:18,880
of going either way.

900
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,280
But just because there
are more of them here,

901
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:25,710
there's going to be more
particles going that way.

902
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:27,780
You can just
calculate the number

903
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:30,690
of particles going this way
minus the number of particles

904
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:33,270
going that way.

905
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:34,680
And that gives
you the net number

906
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,930
of particles going to the right.

907
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:40,920
But what does that look like?

908
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:47,760
You have the number here minus
the number some distance away.

909
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,047
And what if you were to
divide that by the distance?

910
00:49:51,047 --> 00:49:52,130
What would that look like?

911
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:55,420
Good.

912
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:56,980
It looks like a derivative.

913
00:49:56,980 --> 00:50:00,320
So if you calculate
the flux, it's

914
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,390
minus the diffusion
constant times

915
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:05,750
1 over delta, the separation
between these boxes.

916
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:09,140
It's the concentration here
minus the concentration there.

917
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:11,920
And that is just a derivative.

918
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:15,050
And that's Fick's First Law.

919
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:18,290
I have a few slides at the
end of the lecture that

920
00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:21,540
do this derivation
more completely.

921
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:25,280
So please take a look at
that if you have time.

922
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:31,660
So now this is really
an important concept.

923
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:36,430
This Fick's First Law, the fact
that concentration gradients

924
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:40,720
produce a flow of
ions, of particles,

925
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:44,840
is so fundamental
to how neurons work.

926
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,640
And here we're
going to be building

927
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:50,410
that up over the course of
the next couple lectures.

928
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:52,230
So imagine that you
have a cell that

929
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:56,160
has a lot of potassium
ions inside and very

930
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,720
few potassium ions outside.

931
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,100
Now you can see
that you're going

932
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:03,035
to have potassium ions
diffusing from here.

933
00:51:03,035 --> 00:51:04,410
Sorry, and I forgot
to say, let's

934
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:07,710
say that your cell
has a hole in it.

935
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:10,710
So you're going to have
potassium ions diffusing

936
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:13,830
from inside to outside
through the hole.

937
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:16,200
You also have some
potassium ions out here.

938
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:19,030
And some of those
might diffuse in.

939
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:21,360
But there are just so
many more potassium ions

940
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:24,480
inside than outside
concentration-wise

941
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,760
that the probability of one
going out through the hole

942
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,760
is just much higher than the
probability of a potassium ion

943
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,410
going back into the cell.

944
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:39,510
So here I'm just zooming
in on that channel,

945
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:41,400
on that pore through
the membrane.

946
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:44,160
Lots of potassium ions here.

947
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:47,610
On average, there's going to
be a net flow of potassium

948
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:50,610
out through that hole.

949
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:54,172
And we can plot the
concentration gradient

950
00:51:54,172 --> 00:51:54,880
through the hole.

951
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,490
And you can see it's
high here, it decreases,

952
00:51:57,490 --> 00:52:00,670
and it's low outside.

953
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:05,160
And so there's a net flow that's
proportional to the steepness

954
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:09,220
of concentration profile.

955
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:11,850
So that's true,
you get a net flow,

956
00:52:11,850 --> 00:52:14,770
even if each particle is
diffusing independently.

957
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:18,590
They don't know anything
about each other.

958
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:21,695
And yet that concentration
gradient produces a current.

959
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,030
All concentration
gradients go away.

960
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:31,360
Why is that?

961
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:34,330
Because calcium ions will flow
from the inside of the cell

962
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:37,810
to the outside of the cell until
they're the same concentration.

963
00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:39,790
And then you'll
have just as many

964
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:43,570
flowing back inside as
you have flowing outside.

965
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:44,290
Why?

966
00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:46,810
So eventually that would
happen to all of our cells.

967
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:47,810
Why doesn't that happen?

968
00:52:52,067 --> 00:52:54,432
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
because they're alive.

969
00:52:54,432 --> 00:52:57,070
MICHALE FEE: Well, that's
exactly the right answer,

970
00:52:57,070 --> 00:53:01,440
but there are a few
intermediate steps.

971
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,470
If you were to not
be alive anymore,

972
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:06,390
the potassium ions
would just diffuse out.

973
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:08,520
And that would be the end.

974
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:12,360
But what happens is
there are other proteins

975
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:14,970
in the membrane that take
those potassium ions from here

976
00:53:14,970 --> 00:53:17,940
and pump them back inside and
maintain the concentration

977
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:18,660
gradient.

978
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:20,100
But that costs energy.

979
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:22,260
Those proteins use ATP.

980
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:24,240
And that ATP comes from eating.

981
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:32,850
But eventually all
concentration gradients go away.

982
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:43,420
So that is how we
get current flow

983
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:45,460
from concentration gradients.

984
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:52,590
Now the next topic has to do
with the diffusion of ions

985
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:57,340
in the presence of
voltage differences,

986
00:53:57,340 --> 00:54:00,800
in the presence of
voltage gradients.

987
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,790
The bottom line here
that I want you to know,

988
00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:07,330
that I want you to understand,
is that current flow in neurons

989
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:08,640
obeys Ohm's Law.

990
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,650
Now what does that mean?

991
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:12,290
Let's imagine that
we have a resistor.

992
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:17,380
Let's say across a membrane
or in the intracellular

993
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:21,790
or extracellular
space of a neuron.

994
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:26,230
The current flow through
that resistive medium

995
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:31,780
is proportional to the
voltage difference.

996
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:33,250
So that's Ohm's Law.

997
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:38,080
The current is proportional
to the voltage difference

998
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:41,020
across the two terminals, the
two sides of the resistor.

999
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:44,290
And the proportionality constant
is 1 over the resistance.

1000
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:50,680
So here current has
units of amperes.

1001
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:55,750
The voltage difference
is units of volts.

1002
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:59,600
And the resistance
has units of ohms.

1003
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:00,650
Any questions about that?

1004
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:08,240
So let's go through--

1005
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,160
let's develop this
idea a little bit more

1006
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:15,350
and understand why it is that
a voltage difference produces

1007
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:18,470
a current that's
proportional to voltage.

1008
00:55:18,470 --> 00:55:20,220
So let's go back to
our little [AUDIO OUT]

1009
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:21,800
filled with salt solution.

1010
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:24,800
There are ions in here
dissolved in the water.

1011
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,060
We have two metal plates.

1012
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:28,760
We've put a battery between
the two metal plates that

1013
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:31,580
holds those two plates at
some fixed voltage difference

1014
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:39,780
delta v. And we're going
to ask what happens.

1015
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:41,050
So let's zoom in here.

1016
00:55:41,050 --> 00:55:43,070
There is one plate
that's at one potential.

1017
00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:45,500
There's another plate
at another potential.

1018
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,420
There's some voltage
difference between those

1019
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:52,940
that's delta v. The two plates
are separated by a distance L.

1020
00:55:52,940 --> 00:56:02,660
And that voltage difference
produces an electric field

1021
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:06,530
that points from the
high voltage region

1022
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:07,800
to the low voltage region.

1023
00:56:10,970 --> 00:56:14,390
So an electric field produces
a force on a charge--

1024
00:56:14,390 --> 00:56:16,670
we have lots of
charges in here--

1025
00:56:16,670 --> 00:56:22,700
that's proportional to the
charge and the electric field.

1026
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:24,260
So what is that
force going to do?

1027
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:29,600
That force is just going
to drag that particle

1028
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,770
through the liquid,
through the water.

1029
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:39,520
So why is it?

1030
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:44,100
So if this were a vacuum in
here and we put a charge there

1031
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:47,190
and metal plates and we
put a battery across,

1032
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:48,540
what would that particle do?

1033
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:53,580
It would move.

1034
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:56,080
But what would this force
do to that particle?

1035
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,880
AUDIENCE: [INTERPOSING VOICES]

1036
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:58,780
MICHALE FEE: Exactly.

1037
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:00,910
So what would the velocity do?

1038
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:01,780
AUDIENCE: Increase.

1039
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:03,230
MICHALE FEE: It would
just increase linearly.

1040
00:57:03,230 --> 00:57:04,920
So the particle
would start moving.

1041
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,930
And it would start moving
slowly and it'd go--

1042
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:09,585
poof-- crash into the plate.

1043
00:57:09,585 --> 00:57:10,960
But that's not
what happens here.

1044
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,358
Why is that?

1045
00:57:13,358 --> 00:57:14,774
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1046
00:57:14,774 --> 00:57:17,190
MICHALE FEE: Because
there's stuff in the way.

1047
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:22,540
And so it accelerates, and it
gets hit by a water molecule.

1048
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:24,770
And it gets pushed
off in some direction.

1049
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:29,110
And then it accelerates in
this direction, gets hit again.

1050
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:32,680
But it's constantly being
accelerated in one direction

1051
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,855
before it collides.

1052
00:57:34,855 --> 00:57:35,980
And so here's what happens.

1053
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:48,970
So it's diffusing around.

1054
00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:52,600
But on each step, it has a
little bit of acceleration

1055
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,610
in this direction,
in the direction

1056
00:57:54,610 --> 00:57:55,540
of the electric field.

1057
00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:07,360
And so you can show using
the same kind of analysis

1058
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:12,940
that we used in calculating
the distribution, the change

1059
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:15,520
in mean and variance,
you can show

1060
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:20,200
that mean of a
distribution of particles

1061
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:24,000
that starts at zero shifts--

1062
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,670
of positive particles
shifts in the electric field

1063
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:31,220
linearly in time.

1064
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:35,150
And you can just think about
that as the electric field

1065
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:38,300
reaches in, grabs that
charged particle, and pulls it

1066
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:41,780
in this direction
against viscous drag.

1067
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:46,370
So now a force produces
a constant velocity, not

1068
00:58:46,370 --> 00:58:49,160
acceleration.

1069
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:51,440
And that velocity is
called the drift velocity.

1070
00:58:54,330 --> 00:59:01,190
So the force is proportional
to drift velocity.

1071
00:59:01,190 --> 00:59:03,630
What is that little f there?

1072
00:59:03,630 --> 00:59:04,720
Anybody know what that is?

1073
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,095
AUDIENCE: Frictional
coefficient.

1074
00:59:06,095 --> 00:59:08,600
MICHALE FEE: It's
the coefficient

1075
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,580
of friction of that particle.

1076
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:14,900
And Einstein cleverly
noticed that the coefficient

1077
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:20,390
of friction of a particle
being dragged through a liquid

1078
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:21,735
is related to what?

1079
00:59:21,735 --> 00:59:22,235
Any guess?

1080
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:29,900
Diffusion coefficient
of that particle.

1081
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:30,525
Is that cool?

1082
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:32,260
That just gives me chills.

1083
00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:38,770
The frictional
coefficient is just

1084
00:59:38,770 --> 00:59:41,750
kT over the diffusion constant.

1085
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:44,320
So if you actually just go
through that same analysis

1086
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:48,160
of calculating the mean of the
distribution, what you find

1087
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:52,450
is that v moves
linearly in time.

1088
00:59:52,450 --> 00:59:54,130
But it's also very intuitive.

1089
00:59:54,130 --> 01:00:01,000
If you're in a swimming pool,
you put your hand in the water,

1090
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:05,180
and you push your hand
with a constant force.

1091
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:05,840
What happens?

1092
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,590
Well, let me flip it around.

1093
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:10,790
You move your hand through the
water at a constant velocity.

1094
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:14,620
What is the force feel like?

1095
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:16,197
The force is constant, right?

1096
01:00:16,197 --> 01:00:17,530
So flip it the other way around.

1097
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:19,072
If the force is
constant, then you're

1098
01:00:19,072 --> 01:00:20,840
going to get a
constant velocity.

1099
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:24,120
Yes?

1100
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,430
AUDIENCE: So side
question, but you can also

1101
01:00:26,430 --> 01:00:28,555
look at that like a
terminal velocity problem?

1102
01:00:28,555 --> 01:00:29,430
MICHALE FEE: Exactly.

1103
01:00:29,430 --> 01:00:30,660
It's exactly the same thing.

1104
01:00:34,210 --> 01:00:39,250
So the drift velocity is
proportional to the force

1105
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:43,420
by proportionality constant,
1 over the coefficient

1106
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:46,270
of friction, which
is now d over kT.

1107
01:00:46,270 --> 01:00:49,180
And what is this
force proportional to?

1108
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:50,530
Anybody remember?

1109
01:00:50,530 --> 01:00:54,695
The force was proportional
to the electric field.

1110
01:00:59,050 --> 01:01:03,590
And so let's
calculate the current.

1111
01:01:03,590 --> 01:01:06,280
So I'm going to argue
that the current is

1112
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:10,950
proportional to the drift
velocity times the area.

1113
01:01:10,950 --> 01:01:12,770
Now why is that?

1114
01:01:12,770 --> 01:01:15,410
So if I have an
electric field, it

1115
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:18,980
makes these particles, all
the particles in this area

1116
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:24,250
here drift at a constant
velocity in this direction.

1117
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:25,900
So there is a certain
amount of current

1118
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:29,706
that's flowing in
this area right here.

1119
01:01:29,706 --> 01:01:31,700
Does that makes sense?

1120
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:35,690
Now if my electrodes are big
and I also have electric field

1121
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:38,360
up here, then that
electric field

1122
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:42,067
is causing current
to flow up here too.

1123
01:01:42,067 --> 01:01:43,650
And if there's
electric field up here,

1124
01:01:43,650 --> 01:01:45,780
then there will be current
flowing up here too.

1125
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:48,570
And so you can see that the
amount of current that's

1126
01:01:48,570 --> 01:01:51,720
flowing between the electrodes
is proportional to the drift

1127
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:57,120
velocity and the cross-sectional
area between the two

1128
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:58,520
electrodes.

1129
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:00,130
Yes?

1130
01:02:00,130 --> 01:02:01,370
So that's really important.

1131
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:10,410
Now we figured out
that the drift velocity

1132
01:02:10,410 --> 01:02:13,500
is proportional to
the electric field.

1133
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:16,440
So the current is proportional
to the electric field

1134
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:17,910
times the area.

1135
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:21,030
And the electric field is
just the voltage difference

1136
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:25,890
divided by the spacing
between the electrodes.

1137
01:02:25,890 --> 01:02:27,870
And so the current is
proportional to voltage

1138
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:30,750
times area divided by length.

1139
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:32,090
So we have a proportionality.

1140
01:02:32,090 --> 01:02:34,490
Current is
proportional to voltage

1141
01:02:34,490 --> 01:02:36,420
times area divided by length.

1142
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:39,980
And now let's plug in what that
proportionality constant is.

1143
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,350
This is now like
Ohm's Law, right?

1144
01:02:49,350 --> 01:02:51,630
We're saying the current
is proportional to voltage

1145
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:53,170
difference.

1146
01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:55,600
The thing that the
proportionality constant

1147
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,750
here is something
called resistivity.

1148
01:02:57,750 --> 01:02:59,860
Otherwise known as conductivity.

1149
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:02,583
But we're going to
use resistivity.

1150
01:03:05,690 --> 01:03:07,490
So this is just Ohm's Law.

1151
01:03:07,490 --> 01:03:13,230
It says current is proportional
to voltage difference.

1152
01:03:13,230 --> 01:03:15,210
Let's rewrite that a
little bit so that it

1153
01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:16,680
looks more like Ohm's Law.

1154
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:20,010
Current is proportional
to voltage difference.

1155
01:03:20,010 --> 01:03:23,580
And that thing, that
thingy right there,

1156
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:25,770
should have units of what?

1157
01:03:25,770 --> 01:03:27,510
1 over ohms.

1158
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:28,820
Right?

1159
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:30,980
So that is 1 over resistance.

1160
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:34,670
Let's just write down
what the resistance is.

1161
01:03:34,670 --> 01:03:39,660
Resistance is just resistivity
times length divided by area.

1162
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:42,290
So let's just stop
and take a breath

1163
01:03:42,290 --> 01:03:45,230
and think about why
this makes sense.

1164
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:51,100
Resistance is how
much resistance there

1165
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:53,630
is to flow at a
given voltage, right?

1166
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:58,130
So what happens if we
make ours really small?

1167
01:03:58,130 --> 01:04:01,130
What happens to the resistance?

1168
01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:03,130
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
really big.

1169
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:05,960
MICHALE FEE: The
resistance gets big.

1170
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:10,070
The amount of current gets
small because there's less area

1171
01:04:10,070 --> 01:04:13,272
that the electric field is in.

1172
01:04:13,272 --> 01:04:14,480
And so the current goes down.

1173
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:15,855
That means the
resistance is big.

1174
01:04:15,855 --> 01:04:17,820
If we make our
plates really big,

1175
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:20,790
the resistance gets smaller.

1176
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:24,270
What happens if we pull
our plates further apart?

1177
01:04:24,270 --> 01:04:26,120
What happens to the resistance?

1178
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:27,800
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
further apart.

1179
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:28,730
MICHALE FEE: Good.

1180
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:30,950
If the plates are further
apart, L is bigger,

1181
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:32,030
and resistance is bigger.

1182
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:34,580
But conceptually,
what's going on?

1183
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:37,000
Physically, what's going?

1184
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,010
The plates are further
apart, so what happens?

1185
01:04:39,010 --> 01:04:40,110
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1186
01:04:40,110 --> 01:04:41,500
MICHALE FEE: Right.

1187
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:43,450
The voltage difference
is the same,

1188
01:04:43,450 --> 01:04:46,430
but the distance is bigger.

1189
01:04:46,430 --> 01:04:50,620
And so the electric field,
which is voltage per distance,

1190
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:51,730
is smaller.

1191
01:04:51,730 --> 01:04:58,120
And that smaller electric field
produces a drift velocity.

1192
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:02,600
And that's why the
resistance goes up.

1193
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:05,250
Cool, right?

1194
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:06,690
OK.

1195
01:05:06,690 --> 01:05:12,560
Now, let's talk for a
minute about resistivity.

1196
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:18,140
So resistivity in the brain
is really, really lousy.

1197
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:23,270
The wires of the
brain are just awful.

1198
01:05:23,270 --> 01:05:26,110
So if you look at the
resistivity for copper, which

1199
01:05:26,110 --> 01:05:30,700
is which is the wire
that's used in electronics,

1200
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:36,940
the resistivity is 1.6
microohms times centimeters.

1201
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:40,780
What that means is if I took a
block of copper, a centimeter

1202
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:44,080
on a side, and I put
electrodes on the side of it,

1203
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:48,730
and I measured the resistance,
it would be 1.6 microohms.

1204
01:05:51,705 --> 01:05:59,460
That means I could run an amp,
that thing with 1.6 microvolts.

1205
01:06:05,550 --> 01:06:09,810
Now the resistivity of the
brain is 60 ohms centimeters.

1206
01:06:09,810 --> 01:06:14,190
That means a centimeter of
block of saline solution,

1207
01:06:14,190 --> 01:06:18,770
intracellular or
extracellular solution,

1208
01:06:18,770 --> 01:06:24,890
has a resistance of 60 ohms
instead of 1.6 microohms.

1209
01:06:24,890 --> 01:06:27,395
It's more than a
million times worse.

1210
01:06:30,030 --> 01:06:35,380
And what that means is that
when you try to send current

1211
01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:38,990
through brain, you try
to send some current,

1212
01:06:38,990 --> 01:06:41,580
the voltage just drops.

1213
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:45,360
You need huge voltage drops
to produce tiny currents.

1214
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:55,910
That's why the brain
has invented things--

1215
01:06:55,910 --> 01:07:00,710
axons-- because the
wires are so bad that you

1216
01:07:00,710 --> 01:07:02,900
can't send a signal from
one part of the brain

1217
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:05,360
to another part of the
brain through the wire.

1218
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:08,270
You have to invent this special
gimmick called an action

1219
01:07:08,270 --> 01:07:14,240
potential to send a signal
more than a few microns away.

1220
01:07:17,910 --> 01:07:20,580
It's pretty cool, right?

1221
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:24,810
That's why it's so interesting
to understand the basic physics

1222
01:07:24,810 --> 01:07:28,260
of something, the basic
mechanisms by which something

1223
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:31,230
works because most
of what you see

1224
01:07:31,230 --> 01:07:36,170
is a hack to compensate
for weird physics, right?

1225
01:07:36,170 --> 01:07:36,670
Yes?

1226
01:07:36,670 --> 01:07:38,594
AUDIENCE: Does this [INAUDIBLE]?

1227
01:07:44,366 --> 01:07:50,570
MICHALE FEE: This
high resistivity--

1228
01:07:50,570 --> 01:07:54,290
you're asking what causes
that high resistivity.

1229
01:07:54,290 --> 01:07:59,660
It basically has to do with
things like the mean-free path

1230
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:01,190
of the particle.

1231
01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:06,050
So in a metal, particles
can go further effectively

1232
01:08:06,050 --> 01:08:06,980
before they collide.

1233
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:11,810
So the resistivity is lower.

1234
01:08:11,810 --> 01:08:15,007
AUDIENCE: Is that
slope [INAUDIBLE]??

1235
01:08:15,007 --> 01:08:17,340
MICHALE FEE: It's a little
bit different inside the cell

1236
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:19,410
because there's more
gunk inside of a cell

1237
01:08:19,410 --> 01:08:20,979
than there is outside of a cell.

1238
01:08:20,979 --> 01:08:23,310
And so the resistivity
is a little bit worse.

1239
01:08:23,310 --> 01:08:26,380
It's 2,000 ohms centimeters,
or 1,000 or 2,000

1240
01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:28,770
inside the cell and
more like 60 outside.

1241
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:30,900
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1242
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:32,830
MICHALE FEE: Yes once
you're outside the cell,

1243
01:08:32,830 --> 01:08:34,956
it's basically the
same everywhere.

1244
01:08:39,630 --> 01:08:40,130
OK?

1245
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:45,060
So that's it.

1246
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:48,029
So here's what we
learned about today.

1247
01:08:48,029 --> 01:08:53,890
We understood the relation
between the timescale

1248
01:08:53,890 --> 01:08:55,529
of diffusion and length scales.

1249
01:08:55,529 --> 01:09:00,840
And we learned that the distance
that a particle can diffuse

1250
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:03,029
grows only as the
square root of time.

1251
01:09:06,069 --> 01:09:09,970
We understood how concentration
gradients lead to currents.

1252
01:09:09,970 --> 01:09:13,420
And we talked about
Fick's First Law

1253
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:16,870
that says that concentration
differences lead

1254
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:18,250
to particle flux.

1255
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:21,729
The flux is proportional to
the gradient or the derivative

1256
01:09:21,729 --> 01:09:23,560
of the concentration.

1257
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:27,850
And we also talked about how
the drift of charged particles

1258
01:09:27,850 --> 01:09:31,630
in an electric field
leads to currents,

1259
01:09:31,630 --> 01:09:37,000
and how the voltage current
relation obeys Ohm's Law.

1260
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,090
And we also talked about
the concept of resistivity

1261
01:09:40,090 --> 01:09:43,689
and how the resistivity in
the brain is really high

1262
01:09:43,689 --> 01:09:45,700
and makes the wires in
the brain really bad.

1263
01:09:48,649 --> 01:09:51,470
So that's all I have.

1264
01:09:51,470 --> 01:09:54,360
I will take any questions.

1265
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:54,900
Yes, Daniel?

1266
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:56,900
AUDIENCE: I just wanted
to introduce David.

1267
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:57,950
MICHALE FEE: OK.

1268
01:09:57,950 --> 01:09:58,970
Our other TA is here.

1269
01:10:01,690 --> 01:10:02,915
Any questions?

1270
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:05,910
Great.

1271
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:08,160
So we will see you--

1272
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:09,570
when is the first [AUDIO OUT]?

1273
01:10:09,570 --> 01:10:09,810
Is that--

1274
01:10:09,810 --> 01:10:10,602
AUDIENCE: Tomorrow.

1275
01:10:10,602 --> 01:10:12,320
MICHALE FEE: Tomorrow.

1276
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:15,320
So I will see you Thursday.
