TONY PRESCOTT:
Great pleasure to be

9
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,790
in Woods Hole, my
first visit here,

10
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,390
had a wonderful swim
in the sea yesterday.

11
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:33,790
Sheffield Robotics is across
both universities in Sheffield.

12
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:36,130
And it's been
founded since 2011,

13
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,490
but we've really been doing
robotics since the 1980s.

14
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,950
And I joined them in 1989.

15
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,570
And we do pretty much every
different kind of robotics,

16
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,740
but I'm going to talk
about biomimetics.

17
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,650
I also do what you might
call cognitive robotics.

18
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,000
And I collaborate with
Giorgio Metta on that,

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,760
but since he's
speaking too, I'm going

20
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,430
to focus on the more
animal-like robots

21
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,680
that we've been developing.

22
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,890
So this is one of
our latest projects.

23
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:08,260
This is a small,
autonomous, mobile robot,

24
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,330
which is a commercial
platform, which

25
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,840
will be available in the
UK, I think, next January.

26
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,570
And there will hopefully
be a developer program

27
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:19,330
for people that are
interested in helping

28
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:23,270
to develop the intelligence
for this robot.

29
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:27,310
So this is at a conference we
had in Barcelona last month.

30
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:31,000
And you can see that
it's a robot pet.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,720
And we've been
focusing on giving it

32
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,650
some effective
communication abilities,

33
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:40,870
responding
particularly to touch.

34
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:44,990
You can see that it's
orienting to stimuli.

35
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,135
It has stereo vision.

36
00:01:46,135 --> 00:01:47,470
It has stereo sound.

37
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:51,490
And it can orient
to visual stimuli

38
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,400
and also to auditory stimuli.

39
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,640
Here we're showing it
a picture of itself

40
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,730
on this magazine cover.

41
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:01,550
And the goal is to
demonstrate that we can,

42
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:05,320
in a commercial robot that
will cost less than $1,000,

43
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,770
considerably less, some
of the principles of how

44
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:12,140
the brain generates behavior.

45
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,500
So this robot is called MiRo.

46
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:19,360
It is based on some high-level
principles abstracted

47
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,450
from what we know about how
mammalian brains control

48
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:26,200
behavior, so it's a
relatively complex robot, 13

49
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,440
degrees of freedom, 3 arm
processes corresponding

50
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,360
to different
levels, if you like,

51
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,810
of the neuroaxis, the
central nervous system.

52
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:41,380
So once you start out with some
general ideas, and questions,

53
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,260
and issues about
how we might learn

54
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,890
from the biology in the
brain, how to develop robots,

55
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:51,730
and how we might use robots to
help us understand the brain.

56
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,880
And a central question
I think that robotics

57
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,170
can help us answer, and I
think that's a core question

58
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,510
in neuroscience, is what
you might call the problem

59
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,980
of behavioral integration.

60
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,650
And the neuroscientist
Ernest Barrington

61
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,090
summarized this quite nicely.

62
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,120
He said, "the phenomenon
so characteristic of living

63
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,660
organisms, so very difficult
to analyze, the fact

64
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,840
that they behave as wholes
rather than as the sum

65
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,700
of their constituent parts.

66
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,090
Their behavior
shows integration,

67
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,820
a process unifying the
actions of an organism

68
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,140
into patterns that involve
the whole individual."

69
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,500
And this picture of a squirrel
over here I think nicely

70
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,260
demonstrates this.

71
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,980
So of course this squirrel
is leaping from one branch

72
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,030
to the next.

73
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,370
And you can see that
every part of his body

74
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,640
is coordinated and
organized for this action,

75
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,430
so you can see that his
eyes looking straight ahead,

76
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,830
his whiskers-- and I'll talk
a lot more about whiskers--

77
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,250
pointing forward.

78
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,930
His arms and his
feet are all ready

79
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:53,140
and they're there ready
to catch his fall.

80
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,840
Even his tail is
angled and positioned

81
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,670
to help him fly through the air.

82
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,820
So it's the coordination of the
different parts of the body,

83
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,130
and the multiple degrees
of freedom of the body,

84
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:07,060
and the sensory systems in space
and in time, which, I think,

85
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,170
is a critical problem
for biological control

86
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:14,200
and also a problem for robots,
which we're still struggling

87
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,290
to address with our robots.

88
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:19,209
And I want to give you two
very general principles

89
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:23,870
for thinking about how
brains solve this problem.

90
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:27,700
So many of you will have
come across Rodney Brooks,

91
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,710
yes, from MIT.

92
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:32,020
And he's famous
for, in robotics,

93
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:36,340
the notion of layered control,
which he called subsumption.

94
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,370
And I think the
ideas that he brought

95
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,740
into robotics really
changed how people thought

96
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,020
about robots in the 1980s.

97
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:49,060
But if we go back to the
1880s, John Hughlings Jackson,

98
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,950
who was a British neurologist,
proposed a similar idea,

99
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:56,270
but with respect to
the nervous system.

100
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:01,030
So in the 1880s, people
thought about the higher areas

101
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,510
of the brain,
particularly the cortex,

102
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:08,710
as being about higher thought,
and reasoning, and language,

103
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,460
and not so much about
perception and action.

104
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,500
And Hughlings Jackson, I think,
was revolutionary in his day

105
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,770
in saying, that the highest
motor senses represent over

106
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,110
again in more complex
combinations what

107
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,072
the middle motor
centers represent.

108
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:24,530
In other words, he was saying
that, the whole of the brain,

109
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:27,470
all the way up, is about
coordinating perception

110
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,490
with action.

111
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:31,460
And he described it in many
senses as a layered system.

112
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,080
He talked about how
you could take off

113
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,190
the top layers of the system
and the competences of the lower

114
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,440
layers remained intact,
which, of course, is

115
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,930
very much the idea of
Rodney Brooks subsumption

116
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,580
architecture.

117
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:47,660
And some old studies, they
did transection in animals

118
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,805
like cats and rats--
demonstrate this nicely.

119
00:05:49,805 --> 00:05:53,120
So if you take a cat or a
rat, particularly a rat,

120
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,245
and you remove, in fact,
all of the cerebral cortex,

121
00:05:56,245 --> 00:06:00,530
so if you make a slice here
that takes away cortex,

122
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:03,110
you get an animal that
actually, to all appearances,

123
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,280
looks fairly normal.

124
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,660
It does motivated
behavioral sequences,

125
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,737
so it will get hungry.

126
00:06:07,737 --> 00:06:08,820
And it will look for food.

127
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,220
And it will eat.

128
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,200
If there's an
appropriate mate nearby,

129
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,220
it will look to have
a sexual relationship.

130
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:21,050
And it will fail in some
challenges such as learning,

131
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:25,000
and perhaps also in dexterous
control, but in many ways,

132
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,910
it will look normal.

133
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:31,910
If you slice below the
other part of the forebrain,

134
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,610
the thalamus and
the hypothalamus,

135
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:37,100
you remove these areas, then
you remove this capacity

136
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,270
for motivated behavior, but you
leave intact midbrain systems

137
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,820
that can still generate
individual actions.

138
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,460
And if you remove
parts of the midbrain,

139
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,710
you leave intact, still,
component movements,

140
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,890
so for example, animals
that can run on a treadmill.

141
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:57,800
So we are, with our MiRo
robot, loosely recapitulating

142
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,070
this architecture, so we
have three processors.

143
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,720
And the idea with this robot,
it's actually a part work,

144
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,760
so you build it up.

145
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,790
You get a magazine every week
with a new part for the robot.

146
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:10,580
And you build, essentially,
a spinal robot first.

147
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,620
And then you add a
midbrain processor.

148
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:15,500
Eventually you add a
cortical processor,

149
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,470
which gives with it some
learning capacities,

150
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:22,280
some pattern recognition,
some navigation, so that's

151
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,800
one principle, layered
architecture, which

152
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,360
seems to work both for biology,
and perhaps in robotics.

153
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,600
So second principle,
and this goes back

154
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,270
to another famous
neuroscientist,

155
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:39,050
this time Wilder Penfield,
who is known to many people

156
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:42,770
for his discovery of
somatotopic maps in the brain,

157
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:46,960
that if you stimulate, in
the brain, in the area,

158
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,940
the sensory area, then
you find that people

159
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:53,240
have experience of tickling
on parts of the body.

160
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,330
And adjacent parts
of cortex correspond

161
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:58,100
to adjacent parts of the body.

162
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,830
And he found a similar
homunculus in the motor area

163
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:03,110
that you stimulate,
and you get movement

164
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,190
in adjacent parts of the body.

165
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:08,650
And he also proposed
another idea.

166
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:13,040
And that was sort of a
transencephalic dimension

167
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,870
to nervous system organization.

168
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,330
And that's to say
that, down the midline

169
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,330
of the central
nervous system, there

170
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:22,430
are a group of structures that
don't seem to be specifically

171
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:26,690
involved in specific aspects
of perception and action,

172
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,940
but seem to be
about integration.

173
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:32,010
And amongst them, particularly
the basal ganglia,

174
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,919
he noted as being
important, and parts

175
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,809
of the reticular formation.

176
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:38,690
So Michael Frank was
here talking to you

177
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,330
about basal ganglia,
so I'm not going

178
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:45,350
to say much more about this,
but this is just to point out,

179
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,870
in an slice in the
rat brain, these

180
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:51,320
are the elements of the
basal ganglia, particularly,

181
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,720
the striatum is
the input system.

182
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,210
In the rat, the substantia nigra
and part of the globus pallidus

183
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,850
are the output systems.

184
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:03,350
And then you have, in the rat
brain, and also in our brains,

185
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,720
you have massive
convergence onto the input

186
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:10,100
area, the caudate putamen it
is also called, from the cortex

187
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,610
and from the brain stem.

188
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,000
So you have signals coming
in from all over the brain

189
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,490
to the striatum, which
could be interpreted

190
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,570
as a request for action.

191
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,720
And then you have
inhibition coming out

192
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,030
from the output structures
of the basal ganglia,

193
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,370
here I'm showing it for
the substantia nigra,

194
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:28,040
going back to all of
those areas of the brain.

195
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,810
And this inhibition is tonic.

196
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,760
And in order to have
functional reaction,

197
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,680
you have to remove
the inhibition.

198
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:39,770
So this is a system
that can give you

199
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,240
some of that
behavioral integration

200
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,790
that you need, the
ability to ensure that you

201
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,620
do one thing at a time.

202
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,870
You do that quickly.

203
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,150
You do that consistently.

204
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,700
You dedicate all of your
resources to the action

205
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,870
that you want to do.

206
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:57,200
Here's a little video of a rat.

207
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,710
And I'm showing you some
integrated behavior over time

208
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,790
in an intact rat.

209
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:05,600
So this is a rat exploring
in a large container.

210
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,089
And rats generally
don't like open spaces,

211
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:10,130
so when you first put the
animal into this space,

212
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:12,800
it will tend to
stay near the walls.

213
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,320
And it prefers this
corner, which is dark.

214
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,470
And of course, it's hungry too,
so there's a dish of food here.

215
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,120
And eventually, it
gets up the courage

216
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,710
to go out, collect
a piece of food,

217
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:26,060
and it will take it back into
this dark corner to consume it.

218
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,080
And one of the first
models that we built

219
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,200
was a model of basal ganglia
operating as this, kind of,

220
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,070
action-selection device.

221
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,490
And with a simple
Kepler robot, this

222
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:39,870
is a robot that just really uses
infrared sensors and a gripper

223
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:40,900
arm.

224
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:44,680
And we are using a model
of the basal ganglia

225
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,010
to control decision
making about which actions

226
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:51,820
to do at which time, and
to generate sequencing

227
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,150
of those actions.

228
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:58,120
So as the need to stay
close to walls diminishes,

229
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,780
the robot, like the rat, goes
and collects these cylinders.

230
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:05,230
And it carries them back into
the corners and deposits them.

231
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:08,820
So a model of the central
brain structures-- and I'm

232
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:12,415
happy to discuss in more detail
about how that model operates,

233
00:11:12,415 --> 00:11:14,560
and how similarities
to the model

234
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,270
that Michael will
have described to you,

235
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:19,000
but that's controlling the
behavior switching, if you

236
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,980
like, in this robot.

237
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:27,250
So I spent some time working
on this question of how

238
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,850
central systems in the brain,
particularly the basal ganglia,

239
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:33,470
are involved in the
integration of behavior,

240
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:36,550
but I became frustrated
with not understanding what

241
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:39,740
were the signals coming in to
the central brain structures

242
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,820
and not understanding
what effects those brain

243
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:47,030
structures were having on the
motor system of the animal.

244
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:49,000
So I thought that
what we needed to do

245
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,190
was look at complete
sensory motor loops.

246
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:55,330
We needed to look at sensing and
action, and how those interact.

247
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,640
And in our Psychology
Department,

248
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,260
we have a neuroscience
group that

249
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,930
works mainly with rats,
so it was natural for us

250
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,670
to look at the rat.

251
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:07,450
And in the rat, we know that one
of the key perception systems

252
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,200
is the vertebral system.

253
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,560
So here you see, this
is actually a pet rat,

254
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,480
wandering around
on my windowsill

255
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,040
in my house in Sheffield.

256
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,400
And the thing to notice
is the whiskers here.

257
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,500
And the whiskers are moving
back and forth pretty

258
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,430
much all the time that
the rat is exploring.

259
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:29,980
And we understand from nearly
100 years now of research

260
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,530
that this system is very
important for the rat

261
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:33,860
to understand the environment.

262
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,040
In fact, if it's
completely dark,

263
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,620
the rat would move around
in much the same way.

264
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,240
And it would be
able to understand

265
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,030
the world through
touch pretty well, even

266
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,970
in the absence of vision.

267
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:48,310
So this is the same
video, but now slow down

268
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:51,910
10 times, and just to
show you these movements

269
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,400
of the whiskers, and how
quite precise they are,

270
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,540
because the rat isn't just,
in a stereotypical way,

271
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,640
banging its whiskers
against the floor.

272
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,530
It is lightly
touching the whiskers

273
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,690
in places it will get
useful information.

274
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:07,930
And you can see, when he puts
his head over the window sill

275
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:10,630
here, the whiskers
push forward, as

276
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,160
if he knows that
he's going to have

277
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,140
to reach further forward if
he's going to find anything.

278
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,590
Here you see him
exploring this wooden cup.

279
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:20,740
And you can see light
touches by the whiskers.

280
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,440
And you can also see that
the movement of the whiskers

281
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,050
is being modulated by
the shape of the surface

282
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,020
that he's investigating,
so there's

283
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,670
some fairly subtle
control happening here.

284
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,740
And I think it's
not too much to say

285
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:36,430
that the way in which the
rat controls its whiskers

286
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:38,200
has almost the same
richness as the way

287
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,030
that we control our fingertips.

288
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,680
So I'm interested in
how this plays out

289
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,200
in terms of a layered
architecture story.

290
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,880
And of course, many
people study this system.

291
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,630
The beauty of it is, if
you're a neuroscientist,

292
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:55,040
that you can look in the cortex.

293
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,310
This is rat cortex here.

294
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:02,050
And a huge area of rat cortex
is dedicated to somatosensation,

295
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:06,010
to touch, of which a large
area is dedicated to whiskers.

296
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,480
In fact, you zoom
in, you can find

297
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,490
this area called barrel cortex.

298
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,260
And with the right
kind of staining,

299
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:15,700
you can find groups of cells
which preferentially receive

300
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,070
signals from
individual whiskers,

301
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:21,430
so for example, you can
move one whisker here,

302
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:25,560
and you can know exactly where
you record in the barrel cortex

303
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,970
to get a very strong
response from that whisker.

304
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,820
And this means that barrel
cortex and the whisker system

305
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:35,170
has become one of the prepared,
preferred preparations in which

306
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:38,890
to study the cortical
microcircuit altogether,

307
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:41,650
so people study this
system to really understand

308
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:44,110
how cortex operates.

309
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,390
Now, if we think
about this system

310
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:50,110
as a pathway from the
whiskers up to barrel cortex,

311
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:52,210
we're really only
capturing one element

312
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:54,940
of what's going on in
the vertebral system.

313
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,570
And that's this pathway
here from the vertebrae,

314
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:00,520
via the trigeminal complex,
goes by the thalamus

315
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,180
up to sensory cortex.

316
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,920
And this is probably where 9
out of 10 papers on this system

317
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,800
are published, but
actually, this system

318
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,420
is only part of a
looped architecture,

319
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,660
or we might say, a
layered architecture.

320
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,210
And at each level of this
layered architecture,

321
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:20,890
there's a completed loop, so
that sensing can affect action,

322
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:25,060
so sensing on the vertebrae can
affect the movement and control

323
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,770
of the vertebrae.

324
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:28,810
So there's a loop
via the brainstem

325
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:32,470
here, so that, directly
from the trigeminal complex,

326
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:35,020
signals come back to the
facial nucleus, which

327
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:38,290
is where the motor neurons
are that move the whiskers.

328
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:40,600
There's a loop via
the midbrain here

329
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,390
so that sensory signals
ascend very quickly

330
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,490
to the midbrain
superior colliculus.

331
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:49,000
And they come back to affect
how the whiskers move.

332
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,970
And then, of course, there's
the loop via the cortex

333
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:54,750
too, so there's essentially
those three loops, at least,

334
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,920
that we need to think about.

335
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,350
So since 2003,
we've been building

336
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:02,800
different whiskered
robots, the aim being

337
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,140
to instantiate our
theories about how

338
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:08,280
whiskered control works in
this layered architecture

339
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,080
and demonstrate it
in a robot platform.

340
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,540
And often, actually,
building a robot platform

341
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,760
causes us to ask new
questions that might not

342
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,210
be obvious to you just by
doing biological experiments

343
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:21,952
or even by doing simulation.

344
00:16:21,952 --> 00:16:23,410
Before I show you
some robots, just

345
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:28,120
quickly show a little bit more
about the rat and its whiskers.

346
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,230
So we began thinking we
could just build robots,

347
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,260
but we quickly
realized that we didn't

348
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,970
know enough about how rats
use their whiskers to do that.

349
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,874
And that's partly because the
experiments that had been done

350
00:16:37,874 --> 00:16:39,790
haven't been done with
the purpose of building

351
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,260
a whiskered robot.

352
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,810
So when you try and
build a whiskered robot,

353
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:46,680
you have to ask questions
like, how do the whiskers move?

354
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,600
And when you look at a video
like this filmed from above,

355
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,580
this is with a
high speed camera,

356
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,130
you think, well, the whiskers
are sweeping backward

357
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:56,110
and forward, like this.

358
00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:00,580
But in fact, if you put a
mirror just tilted down here

359
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,146
and you see what
happens, then it

360
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,770
turns out to be a
little bit different,

361
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:07,450
so you see that the whiskers
are going up and down as much

362
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:10,010
as they are going
backwards and forwards.

363
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:12,300
So the whiskers are
actually sweeping like this,

364
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:16,290
and they're making a series
of touches on the surface.

365
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:20,560
And if you watch, you can
see that the whiskers are

366
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,800
sort of playing down on the
surface, sort of in a sequence,

367
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,819
quite quickly, so that
information might be giving you

368
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:31,870
details about the shape of
the surfaces in your world.

369
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:33,640
So we mainly look at
the long whiskers.

370
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,590
This is a rat that's
running up an alley.

371
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:38,560
And we put an unexpected
object in the alley, which

372
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,950
could be this
aluminum rectangle,

373
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:44,350
or it could be
this plastic step.

374
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:47,050
And what you see is, if the
animal encounters something

375
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:49,420
unexpected with its
long whiskers, then

376
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:52,150
it turns very quickly
and investigates it.

377
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,970
So the long whiskers
are like the periphery

378
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,640
of a sensory system
that has a fovea.

379
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,070
And the fovea at the
center of that system

380
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:02,950
is a set of short whiskers
around the mouth, also

381
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:06,700
the lips and the
nose, so that you

382
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,670
can sniff and smell the surface
that you're investigating.

383
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:13,180
So we can zoom in and see
that sensory fovea, here you

384
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:16,690
see these short whiskers that
are being used to investigate

385
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:20,219
this plastic puck, and the
longer whiskers investigating

386
00:18:20,219 --> 00:18:21,010
around the outside.

387
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,710
So we have
recapitulated elements

388
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,890
of this layered
architecture in our robot.

389
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:31,060
And this is-- these
are the loops.

390
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,260
And this was about
five years ago,

391
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,650
we built a system with
a brain stem loop,

392
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,260
and really, midbrain loop.

393
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,770
And this is our
robot Scratchbot,

394
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:43,750
which is the first of
the whiskered robots

395
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:47,395
that we felt really was
capturing whisking in the way

396
00:18:47,395 --> 00:18:48,380
that the rat does it.

397
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:52,780
It's running at about 4
hertz, whereas the real rat is

398
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,150
whisking from 8 to
12 hertz, but it's

399
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:58,780
scaled up to be about
four times rat size.

400
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,640
And what it's
doing here is, it's

401
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,680
using the whiskers
to orient to stimuli,

402
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,380
so this is Martin Pearson
from Bristol Robotics Lab.

403
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:08,290
He's putting an object
in the whisker field.

404
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:11,260
And the robot is
turning and orienting

405
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,980
to the touch with the object.

406
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,520
It's putting its short
micro vibrissae, in fact,

407
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,020
against the object
and exploring it.

408
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:21,340
Now to do that, to detect
a stimulus on the whiskers

409
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:24,680
and then turn is not a
fantastically hard task.

410
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,640
The main challenge
is to work out

411
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,650
where the whisker
was in its sweep

412
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,270
when you made contact
with an object,

413
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,322
because the whisker is
sweeping back and forth,

414
00:19:33,322 --> 00:19:34,780
so if you want to
know the location

415
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,370
of the point of
contact, you need

416
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:41,530
to integrate the position of the
whisker in its sweep, what you

417
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:44,590
might call a theta
signal, and the presence

418
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,210
of the contact on the whiskers.

419
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:49,700
And the coincidence of those
two is detected in the brain.

420
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,210
And we know that there are
cells in the barrel cortex

421
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:54,520
that respond to
that coincidence.

422
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,340
So we have in our robot a model
of the super colliculus, which

423
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,200
is the location in
the brain which we

424
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,900
think is involved in orienting.

425
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,480
And in our model
of the colliculus,

426
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,970
we have a head-centered
map, which

427
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:10,660
looks for this coincidence
between a cell encoding

428
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,370
the position of the whisker
in its sweep and a cell

429
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:17,710
encoding a contact and makes
a turn to orient and explore

430
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:20,177
that position.

431
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,760
And then if we want
to actually create

432
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,860
behavior, which is
integrated over time,

433
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:28,030
so if the robot was just to
orient every time it touched

434
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:31,080
something, that wouldn't
be very animal-like,

435
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,960
particularly, you
don't want to orient

436
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,230
every time you touch
the ground, so you just

437
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:38,140
want to orient when you
touch important stimuli.

438
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,820
So we put into our
model the basal ganglia

439
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:44,020
so that we can decide whether
the contact we've just made

440
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,850
is something we
want to investigate

441
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:49,100
or something that doesn't
interest us so much.

442
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,570
So we have a system
now with a midbrain

443
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:55,630
that does orienting, a basal
ganglia that makes decisions

444
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,160
about sequencing.

445
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,810
And those two things
together give us

446
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:03,450
reasonably lifelike behavior
in our robot, Scratchbot.

447
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:05,800
And that's quite
a lot of what we

448
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,710
have running now on the new
robot, MiRo, is this system.

449
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:11,180
It's for orienting
and exploring.

450
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,840
And we can use it-- we use it
here for tactile orienting,

451
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,520
but of course, the
same system can

452
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,170
underlie orienting
to sounds, if you

453
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:21,650
can localize those, and space,
and orienting to visual stimuli

454
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,020
too.

455
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,990
So it turns out that this
isn't a complete solution

456
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:29,260
to the problem of orienting
for our whiskered robot.

457
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,900
And that's because
sometimes our robot

458
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,690
would stop as it
was moving around

459
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:38,024
and just move and
investigate a point in space

460
00:21:38,024 --> 00:21:39,190
where nothing was happening.

461
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:41,579
We call that a ghost orient.

462
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:43,120
And the problem is
that the whiskers,

463
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,040
because they're
moving back and forth,

464
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,680
they sometimes generate
signals in the strain

465
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,770
gauges that are detecting
bending of the whisker.

466
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:52,390
And sometimes those
signals, just as

467
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:55,090
a consequence of the movement
and the mass of the whisker,

468
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:57,550
are strong enough to
be above threshold

469
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,570
to generate an
orient, so you get,

470
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:02,350
if you like, these
ghost-orienting movements

471
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,990
towards stimuli
that don't exist.

472
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,590
And we know that rats don't make
these kind of ghost orients,

473
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:11,920
so something else must
be going on in the brain.

474
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,240
And one part of the brain
that might be helping here

475
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,780
is a region called the
cerebellum, which, I'm not sure

476
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,360
if you've covered that
in the summer school,

477
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,180
but the cerebellum,
this large structure

478
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,980
at the back of the right brain.

479
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:29,010
One of its key
functions seems to be

480
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:32,510
to make predictions
about sensory signals,

481
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:35,580
and particularly, to be able
to predict sensory signals that

482
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,755
have been caused by
your own movement.

483
00:22:37,755 --> 00:22:39,510
And there's a lovely
experiment that's

484
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:43,200
been done by Blakemore et
al, where they put people

485
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,760
into a scanner.

486
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,360
And they investigated how they
responded to tickling stimuli.

487
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,270
So of course, if
somebody tickles you,

488
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,910
that can be quite amusing,
but unfortunately,

489
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:56,940
if you try to tickle yourself,
it's really uninteresting.

490
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,670
It doesn't work as a stimulus.

491
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:04,530
And it's worth thinking about
why it is that self-tickling

492
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:06,150
is so unrewarding.

493
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,910
And one of the reasons is
that it's just not surprising.

494
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:12,160
You know what's going to happen
when you tickle yourself,

495
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,070
whereas if somebody
else is doing it,

496
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,290
it's unexpected and surprising.

497
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:20,670
So why is self-tickling
unexpected?

498
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,560
Why is it not surprising?

499
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,530
It must be because the brain
expects and anticipates

500
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:27,570
the signal that
it's going to get.

501
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:30,450
And what Blakemore
et al did was to show

502
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,910
that the cerebellum
really lights up

503
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:35,220
when you try to tickle
yourself, because it's

504
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,340
estimating and predicting
the sensory signal,

505
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,920
and using that to
cancel out, if you like,

506
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,130
the signal that's
coming from your skin.

507
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:48,030
The same thing is happening
in electric fish, which

508
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:50,490
generate this broad
electric field which

509
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:53,242
they use for catching prey.

510
00:23:53,242 --> 00:23:55,200
And they need to be able
to tell the difference

511
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,800
between a distortion to the
electric field caused by a prey

512
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,350
animal and a distortion
caused by their own movement,

513
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,370
by swimming.

514
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:05,080
And they do that by having
a very large cerebellum.

515
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,780
So we put a model
of the cerebellum

516
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,700
in our whiskered robot.

517
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,020
And the cerebellum
predicts the noise

518
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,830
you might get due to the
movement of the whiskers.

519
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,930
And it learns
online to accurately

520
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:18,150
predict what noise
signals you might get,

521
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,920
and to cancel them
out, so you get

522
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:24,420
a much better signal-to-noise
ratio in the robot.

523
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:28,460
So we've dealt with whisking.

524
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,940
And we've dealt with orienting.

525
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:33,060
But as you saw with that
rat on the windowsill,

526
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,291
the whisker movements
are really precise.

527
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:36,540
And they're really controlled.

528
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,550
And the rat seems
to really care about

529
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:41,190
how it's moving its whiskers
and how it's touching.

530
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,290
We call this active sensing.

531
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:45,360
And if you look at
these high-speed videos,

532
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,220
you can see, for
instance, this rat

533
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,880
when it's exploring
this perspex block.

534
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,354
The whiskers aren't moving in
a stereotype symmetric way.

535
00:24:53,354 --> 00:24:55,770
You can see that here, the
whiskers on the right-hand side

536
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:57,940
are really reaching
round to try and reach

537
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,770
the other side of the block.

538
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:01,740
If you watch this rat
here, you see that too.

539
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,960
You've got asymmetry.

540
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,260
And you'll see that, even as
the rat comes up to the cylinder

541
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:10,710
here, the whiskers at the
front are pushing forward

542
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:14,170
while the ones at the back
are hardly moving at all,

543
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:16,350
so there's some ability to
control even the whiskers

544
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,130
on one side of the head.

545
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:20,064
And when you move your
fingers, of course,

546
00:25:20,064 --> 00:25:22,230
there's some coupling between
your finger movements.

547
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,510
You can't move them
entirely independently.

548
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,760
And each of these whiskers
has its own muscle,

549
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,490
so there's a degree
of independence

550
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:31,690
in how the whiskers can move.

551
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:34,720
And we find that when we
record over long intervals.

552
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,290
So this was a study--

553
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:37,580
[ELECTRONIC NOISE]

554
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:42,880
--in which we recorded the
whisking muscles using EMG.

555
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,410
And that's the sound that you
can hear as the rat explored.

556
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:50,270
And we tracked the rat
as he was moving around.

557
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,920
And we showed that,
whenever he came

558
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,060
close to the edge
of the box here,

559
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,720
the whiskers would
become asymmetric.

560
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,970
And the whiskers that were
furthest away from the wall

561
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:02,120
would push round to try and
touch the sides of the box.

562
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,490
The whiskers that
were close to the wall

563
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:06,180
would barely move at all.

564
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:10,280
So we want to put that kind
of control into our robot.

565
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:14,600
So I briefly want to come
back to this question of how

566
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,160
we decompose control.

567
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:21,470
So in our original robot
that was controlled

568
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:24,050
by the basal ganglia,
and it's collecting cans,

569
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:26,990
we decompose behaviors
into the different elements

570
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,120
of behavior--

571
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,520
looking for a can, picking it
up, carrying it to the wall,

572
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,880
these sorts of things.

573
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,180
And if we look in the
ethology literature,

574
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,400
we find that people have
talked about these kinds

575
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,850
of decompositions.

576
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:41,330
There's a very famous
paper by Baerends

577
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,780
about the herring gull.

578
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,310
And with the herring
gull, there's

579
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:50,090
this famous experiment where
the egg rolls out the nest.

580
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:53,360
And the bird will retrieve
the egg with its bill

581
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,220
and push it back into the nest.

582
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:59,340
And it will do this same action
really reliably and repeatedly.

583
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,250
And it can do it with
eggs of various size.

584
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,380
It might even do
it for a Coke can.

585
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,960
And if you take the egg
away during the movement,

586
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,970
it will still
complete the movement.

587
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:11,360
And ethologists have called
this a fixed action pattern,

588
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,100
so it may be that
behavior is decomposed

589
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,650
into action patterns.

590
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:17,630
And that's one of the
ways, for instance,

591
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:20,720
in which Rodney Brooks wants
to decompose robot behavior.

592
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,030
We decompose it into
different things

593
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,605
we might want the robot to do.

594
00:27:24,605 --> 00:27:26,480
And we can do that with
our whiskered robots.

595
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,020
Here's another one with
its behavior decomposed

596
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:32,090
into different kinds
of, if you like,

597
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:36,270
orienting behaviors and
fixed action patterns.

598
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,940
Another way to
decompose behavior

599
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:40,730
is to think about where
your attention is, so

600
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:43,070
where you put your
attention might decide

601
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,540
what you're going to do next.

602
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:47,180
And for an animal that
doesn't have arms,

603
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:51,080
and of course most animals
except humans and some primates

604
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,650
don't usually use their
forelimbs for much else

605
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:56,390
other than locomotion.

606
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:58,430
And they primarily
are positioning

607
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,840
their head and their face.

608
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,600
And their main effector,
then, is their mouth.

609
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,930
So where you position
your attention

610
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:08,520
could determine what
you're going to do next.

611
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,580
So another way of
decomposing control

612
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,977
is to solve the
attention problem first.

613
00:28:12,977 --> 00:28:14,685
And then once you
solve that, the problem

614
00:28:14,685 --> 00:28:17,180
of what you're going
to do is simplified.

615
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,940
So in this robot,
we're controlling it

616
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,190
by deciding where its
attention should go.

617
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:26,150
And then the rest of the
body kind of follows.

618
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:28,910
When humans have special
attention, of course,

619
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:31,560
we explore that in
the visual modality.

620
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,170
And we look at the saccadic
eye movements that people make.

621
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:37,940
So in the famous
experiment, Albert Yarbus

622
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,980
had people looking
at this picture

623
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,990
and tracking where
their eyes would look.

624
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:45,470
And of course, we look at the
socially-significant elements

625
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:48,080
of the picture, people's
faces and so on,

626
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,750
not just arbitrary points of
light, or corners, and so on.

627
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:57,170
And we can actually calculate
a saliency map for space

628
00:28:57,170 --> 00:29:00,140
and say what are the
important parts of space

629
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,690
for exploring and attending to.

630
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:07,370
And we've taken that idea and
transferred it into our model

631
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,630
for understanding the rat.

632
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:11,510
And we thought about tactile
saliency maps, so can

633
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,900
we, with a sense of
touch, think about areas

634
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:17,000
of the world which are important
to explore and understand

635
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,080
through touch?

636
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,110
And can we use that to
control the movement

637
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:24,470
of our robot, or in this
case, our simulation?

638
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:28,070
So here, we have a form of
emergent wall following, which

639
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:31,850
is a consequence of the
rat's spatial attention being

640
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:35,830
driven by contact with
vertical objects, which we--

641
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:39,230
we program it so that
the vertical surfaces

642
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:41,090
are salient and interesting.

643
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:43,130
And it has this salient zone.

644
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:46,610
And it tries to put its
whiskers into the salient zone.

645
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:49,700
And then here is a robot
instantiating this.

646
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,380
This is Ben Mitchinson,
who's programmed

647
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,730
many of these robots.

648
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,800
And so what we're
doing now is following

649
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,820
this biologically-inspired
orienting system

650
00:29:58,820 --> 00:29:59,930
to explore shapes.

651
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:03,350
And in this case, he put his
own face in front of the robot.

652
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:07,580
And you can see the robot making
light touches against his face

653
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:11,420
and investigating it, looking--

654
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:14,090
making a series of, if you
like, exploratory touches,

655
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:17,720
somewhat like saccades,
somewhat like what

656
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,670
you might imagine a
blind person would

657
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:21,740
do if they were
investigating your face

658
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,300
to try and recognize you.

659
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,310
And Mitra Hartmann
from Northwestern

660
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,200
has shown that you
can take signals

661
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,040
off these kinds of whiskers
and reconstruct a face,

662
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:33,410
so it should be
possible from this

663
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:36,960
to build up from the touches,
the sequence of touches,

664
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,080
a lot of rich information
about the object that's

665
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,480
being investigated.

666
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,202
How much time?

667
00:30:42,202 --> 00:30:42,910
I need to finish.

668
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:44,630
OK, let me just skip through.

669
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:47,362
So we've been doing--
working on the cortex.

670
00:30:47,362 --> 00:30:48,820
We have a number
of models of that,

671
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,580
which I'd like to
show you, but I

672
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,950
want to just finish,
just to make contact

673
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:56,980
with John's talk, is
that we've been doing,

674
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:00,640
in our robots, tactile
simultaneous localization

675
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,270
and mapping.

676
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:03,520
So this is our whiskered robot.

677
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,830
And we have various models
for this, some of which

678
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,780
are more hippocampal-like.

679
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:10,130
This one, I think, was more
of an engineered model.

680
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:12,700
But you can see the
robot just using touch

681
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,340
on these artificial
whiskers, building up

682
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,090
a map of its environment.

683
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:19,600
These two lines show its
dead-reckoning position

684
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,490
and its calculated position.

685
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:24,550
And just using touch,
we can build up

686
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:28,220
a reasonably accurate map of
the world that we're exploring.

687
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,210
So Giorgio will
talk about the iCub.

688
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:33,730
And I just wanted to mention
that, in the work we're

689
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:36,280
doing with Giorgio, we
are very much trying

690
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,360
to understand human cognition.

691
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,680
I wrote a short article for New
Scientist on the possibility

692
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,640
that robots might
one day have selves.
