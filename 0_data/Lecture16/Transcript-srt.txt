1
00:00:12,896 --> 00:00:15,860
MICHALE FEE: OK, good
morning, everyone.

2
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:20,810
OK, so today we are
going to continue

3
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:23,600
the process of building
our equivalent circuit

4
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,060
model of a neuron.

5
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:31,040
This model was actually
developed in the late '40s

6
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,350
and early '50s by Alan
Hodgkin and Andrew

7
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:38,180
Huxley, who started working on
the problem of understanding

8
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,680
how neurons make
action potentials.

9
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,310
And so they studied
the squid giant axon,

10
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,340
which is actually a
very cool preparation,

11
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,520
because that axon is actually
about a millimeter across,

12
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,300
and so you can stick
wires inside of it.

13
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,620
And they did a bunch of
very cool experiments

14
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:01,368
to figure out how these
different ionic conductances

15
00:01:01,368 --> 00:01:03,410
and how these different
components of the circuit

16
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:08,360
work together to make
an action potential.

17
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,300
So that's what we're
going to continue doing,

18
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,260
we're going to
essentially continue

19
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,050
describing and motivating
the different components

20
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,260
of this circuit.

21
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:23,990
So today, we're going to
get through the process

22
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:28,280
of introducing a
voltage-measuring device,

23
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,610
a current source, a
capacitor, a conductance,

24
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:36,930
and we're going to start
introducing a battery, OK?

25
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,430
OK.

26
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:42,260
So here's what we want
to accomplish today.

27
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:46,070
So we want to understand how
kind of at the simplest level

28
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:50,780
how neurons respond
to injected currents,

29
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,340
we want to understand
how membrane

30
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:56,120
capacitance and membrane
resistance allows neurons

31
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,670
to integrate their
inputs over time,

32
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:02,870
and to filter their inputs or
smooth their inputs over time--

33
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:06,620
and that particular model is
called a resistor capacitor

34
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:11,500
model or an RC
model of a neuron.

35
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,140
We're going to go through how
to derive the differential

36
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,680
equations that describe that
model-- it's actually quite

37
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,260
simple, but some
of you may not have

38
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,780
been through that before,
so I want to go through it

39
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,030
step by step so we
can really understand

40
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,300
where that comes from.

41
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,935
And we're going to learn to
basically look at a current--

42
00:02:31,935 --> 00:02:33,780
a pattern of current
injection, and we

43
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,780
should be able to
intuitively see

44
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,860
how the voltage of
that neuron responds.

45
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,950
And we're going to
start working on where

46
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:49,280
the batteries of a neuron
actually come from, OK?

47
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:49,900
OK.

48
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,490
So-- all right.

49
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:54,760
So-- all right.

50
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:59,345
So we're going to basically
talk about the following sort

51
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,340
of thought experiment, OK?

52
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,990
The following conceptual idea.

53
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:05,300
We're going to take
a neuron and we're

54
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,090
going to put it in a
bath of sailing, OK?

55
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,850
A saltwater solution that
represents the extracellular

56
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:14,300
solution that neurons--

57
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,770
extracellular
solution in the brain.

58
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,640
And we're going to put an
electrode into that neuron

59
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,710
so that we can inject
current, and we're

60
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,120
going to put another
electrode into the neuron

61
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,760
so that we can
measure the voltage,

62
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,540
and we're going to study
how this neuron responds--

63
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,950
how the voltage of the neuron
responds to current injections,

64
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,850
OK?

65
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:38,120
Now why is it that we
want to actually do that?

66
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:43,510
Why is that an interesting or
important experiment to do?

67
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,880
Anybody have any
idea why we would

68
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,997
want to actually measure
voltage and current

69
00:03:48,997 --> 00:03:50,080
for a neuron in the brain?

70
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:55,230
Yes?

71
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:58,050
AUDIENCE: Be able to use the
mathematical model [INAUDIBLE]

72
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:58,990
provided for us?

73
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:02,130
MICHALE FEE: OK, but
it's more than just

74
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:05,760
so that we can describe
it mathematically, right?

75
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,410
It's because these things--

76
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,120
something about
voltage and current

77
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,030
are actually relevant to
how a neuron functions.

78
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,530
Yes?

79
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,140
AUDIENCE: Like the
resistance inside?

80
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,130
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

81
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,230
So that's an important
quantity, but we're

82
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,120
looking for something
more fundamental,

83
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,250
like why is it
actually important

84
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,300
that we understand how voltage
changes when a neuron has

85
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,990
current injected into it?

86
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:29,490
Habiba?

87
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,880
AUDIENCE: Equals [INAUDIBLE]
different like ion channels,

88
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,855
a different set of
voltages [INAUDIBLE]..

89
00:04:35,855 --> 00:04:36,730
MICHALE FEE: Exactly.

90
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:40,220
So ion channels are
sensitive to voltage,

91
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,900
and the way they function
depends very critically

92
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,830
on voltage.

93
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:48,550
So many-- if not
most-- ion channels

94
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:54,550
are voltage sensitive and are
controlled by voltage, OK?

95
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,070
And that's exactly why.

96
00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:00,280
So nearly every aspect of
what neurons do in the brain

97
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:05,440
as you're walking around looking
at things and doing things

98
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,330
is controlled by
voltage, and that

99
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:11,340
goes through the voltage
sensitivity of buying channels,

100
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,070
OK?

101
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:15,700
But what is it that changes
the voltage in a neuron?

102
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:22,530
Yes?

103
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,620
AUDIENCE: The action potential.

104
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,790
MICHALE FEE: That's
on the output side.

105
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:28,290
Yes?

106
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,490
AUDIENCE: Is it
ion concentration?

107
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:31,500
MICHALE FEE: Good.

108
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,300
That's correct.

109
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,080
I'm looking for something
a little bit different.

110
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:37,580
Habiba?

111
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,570
AUDIENCE: Do you have
pumps or [INAUDIBLE]..

112
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:42,288
MICHALE FEE: Yeah, those
are all good answers.

113
00:05:42,288 --> 00:05:43,580
Not quite what I'm looking for.

114
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,320
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

115
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,880
MICHALE FEE: Yes.

116
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,050
So the answer is that
the voltage of a neuron

117
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,270
changes because--

118
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:59,260
the reason current is important
is because the reason voltage

119
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:03,280
changes in a neuron is because
other cells are injecting

120
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,590
current into our neuron.

121
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:10,390
Sensory inputs are injecting
current into our neuron, OK?

122
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:14,050
Everything that a neuron
receives, all the information

123
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:17,380
that a neuron receives from
other neurons in the network

124
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,740
and from the outside world
comes from currents being

125
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:24,190
injected into that neuron, OK?

126
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,200
And so it's really
important that we understand

127
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:31,810
how the neuron transforms that
current input from other cells

128
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:36,790
and from the sensory periphery
into voltage changes that

129
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,670
then change the behavior
of ion channels.

130
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:40,720
Is that clear?

131
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,310
That link of current
inputs to voltage output

132
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,170
is really crucial,
and that's why we're

133
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:49,090
doing this experiment, OK?

134
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:55,880
OK, and that's this
point right here.

135
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,380
OK, so one of the
first things we're

136
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,320
going to see when we go
through this analysis

137
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,170
is that neurons can
perform analog integration.

138
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:07,270
They can perform numerical
integration over time, OK?

139
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,130
That's pretty cool.

140
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:14,470
Voltage is that integral over
time of the injected current.

141
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,030
To first order.

142
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:18,252
It's the simplest
behavior of a neuron.

143
00:07:18,252 --> 00:07:19,960
So if you measure the
voltage of a neuron

144
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,410
and you turn on current and
you turn the current on,

145
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,620
the voltage of a
neuron will ramp up,

146
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,320
integrating that
input over time, OK?

147
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,490
Pretty cool.

148
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,590
So we're going to
see how that happens,

149
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:36,430
why that happens biophysically.

150
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,000
OK.

151
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So let's come back to
our neuron in the dish.

152
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,700
Let me just explain a little
bit how you would actually

153
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,640
do this experiment.

154
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,790
So these electrodes are
little pieces of glass tubing.

155
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:49,060
So you take a fine glass
tube about a millimeter

156
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,970
across you heat it up in
the middle over a flame,

157
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:54,610
and you pull it apart when
it melts in the middle,

158
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:57,340
and it makes a very sharp point.

159
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:02,140
You break off the fine little
thread of glass that's left,

160
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:05,440
and you have a tube that narrows
down to a very sharp point,

161
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,375
but it's still a tube, and
you can literally just--

162
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,750
there are some cells, like in
the old days people studied

163
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,203
large neurons and in
snails where the cells are

164
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:16,120
a millimeter across, you
can take an electrode

165
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,640
and literally just by hand
poke it into the cell.

166
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,870
And then you fill that
electrode with a salt solution,

167
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,510
and then you put a wire in
the back of that electrode,

168
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,440
and you hook it up
to an amplifier.

169
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,170
Now we want to measure
the voltage in the cell.

170
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:33,789
Remember, voltage is
always voltage difference.

171
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:35,380
We're always measuring
the difference

172
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,840
between the voltage in one place
and the voltage somewhere else.

173
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,450
So this amplifier
has two inputs.

174
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,630
It's called a
differential amplifier,

175
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,820
and we're going to hook
the electrode that's

176
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,680
in the cell to
the plus terminal,

177
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,620
we're going to put
a wire in the bath,

178
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,700
hook it to the minus
terminal, and this amplifier

179
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,310
is measuring the difference
between the voltage

180
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:57,490
inside the cell and the
voltage outside the cell, OK?

181
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:59,690
Any questions about that?

182
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:02,470
So we're going to take the other
half of that piece of glass

183
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:05,145
that we pulled, fill
it with salt solution,

184
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:07,270
stick it in the cell, and
we're going to hook it up

185
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,100
to a current source.

186
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,270
Now our current source is
basically just a battery, OK?

187
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:15,440
But it's got some
fancy electronics

188
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,170
such that the current that flows
is equal to whatever value you

189
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:25,020
set, OK?

190
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,975
And of course,
remember, that voltage

191
00:09:26,975 --> 00:09:31,790
is in units of volts and
current is charge per second.

192
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:35,150
Charge is coulombs, so
coulombs per second,

193
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:39,460
and that's equal to the unit
of current, which is amperes.

194
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,060
All right.

195
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:44,770
Now let's take a closer look
at our little spherical neuron,

196
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:45,970
our little neuron.

197
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,990
We've chopped all the
dendrites and axons off,

198
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,860
so it's just a little
sphere, and you can basically

199
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:56,470
model a neuron just like any
other cell as a spherical shell

200
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,740
of insulating material, OK?

201
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,050
In this case, a lipid bilayer.

202
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,050
This is a phospholipid bilayer.

203
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:08,770
Phospholipids are just little
fat molecules that have a polar

204
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:11,530
head on one side-- that means
they're soluble in water

205
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:14,620
on this side, and they
have a non-polar tail,

206
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,780
so they don't like to be
in contact with water,

207
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:20,410
and the two polar
tails go end to end--

208
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,900
sorry, the non-polar
tails go end to end,

209
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,320
the polar heads face
out into the water.

210
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,480
Does that makes sense?

211
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,330
And they are very closely
packed together so

212
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,880
that ions can't pass
through that membrane,

213
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,310
so it's insulating.

214
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:40,290
It's very thin, it's only
about 23 angstroms across, OK?

215
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:45,100
An angstrom is about the
size of a hydrogen atom.

216
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,030
They're very thin, OK?

217
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,870
OK, we have saline inside.

218
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,720
What is saline?

219
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,505
What is it in our model?

220
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,882
Remember on Tuesday what--

221
00:11:00,882 --> 00:11:01,590
AUDIENCE: A wire.

222
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,340
MICHALE FEE: Good.

223
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:07,090
It's a wire and we have saline
outside, which is also a wire.

224
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:11,160
So we have two wires separated
by an insulator, what is that?

225
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,530
That's a capacitor, because
it's two conductors separated

226
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,360
by an insulator, OK?

227
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,445
So an electrical component
that behaves like a capacitor--

228
00:11:27,445 --> 00:11:29,070
like if you were to
build one of those,

229
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:32,340
you would take like a
piece of aluminum foil,

230
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:35,220
put a piece of paper on it, put
another piece of aluminum foil

231
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,070
next to it, and
attach wires to that,

232
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:41,580
and you would squeeze the
stack of aluminum foil paper

233
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:45,450
and aluminum foil together, and
that becomes a capacitor, OK?

234
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:49,760
And it has a symbol that
looks like this electrically.

235
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:55,360
So this is now our equivalent
circuit of this model neuron,

236
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:55,970
OK?

237
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,240
It's very simple.

238
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,810
It's a capacitor
with one wire here

239
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:03,970
that represents the inside of
the cell, another wire that

240
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:08,160
represents the
outside of the cell.

241
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,680
We have a current
source that connects

242
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,710
the outside of the cell
to the inside of the cell.

243
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,180
When we turn on
the current source,

244
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:19,260
it takes charges
from inside of here

245
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:22,710
and sticks them
through the electrode

246
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,990
and pumps them into the cell.

247
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,900
Does that makes sense?

248
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:32,960
This is our-- this is sort
of a simplified symbol

249
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,690
for a voltage-measuring device.

250
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,630
The voltage difference
between the inside of the cell

251
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,660
and the outside of the cell
is what we're measuring here,

252
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,930
and that difference is called
the membrane potential.

253
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:48,560
It's the voltage difference
between the inside

254
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,470
and the outside of the
membrane, all right?

255
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,970
Any questions about that?

256
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:53,670
Yes?

257
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,970
AUDIENCE: There's a narrow
resistance for [INAUDIBLE]..

258
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:56,727
MICHALE FEE: What's that?

259
00:12:56,727 --> 00:12:57,920
AUDIENCE: The resistance for--

260
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,610
MICHALE FEE: Yes,
but we're going

261
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,000
to do it one piece at a time.

262
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,960
So we're going to
start with a capacitor.

263
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,340
The resistor will
come in a few slides.

264
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,098
Yes?

265
00:13:09,098 --> 00:13:10,535
AUDIENCE: So the [INAUDIBLE].

266
00:13:17,455 --> 00:13:18,330
MICHALE FEE: Exactly.

267
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,790
So we've simplified our
neurons so that it's

268
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:24,300
just an insulating shell, OK?

269
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,090
No ion channels, no
current anywhere else.

270
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:31,020
If we want to inject current
into this simple model neuron,

271
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:34,700
we have to inject it through
this electrode here, OK?

272
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:39,730
So we're just going down
to the very simplest case,

273
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:42,780
because this is already
kind of interesting enough

274
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,190
to understand just by itself.

275
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:44,996
Yes?

276
00:13:44,996 --> 00:13:47,170
AUDIENCE: So if the cell's
acting as a capacitor,

277
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:50,975
is their energy stored
in their myelin?

278
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,350
MICHALE FEE: The
energy is stored

279
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,270
in the electric field
that crosses the bilayer,

280
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,645
and I'll get to
that in a second.

281
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,530
Any other questions?

282
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,868
OK, great questions.

283
00:14:02,868 --> 00:14:04,910
All right, so what happens
when we inject current

284
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:05,690
into our neuron?

285
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:09,740
As I said, the current
source is pulling charges

286
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:13,936
from the outside and pumping
them into the inside,

287
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,672
all right?

288
00:14:16,672 --> 00:14:23,170
So what happens when goes on?

289
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,830
So what we're doing is we
are injecting current-- let's

290
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,580
say this is our capacitor.

291
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:32,930
There are charges, there
are ions on the inside

292
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:36,380
that are just up against the
inside of the cell membrane.

293
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:40,250
There are charges
on the outside, OK?

294
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,560
And when we inject a charge
from the outside to the inside--

295
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,710
let's put one of those
charges right here.

296
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:48,460
And we're going to push it
into this cell, when you inject

297
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:52,100
a charge, you get
an excessive charge

298
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,060
on the inside of the
cell membrane, OK?

299
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,260
And what does that do?

300
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:02,120
You now have more positive
charges inside than outside,

301
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,500
like-charges repel--

302
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,770
so it pushes one
of those charges

303
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:10,453
away from the outside
of the membrane.

304
00:15:10,453 --> 00:15:11,370
Does that makes sense?

305
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,400
OK, that's kind of interesting.

306
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:23,650
We took a charge, we pushed
it in, and a charge comes out.

307
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:24,670
Right?

308
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,290
We have a current flowing.

309
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:29,360
We have charges coming
in and charges leaving.

310
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,130
We have a current flowing
through an insulator.

311
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:34,510
How is that possible?

312
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,750
It's a capacitive current, OK?

313
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:40,650
No charges are actually
passing through the insulator,

314
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:44,070
but it looks like you
have a current flowing.

315
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:46,470
That's called a
capacitive current.

316
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:51,320
And we represent that in
our diagram by a current

317
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,640
I sub C, capacitive current that
flows through the capacitor.

318
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,940
Pretty cool, right?

319
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,150
You have a current flowing
through an insulator.

320
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:02,180
That's what a capacitor is.

321
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,470
OK.

322
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:06,290
Now notice that you
have a charge imbalance.

323
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:09,110
You have three positive
charges here and only

324
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:11,460
one positive charge here.

325
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:14,330
So there is an excess of two
positive charges on the inside.

326
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:17,330
That's because we added a
positive charge to the inside

327
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:19,640
and took away a positive
charge from the outside,

328
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,680
so that leaves a charge
imbalance of 2, OK?

329
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,410
What do you get between positive
charge and negative charge

330
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,450
if you hold them
next to each other?

331
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:32,060
What is there in between?

332
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,482
AUDIENCE: It's attraction.

333
00:16:33,482 --> 00:16:34,940
MICHALE FEE: Good,
it's attraction,

334
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,010
but what is it that
causes that attraction?

335
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:40,880
Remember yesterday, we talked
about a something on a charge

336
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,178
produces a force, what is it?

337
00:16:42,178 --> 00:16:43,220
AUDIENCE: Electric field.

338
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:43,970
MICHALE FEE: Good.

339
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:47,570
So there's an electric
field between the positive--

340
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:51,230
the excess positive charges here
and the excess negative charges

341
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:52,790
here, OK?

342
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:55,790
That's an electric
field, all right?

343
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:58,140
And that electric
field stores energy.

344
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,680
How do you know there's
energy in this system, though?

345
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,870
What could you do to
demonstrate that there is

346
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:06,630
energy stored in that system?

347
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:07,460
Any ideas?

348
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,410
You have two plates, two
metal plates, let's say,

349
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,170
in the metal version of this.

350
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,150
Separated by an insulator.

351
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:18,280
What would happen if you
pulled away the insulator?

352
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,770
Those two things would do
that again, but louder--

353
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:21,640
boom.

354
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,599
What does that take
to make that sound?

355
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,310
Energy, OK?

356
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,380
So there's energy stored
in that electric field.

357
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,830
So there's a charge imbalance,
there's an electric field.

358
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:40,928
What does an electric field over
some distance correspond to?

359
00:17:40,928 --> 00:17:42,220
AUDIENCE: A voltage difference.

360
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,224
MICHALE FEE: A voltage
difference, OK?

361
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,650
Now, there's a charge imbalance
and a voltage difference,

362
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:54,060
and they're proportional
to each other.

363
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,510
So there's a
proportionality constant

364
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:59,830
that's called the
capacitance, all right?

365
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:04,990
If you can put a lot of charge
and have a small voltage

366
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:07,240
difference, that's
a big capacitor.

367
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,740
Now you can get a big capacitor
just by having a big area.

368
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:13,120
You can see, you can have a lot
of charges with a small voltage

369
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:18,610
difference if you have big
plates on your capacitor, OK?

370
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:21,760
So the capacitance is actually
proportional to the area

371
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,260
of the plates,
and it's inversely

372
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,060
proportional to the
distance between them.

373
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:29,260
It's a very thin
membrane, which means

374
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:33,700
you can get a lot of
capacitance in a tiny area, OK?

375
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,930
That's pretty cool.

376
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:39,910
All right, any questions?

377
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:44,080
So charge is coulombs, and there
are 6 times 10 to the charges

378
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,020
in a coulomb, the
elemental charges, electron

379
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:51,908
or monovalent ion charges.

380
00:18:51,908 --> 00:18:53,950
Voltage is in units of
volts, and the capacitance

381
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,270
is in units of farads.

382
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,020
Any questions?

383
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,640
All right.

384
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,340
So we have our relation between
voltage difference and charge

385
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,770
difference.

386
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:11,000
And what we're
going to do is we're

387
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,480
going to calculate this
capacitive current.

388
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,760
How do you think
we would calculate

389
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,780
the capacitive current?

390
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:24,650
Well, the capacitive
current is just

391
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:29,900
the rate at which the charge
imbalance is changing, right?

392
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:33,160
Current is just charge
per unit of time.

393
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,660
OK?

394
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:37,340
So we're going to calculate the
capacitive current as the time

395
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,900
rate of change of the charge--

396
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,570
and I've dropped
the deltas here.

397
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:46,480
So capacitive current
is dQ/dt, all right?

398
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,725
And remember that Q is just
CV, so the capacitive current

399
00:19:50,725 --> 00:19:54,490
is just C dV/dt, and
the Vm here represents

400
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:57,130
the membrane potential, OK?

401
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:00,760
So the capacitive current
through a membrane

402
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:04,120
is just the capacitance
times the time rate of change

403
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,870
of the membrane potential.

404
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:10,038
Any questions?

405
00:20:10,038 --> 00:20:10,970
OK.

406
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:12,930
Pretty straightforward.

407
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:15,440
Now what we're
going to do now is

408
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,610
we're going to relate
the injected charge

409
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:22,730
to the-- sorry, the injected
current to the capacitor.

410
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:25,680
And what does Kirchhoff's
current law tell us?

411
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,970
It tells us that the amount of
current going into this wire

412
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:32,830
has to be equal to the amount
of current leaving that wire.

413
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,330
OK?

414
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,720
So we can write that
down as follows.

415
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,320
The difference in sign here is
because the electrode current

416
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,860
is defined as positive
inward, the capacitive current

417
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:46,968
is defined as positive outward.

418
00:20:46,968 --> 00:20:47,468
OK?

419
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:57,950
So you can see that
we just calculated

420
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:00,110
the capacitive
current, it's C dV/dt,

421
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:02,180
so we can just
plug that in here,

422
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,370
and now we see this
very simple relation

423
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:08,250
between the injected
current and the voltage.

424
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,960
And again, the current
has unit of amperes,

425
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,280
which is coulombs per second.

426
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,110
OK, so we have that.

427
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,940
Now we have a
differential equation

428
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,400
that describes the relation
between current and voltage,

429
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:32,590
we can just integrate
it to get the solution.

430
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,930
So that membrane
potential will just

431
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:39,130
be some initial membrane
potential at time 0

432
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:45,190
plus 1 over C integral over
time of the injected current.

433
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:52,300
Just integrate both sides.

434
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,360
You get V here, you get
integral of I there,

435
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:04,208
and divide both sides
by C. Any questions?

436
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:08,570
It's either really
confusing or really obvious.

437
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:09,070
Yeah?

438
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,730
Everybody OK?

439
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,010
All right, good.

440
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:12,910
Now what is this?

441
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:17,870
What is the integral
of current over time?

442
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,530
AUDIENCE: It's
charge [INAUDIBLE]

443
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:20,280
MICHALE FEE: Good.

444
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,280
It's the amount of charge
you injected between time

445
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,680
0 and time t, right?

446
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:30,750
And what is the amount of charge
you inject-- if I tell you

447
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:35,190
that I injected an amount of
charge delta Q, how much did

448
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,130
I change the voltage?

449
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,960
Delta V is delta Q over
C, and that's exactly.

450
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,870
So the voltage is just
the starting voltage

451
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:51,740
plus delta voltage.

452
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:54,120
Does that makes sense?

453
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,000
This integral here is just--

454
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,430
that part is just
the amount of charge

455
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:03,090
you injected divided by C gives
you the change in the voltage.

456
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:08,340
So the voltage is just the
starting voltage plus delta V,

457
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,550
OK?

458
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,050
Yes?

459
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:11,888
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

460
00:23:11,888 --> 00:23:12,930
MICHALE FEE: What's that?

461
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:13,913
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

462
00:23:13,913 --> 00:23:14,580
MICHALE FEE: Oh.

463
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:20,340
Because this equation
here just came from here.

464
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,850
That was our charge--

465
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:26,130
our relation between charge
balance and voltage difference.

466
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:26,630
Yeah?

467
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,820
If it's not clear, just
please ask, thank you.

468
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,000
OK.

469
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,730
There we go.

470
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:45,040
So what is the
interval constant?

471
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,980
It's just some constant
times time, right?

472
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:51,250
So our voltage is just
some initial voltage

473
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:55,760
plus the injected current
over C times time.

474
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,000
And so you can see where
this comes from, right?

475
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,340
When you turn the
current on, the voltage

476
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:04,150
just increases
linearly over time

477
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:08,590
with a slope that's given
by the current divided

478
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,156
by the capacitance.

479
00:24:10,156 --> 00:24:10,656
OK?

480
00:24:18,782 --> 00:24:22,820
All right, any questions?

481
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,310
You guys are being very quiet.

482
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:27,310
This is the point where
I start feeling nervous,

483
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,310
I went too fast.

484
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,110
Yes?

485
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:31,360
AUDIENCE: You continually
draw the curve for a while--

486
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,068
MICHALE FEE: Yep.

487
00:24:32,068 --> 00:24:34,080
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

488
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,830
MICHALE FEE: Yes, it does.

489
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:42,920
And it breaks at
about a volt or so.

490
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,470
Because the electric
field gets so strong,

491
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:48,560
it literally just
rips the atoms apart

492
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,355
in the molecules of
the lipid bilayer.

493
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:54,450
Yes?

494
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:55,828
AUDIENCE: Why do you [INAUDIBLE]

495
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:57,370
MICHALE FEE: Sorry,
I shouldn't say--

496
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:01,740
it doesn't rip the atoms apart,
it rips the molecules apart.

497
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,650
You need much higher
electric fields to do that.

498
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:05,460
Yes?

499
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:10,728
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

500
00:25:10,728 --> 00:25:11,395
MICHALE FEE: Oh.

501
00:25:11,395 --> 00:25:17,440
Because we're integrating
from time 0 to time t.

502
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,460
We want to know the
voltage at time t, OK?

503
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:24,100
We're starting at 0, we're
integrating the current

504
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:29,660
from time 0 to time t,
which is where we're wanting

505
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,990
to know the voltage, right?

506
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:34,010
So you have to integrate
the current from 0 to t.

507
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:39,340
We can't use t in here.
t is the endpoint.

508
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:39,980
Yeah.

509
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:40,978
Does that makes sense?

510
00:25:40,978 --> 00:25:42,020
Good question, thank you.

511
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,590
OK, everybody all right?

512
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:55,770
I'm going to stand here until
I hear one more question.

513
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:56,270
Yes?

514
00:25:56,270 --> 00:26:00,483
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

515
00:26:00,483 --> 00:26:01,400
MICHALE FEE: Oh, here.

516
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:05,840
Because it's a
current of value I0.

517
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,790
Great question.

518
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:08,290
Yes?

519
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:11,510
AUDIENCE: So to maintain this
constant current [INAUDIBLE]

520
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:15,270
the amount of [INAUDIBLE]
you're pumping it and--

521
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,410
MICHALE FEE: Yes.

522
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:17,040
That's right.

523
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,920
This-- OK, I should have
maybe been more clear.

524
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:24,150
This current source has a
knob on it that I get to set.

525
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:26,670
I get to like--

526
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,140
there would be an
app now, and I'd

527
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,360
pull out my current
source app and I

528
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,938
type in 10 milliamps, boom.

529
00:26:31,938 --> 00:26:34,230
And this thing-- because
there's a Bluetooth connection

530
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:37,410
to this thing, and it like sets
this thing to 10 milliamps,

531
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:39,960
and it just keeps pumping
10 milliamps until you tell

532
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:44,120
it to do something else, OK?

533
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:44,620
Yes?

534
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:47,690
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] make the
right direction instead of it

535
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:50,307
being constant current
state that usually--

536
00:26:50,307 --> 00:26:51,140
MICHALE FEE: Oh, OK.

537
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:54,000
AUDIENCE: --that would
create some weird kind of--

538
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,150
MICHALE FEE: Sure.

539
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:55,650
Yeah.

540
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:56,880
What would that be, actually?

541
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,685
If you put in a linear
ramp in current?

542
00:26:59,685 --> 00:27:02,400
It would be a parabolic
voltage profile.

543
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,600
Yeah, very good.

544
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,830
That's exactly it.

545
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:09,630
This current profile that
you-- this voltage profile

546
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:13,660
is literally just the numerical
integral of this function.

547
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,330
So all you have to
do is look at this

548
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:17,490
and integrate it in
your head, and you can

549
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:20,670
see what the voltage does, OK?

550
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:21,420
Great.

551
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,980
That's exactly right.

552
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,280
So let's do another example.

553
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,280
Let's put in a current pulse.

554
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,160
So we start at zero current,
we step it up to I0,

555
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,580
we hold it there for tau,
then we turn the current off.

556
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,680
So let's start our
neuron right here.

557
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,462
What's going to happen?

558
00:27:36,462 --> 00:27:37,170
What's your name?

559
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:39,420
I'm going to ask you
to do this problem.

560
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,210
What-- yeah.

561
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:40,878
AUDIENCE: Sammy.

562
00:27:40,878 --> 00:27:41,670
MICHALE FEE: Sammy.

563
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:44,448
What's this voltage going to do?

564
00:27:44,448 --> 00:27:45,930
AUDIENCE: So I'd say constant.

565
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:46,680
MICHALE FEE: Good.

566
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,183
Because it's zero current.

567
00:27:48,183 --> 00:27:49,350
Then what's going to happen?

568
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,610
AUDIENCE: And it's
going to [INAUDIBLE]

569
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:51,360
MICHALE FEE: Good.

570
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,130
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

571
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,294
MICHALE FEE: Good.

572
00:27:54,294 --> 00:27:57,655
AUDIENCE: And then the
[INAUDIBLE] go back to constant

573
00:27:57,655 --> 00:27:58,620
at that point.

574
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,700
MICHALE FEE: Awesome.

575
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,370
That's it.

576
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:03,240
It's that simple.

577
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,755
OK?

578
00:28:05,755 --> 00:28:08,550
Good.

579
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,120
All right.

580
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,740
Now somebody brought
up resistors.

581
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,020
Who brought up ion conductances?

582
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,700
Somebody mentioned that.

583
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:19,340
So that's the next thing
we're going to add.

584
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:23,580
This is sort of the zero
order model of a neuron.

585
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:28,040
It has the simplest view and
it's often not so bad, OK?

586
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,000
For short periods of time.

587
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,680
But neurons actually have
ion channels, all right?

588
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,540
Allow current to flow
through the membrane.

589
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,300
So we're going to start
today by analyzing

590
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,880
the case of the simplest
kind of ion channel

591
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,610
which is the kind of ion channel
you get when you take a needle

592
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:47,670
and you poke a hole
in the membrane, OK?

593
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:52,030
It's called the leak
or a hole, all right?

594
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,680
And we're going to analyze
what our neuron does

595
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,410
when you do that.

596
00:28:55,410 --> 00:29:00,490
So what we're going to find
is that the ion channel--

597
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:04,400
a leak conductance, it can
be represented in our model

598
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:09,070
simply by a resistor, OK?

599
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:12,220
And we're going to have our
capacitive current, membrane

600
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:16,300
capacitive current, and a
membrane ionic current that's

601
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:20,700
due to ions flowing through ion
channels in the membrane, OK?

602
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:26,070
And that current will be--

603
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:29,130
we're going to call that
our leak resistance,

604
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:35,730
and that current will
be our leak current, OK?

605
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:38,490
So now, Kirchhoff's
current law tells us what?

606
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:42,060
That the leak current plus
the capacitive current

607
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:45,728
has to equal the injected
current, all right?

608
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:53,860
We know the capacitive
current is just C dV/dt,

609
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:56,140
so we just plug that
in, and now we have I

610
00:29:56,140 --> 00:30:00,160
leak plus C dV/dt equals the
injected electrode current.

611
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:05,880
That is called membrane
ionic current, that

612
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,500
is called membrane
capacitive current,

613
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,230
and that is our
electrode current.

614
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:15,730
There's a sign convention
in neuroscience,

615
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:18,600
which is that membrane
ionic currents that

616
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,850
are outward from the
inside of the cell

617
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:25,410
to the outside of the cell
membrane are positive in sign.

618
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:29,720
Positive charges leaving the
cell have a positive sign.

619
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,010
It's just convention, it
could have been the other way.

620
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:37,130
But you have to choose
something, so that's what--

621
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:39,860
I think it was Hodgkin
and Huxley, actually,

622
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,990
who decided that.

623
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:44,690
Inward currents, positive
charges entering the cell

624
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:47,150
through the membrane going
this way from extracellular

625
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:51,533
to intracellular, are
defined as negative.

626
00:30:51,533 --> 00:30:52,950
Electrode currents,
the other way.

627
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:55,410
Electrode current--
inward current is--

628
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:57,482
into the cell is positive.

629
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,440
OK, so we're going to poke
a hole in our membrane

630
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:08,860
and we're going to model that
ion channel using Ohm's law.

631
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:12,160
So the leak current is just
membrane potential divided

632
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,220
by resistance, leak resistance.

633
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:22,850
So what do we get if
we plug this into our--

634
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:25,050
I leak plus I capacitance?

635
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,570
Capacitive equals
injected current.

636
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:32,640
We get V membrane potential,
Vm over RL plus C dV/dt

637
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,295
equals injected current, OK?

638
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:45,460
We multiply both sides by
resistance, we get V plus RC--

639
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:48,320
that why it's
called an RC model--

640
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,260
dV/dt equals leak
resistance times

641
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:56,360
the injected current, all right?

642
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,740
Now that's looking a
little complicated,

643
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:01,940
but we're going to
simplify things now.

644
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:05,970
Tau-- I'm sorry, RC is
resistance times capacitance,

645
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:09,270
and it turns out, that
has units of time.

646
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:13,110
And so we're going
to call that tau--

647
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,767
got a little ahead of myself.

648
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:16,350
That's called tau,
we're going to make

649
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,920
that substitution in a minute.

650
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,170
But first we're going to
calculate the steady state

651
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:24,050
solution to that
little equation, OK?

652
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:26,537
So bear with me, hang
on, it's all going

653
00:32:26,537 --> 00:32:27,620
to make sense in a minute.

654
00:32:30,947 --> 00:32:33,030
Does anyone know how to
calculate the steady state

655
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:35,650
solution of a
differential equation?

656
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:36,150
Yes?

657
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:37,290
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

658
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:38,040
MICHALE FEE: Good.

659
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,610
What's your name?

660
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:39,360
AUDIENCE: Rebecca.

661
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,910
MICHALE FEE: Rebecca.

662
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:42,870
So you said the derivative--

663
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:44,270
so let's do that.

664
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,850
Set dV/dt equal to 0.

665
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,640
And what do you find?

666
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,490
Sorry, we flashed
the answer up there.

667
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:56,126
What do you get if you
said dV/dt equals 0?

668
00:32:56,126 --> 00:32:57,860
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

669
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:58,790
MICHALE FEE: Good.

670
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:01,690
So you inject some
current, we're

671
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:04,530
going to hold the current
constant, let's say, OK?

672
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:08,720
We've put some current in
and we hold it constant.

673
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,210
The voltage will change,
and eventually things

674
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:15,630
will settle down and
the dV/dt will go to 0.

675
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:18,180
At that point, we
know the voltage.

676
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:21,840
It's just RL times Ie.

677
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,020
What is the voltage equals
resistance times current?

678
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,107
What is that?

679
00:33:26,107 --> 00:33:26,940
AUDIENCE: Ohm's law.

680
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,190
MICHALE FEE: Ohm's law.

681
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:33,790
It's just when we inject
current, a bunch of stuff

682
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:37,720
happens, and when
the dust settles,

683
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,580
the voltage difference is
just the injected current

684
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:45,090
divided by the resistance.

685
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:46,420
Does that makes sense?

686
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:46,920
Yes?

687
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:52,567
AUDIENCE: Where is [INAUDIBLE]

688
00:33:52,567 --> 00:33:54,650
MICHALE FEE: Well, right
now we just took a needle

689
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:57,380
and poked a hole in our cell.

690
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,450
So--

691
00:33:58,450 --> 00:33:59,700
AUDIENCE: How big the hole is?

692
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,490
MICHALE FEE: Yep, exactly.

693
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:03,530
It's how big the hole is.

694
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:07,950
Now cells-- real cells
do have leak channels.

695
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:11,630
They're actually
ion channels that

696
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:14,590
leak kind of any
ion that's in there.

697
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:18,298
It's not very common.

698
00:34:18,298 --> 00:34:19,590
And you'll see why in a minute.

699
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:26,139
Actually, that's not quite true.

700
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:31,080
There are ion channels that
look essentially like leaks,

701
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:35,389
and it turns out
that the ion channels

702
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:39,590
that many neurotransmitter
receptors like

703
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:43,969
glutamate and acetylcholine,
the ion channels actually

704
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:45,350
look like little leaks.

705
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:50,210
They pass multiple ions that
makes them look like leaks.

706
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:56,510
OK.

707
00:34:56,510 --> 00:35:02,210
So in steady state, the membrane
potential goes to RL times Ie,

708
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:06,680
and we call that voltage
something special, V infinity,

709
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:10,940
because it's the voltage that
the system reaches at time

710
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:14,760
equals infinity, OK?

711
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,850
Any questions about that?

712
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:19,070
OK.

713
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:24,650
So we're going to just rewrite
this equation as Vm plus tau

714
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:26,670
dV/dt equals V infinity.

715
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:30,170
And that equation we're
going to see over and over

716
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:34,050
and over again in this class
in many different contexts, all

717
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:34,550
right?

718
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,830
It's a first order linear
differential equation

719
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:42,700
and it's very powerful, so I
want you to get used to it.

720
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:46,100
So what does this mean?

721
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,410
So let's rewrite this
equation a little bit.

722
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:52,060
Let's move this term
to the other side

723
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:55,060
and divide both sides by
tau, and here's what you get.

724
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:59,950
dV/dt equals minus
1 over tau V minus--

725
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:03,835
times V minus V infinity.

726
00:36:03,835 --> 00:36:06,630
OK?

727
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:10,520
Now let's take a look at what
the derivative dV/dt looks

728
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,800
like as a function of voltage.

729
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,300
Yes?

730
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,883
AUDIENCE: So why
couldn't we have said

731
00:36:13,883 --> 00:36:16,260
we didn't mean to [INAUDIBLE].

732
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:25,554
MICHALE FEE: V infinity
is defined as RL times Ie.

733
00:36:25,554 --> 00:36:27,350
AUDIENCE: Oh, so
that's a [INAUDIBLE]..

734
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,760
MICHALE FEE: It's a definition.

735
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,900
Sorry, I should have put
like three lines there

736
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,610
to indicate that
it's the definition.

737
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:34,490
AUDIENCE: OK.

738
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:35,240
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

739
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,690
Sorry, that's a very
important question.

740
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:38,676
What's your name?

741
00:36:38,676 --> 00:36:39,570
AUDIENCE: Rishi.

742
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:40,110
MICHALE FEE: Rishi.

743
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:40,610
OK.

744
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:43,375
I'm going to make an
attempt to remember names.

745
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:48,120
So is everyone clear about that?

746
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:52,420
V infinity is defined
as the resistance

747
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,080
times this injected current.

748
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:58,780
So the injected current, when we
inject current into our neuron,

749
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:02,150
you're changing V infinity, OK?

750
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:04,103
You're controlling it.

751
00:37:04,103 --> 00:37:05,020
Does that makes sense?

752
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:09,190
OK.

753
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:12,038
So let's look at how
the derivative changes

754
00:37:12,038 --> 00:37:13,830
as a function of voltage,
it's very simple.

755
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:14,530
Bear with me.

756
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:17,020
All of this is
going to crystallize

757
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:21,220
in your mind in one beautiful
construct very shortly.

758
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,063
Yes?

759
00:37:22,063 --> 00:37:25,444
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

760
00:37:25,444 --> 00:37:27,560
MICHALE FEE: Yep.

761
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:33,280
Resistance times capacitance
has units time, OK?

762
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,750
And so we call it tau.

763
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:37,720
Tau is just a constant, OK?

764
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,610
So hang on, bear with me.

765
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:44,550
The derivative is a
function of voltage.

766
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:49,850
And at V equals V infinity,
the derivative is 0, right?

767
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:55,530
That's the definition
of the infinity,

768
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:59,576
it's the voltage at which
the derivative is 0.

769
00:37:59,576 --> 00:38:02,390
Yeah?

770
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:09,490
And the voltage is less than
V infinity, the derivative

771
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:13,270
is positive, right?

772
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:15,670
When the voltage is
below the infinity,

773
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,920
the derivative of
voltage is positive.

774
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,820
So what is the voltage doing?

775
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,990
It's approaching V infinity.

776
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:26,090
If the voltage is
above V infinity,

777
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:30,590
voltage greater than V infinity,
the derivative is negative.

778
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,955
So voltage does what?

779
00:38:32,955 --> 00:38:33,830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

780
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:34,870
MICHALE FEE: Yes, but it's--

781
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:35,787
AUDIENCE: Approaches--

782
00:38:35,787 --> 00:38:37,860
MICHALE FEE: It
approaches V infinity.

783
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,860
So no matter where
voltage is, it's

784
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,300
always approaching V infinity.

785
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,910
If it's below V infinity,
the slope is positive,

786
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:45,740
and it approaches V infinity.

787
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:50,000
If it's above V infinity,
the slope is negative,

788
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,240
and it approaches V
infinity from above.

789
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,710
Pretty cool, right?

790
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:59,690
So V is always just
relaxing toward V infinity.

791
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:00,980
And how does it get there?

792
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,630
Does it go linearly?

793
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:04,310
Well, you can see
that the slope--

794
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:06,050
the rate at which
it approaches V

795
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:10,630
infinity is proportional to how
far away it is from V infinity.

796
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:13,970
And so it doesn't just go vroom,
boom, crash into V infinity,

797
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:22,360
it kind of slowly
approaches V infinity, OK?

798
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,890
Anybody know what that
function is called?

799
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:26,890
AUDIENCE: Exponential.

800
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:30,430
MICHALE FEE: It's an
exponential, good.

801
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:36,920
And it approaches with
a timescale of tau.

802
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:40,430
So if tau is small,
it approaches quickly.

803
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:42,600
If tau is long, it
approaches slow.

804
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:47,970
You can see that if tau is
big, the derivatives are small.

805
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:52,004
If tau is small, the derivatives
are bigger, all right?

806
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,735
Any questions about that?

807
00:40:01,735 --> 00:40:02,980
Yes?

808
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:05,211
AUDIENCE: So a
tau usually is a--

809
00:40:05,211 --> 00:40:06,586
MICHALE FEE: Sorry,
say it again?

810
00:40:06,586 --> 00:40:08,290
AUDIENCE: --times
equals to tau--

811
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:08,998
MICHALE FEE: Yes.

812
00:40:08,998 --> 00:40:12,090
AUDIENCE: --is V
infinity plus 1 over e.

813
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:15,646
MICHALE FEE: At time tau, the--

814
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:17,020
AUDIENCE: Times V0.

815
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,520
MICHALE FEE: At time tau--

816
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:22,000
at time 0, the difference
between V infinity-- sorry, V

817
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,330
and V infinity is
V0 minus V infinity.

818
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:27,820
At time tau, that
initial difference

819
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,320
drops by about a third.

820
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,010
AUDIENCE: OK.

821
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:34,220
MICHALE FEE: About 1 over e,
which I think is 2.7-something,

822
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,050
OK?

823
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:37,600
So in 1 tau, this
voltage difference

824
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,250
falls by about a--
drops by about a third.

825
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:43,020
And in another tau, it
drops by another third,

826
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:46,970
it keeps going, OK?

827
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:47,470
All right.

828
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:51,076
So let's just write down
the general solution.

829
00:40:51,076 --> 00:40:53,350
The general solution
for the case

830
00:40:53,350 --> 00:41:02,700
where you have constant
current, that voltage difference

831
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,370
from the voltage at
time t to V infinity

832
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:08,140
is just equal to the initial
voltage difference times e

833
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:11,775
to the minus t over tau, OK?

834
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:19,950
So if t is equal to tau, then
this is e to the minus 1,

835
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:23,730
so the voltage difference will
be 1/3 of the original voltage

836
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:24,630
difference.

837
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:27,290
Is that clear?

838
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:27,790
OK.

839
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:31,930
So now let's see what this
looks like in our neuron.

840
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:34,320
We have our neuron, we
have a current pulse,

841
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,260
we have zero current,
we turn the current

842
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:40,970
on to I0 at this time, we
hold the current constant,

843
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:45,660
and we turn current off at
this time right here, OK?

844
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:48,480
So what does the voltage do?

845
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,580
Let's go step by step.

846
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,470
The first thing
is that voltage--

847
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:55,995
sorry-- the current controls
what in that equation?

848
00:41:58,902 --> 00:42:03,070
The current controls V infinity.

849
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:05,100
So we can plot V
infinity immediately,

850
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,440
because V infinity is
just the resistance

851
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,800
times the injected current.

852
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,220
So what does V
infinity look like?

853
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:16,908
It's constant here, and then
what happens to V infinity?

854
00:42:16,908 --> 00:42:19,540
AUDIENCE: Increases.

855
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,948
MICHALE FEE: It increases,
that's correct, but--

856
00:42:21,948 --> 00:42:23,490
AUDIENCE: It'll
just be [INAUDIBLE]..

857
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:24,240
MICHALE FEE: Good.

858
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,320
It will just be the
resistance times the current.

859
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:30,886
Resistance is a constant, so V
infinity will just go up here,

860
00:42:30,886 --> 00:42:31,386
right?

861
00:42:31,386 --> 00:42:31,886
Good.

862
00:42:31,886 --> 00:42:39,300
It'll go up, and then it
stays constant at R times I.

863
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:42,050
And then at this
point, the current

864
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:47,420
goes back to 0, so V infinity
is resistance time 0,

865
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:51,300
so V infinity drops back to 0.

866
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,720
Does that makes sense?

867
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:57,160
That's V infinity, that's
not the voltage of the cell.

868
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,880
That's the steady state
voltage of the cell.

869
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,770
So now what does voltage
of the cell actually do?

870
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:11,338
So let's start our
voltage here at 0.

871
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:11,880
What happens?

872
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:16,740
Good.

873
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,470
What is it doing?

874
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:19,970
AUDIENCE: Approaching
from infinity.

875
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:20,750
MICHALE FEE: Good.

876
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:21,960
It approaches.

877
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:27,650
So V at every point
is relaxing toward V

878
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:31,290
infinity exponentially, right?

879
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:32,370
And that looks like--

880
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:39,680
at some time constant, and that
looks like this, all right?

881
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,185
Now what happens here?

882
00:43:42,185 --> 00:43:43,160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

883
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:43,910
MICHALE FEE: Good.

884
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:47,180
Because V infinity
suddenly change to 0,

885
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:50,570
and so V relaxes toward
V infinity exponentially

886
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:52,130
with some time constant.

887
00:43:57,366 --> 00:43:57,866
OK?

888
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:02,397
Any questions?

889
00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:08,370
OK.

890
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:18,690
Now this-- that is our
RC model neuron, OK?

891
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:20,320
Resistance times
capacitance-- they

892
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:24,380
got a resistor and a
capacitor, but the solutions

893
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:27,740
are just exponential decays
toward some steady state

894
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:30,490
solution.

895
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:35,110
Now it turns out
that an RC system,

896
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:40,650
a first order linear system
acts like a filter, OK?

897
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:45,510
So remember, our neuron
that just has a capacitor

898
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:48,660
is an integrator, it
integrates over time.

899
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:51,960
When you add a
resistor, this thing--

900
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,210
it's kind of integrating
here, but then it

901
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:57,630
gets tired and stops
integrating, OK?

902
00:44:57,630 --> 00:45:01,860
It relaxes to some steady state.

903
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:05,750
So this actually
looks like a filter.

904
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:09,820
It takes time to
respond to something.

905
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:15,550
So that system responds well to
things that are changing slowly

906
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:19,150
in time, and it responds
very weakly to things that

907
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:21,410
are changing rapidly in time.

908
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:22,570
So here's an example--

909
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:26,350
I'll put together
this demonstration.

910
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:28,280
In red is the injected current.

911
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:32,050
So if you have long pulses
of injected current,

912
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:35,290
the time constant of this
garners about 10 milliseconds--

913
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:36,930
I think this is probably a--

914
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:39,750
what is that, a 50 or
100-millisecond pulse?

915
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:40,250
80--

916
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:41,125
AUDIENCE: Nanofarads.

917
00:45:41,125 --> 00:45:42,225
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

918
00:45:42,225 --> 00:45:44,390
You can see that in
blue is the voltage,

919
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:47,670
it relaxes toward V infinity.

920
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:50,000
And then the current goes
off, it relaxes back.

921
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,510
And you can see that the
voltage is responding very well

922
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:55,220
to the current injection.

923
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:58,420
But now let's make
really short pulses

924
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:00,760
that are much shorter than tau.

925
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,630
You can see that
the voltage starts

926
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:07,027
relaxing toward V infinity,
but it doesn't get very far,

927
00:46:07,027 --> 00:46:08,860
and all of a sudden the
current's turned off

928
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:10,540
and it relaxes back.

929
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:13,450
And so you can plot the
peak voltage response

930
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:16,220
as a function of the
width of these pulses,

931
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:20,650
and you can see that for long
pulses, it responds very well,

932
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:22,520
but for short pulses--

933
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,310
really responds at all.

934
00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:28,180
And that's called a
low pass filter, OK?

935
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:31,840
It responds well to
slowly-changing things,

936
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:35,210
but barely responds to
rapidly-changing things.

937
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:40,651
So it's passing low frequencies,
low pass filter, OK?

938
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:44,070
All right.

939
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:44,760
Any questions?

940
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,540
That was a lot of
stuff all at once.

941
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:47,040
Yes?

942
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,900
AUDIENCE: I'm just curious,
like on what order is

943
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:53,030
the capacitance for nanofarads?

944
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:54,100
MICHALE FEE: OK.

945
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:57,760
It's 10 nanofarads per--

946
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,990
1 microfarads per
square centimeter.

947
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:03,953
10 nanofarads per
square millimeter, OK?

948
00:47:03,953 --> 00:47:05,870
We're going to get to
that in a second, that's

949
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:07,110
a great question.

950
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:09,950
We're going to get to what
the actual numbers look like

951
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:13,190
for real neurons, OK?

952
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:14,640
I think you had a question.

953
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,095
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

954
00:47:17,095 --> 00:47:18,470
MICHALE FEE: Sorry,
say it again?

955
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:19,870
AUDIENCE: Past [INAUDIBLE]?

956
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:22,795
Is that [INAUDIBLE]
reacts to [INAUDIBLE]??

957
00:47:22,795 --> 00:47:24,670
MICHALE FEE: What happens
is it reacts to it,

958
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:27,640
but because it's
changing kind of linearly

959
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,220
at these short times,
it doesn't get very far.

960
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:32,060
If the current stays
on for a long time,

961
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:35,290
you can see it has exactly
the same profile here,

962
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:37,802
but it just has time
to reach V infinity.

963
00:47:37,802 --> 00:47:39,760
Here, it doesn't have
time to reach V infinity,

964
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:46,590
it just gets a little bit away
from 0 and then it decays back.

965
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:47,350
Yes?

966
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:50,162
AUDIENCE: Are there other sorts
of filters for non-responses

967
00:47:50,162 --> 00:47:52,930
like [INAUDIBLE]?

968
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:55,690
MICHALE FEE: You can build
different kinds of filters

969
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:58,990
from circuits of neurons,
but neurons themselves

970
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:03,160
tend to be high pass filters.

971
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,360
You can-- sorry,
low pass filters.

972
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:10,840
You can make-- so you can put in
different kinds of ion channels

973
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:14,080
that change the
properties of neurons,

974
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,180
but sort of to first
order, you should think

975
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:18,040
of neurons as low pass filters.

976
00:48:21,976 --> 00:48:22,960
Yeah?

977
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:31,282
AUDIENCE: Can you
show the [INAUDIBLE]

978
00:48:31,282 --> 00:48:32,740
MICHALE FEE: I
wrote it like this--

979
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:35,980
you can write it as V equals V
infinity plus this other stuff,

980
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:38,620
but I wrote it like this because
what you should really be

981
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:42,610
seeing here is that the
voltage difference from--

982
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:48,230
time between the voltage and V
infinity decays exponentially.

983
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:51,370
So the distance you are
from V infinity decays

984
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:53,974
exponentially, OK?

985
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,380
It makes it more
obvious that you're

986
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:02,915
decaying toward V infinity, OK?

987
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:07,950
Yes?

988
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:10,492
AUDIENCE: If you were to arrange
like the physical properties

989
00:49:10,492 --> 00:49:15,870
of the neuron itself,
you [INAUDIBLE]

990
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:17,400
MICHALE FEE: Not-- not really.

991
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,420
Not simply.

992
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:22,050
You can put in
certain ion channels

993
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:29,950
that could make a neuron less
responsive at low frequencies,

994
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:30,450
OK?

995
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:34,620
So you can make them kind of
responsive to some middle range

996
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:37,265
of frequencies
that won't respond

997
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:38,640
to very high
frequencies and they

998
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:43,040
won't respond much to
very low frequencies,

999
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,080
but for the most
part, again, just

1000
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,330
you should-- at this point,
let's just think of them

1001
00:49:47,330 --> 00:49:50,210
as low pass filters.

1002
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:52,940
We're going to start
adding fancy stuff

1003
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:58,110
to our neuron that's going
to make it more complicated.

1004
00:49:58,110 --> 00:50:01,070
So don't get too
hung up on this.

1005
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:03,994
All right, let me
just make this point.

1006
00:50:03,994 --> 00:50:07,630
This one right
here, V equals tau--

1007
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:11,660
V plus tau dV/dt equals V
infinity appears everywhere,

1008
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:17,920
it's ubiquitous in physics,
chemistry, biology, we'll

1009
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,380
be using it in multiple
different contexts

1010
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:24,790
in different parts of
the class, and in--

1011
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:26,920
computation, OK?

1012
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:32,770
And even slightly more
complicated versions of this,

1013
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:37,500
like the Michaelis-Menten
equations in chemistry,

1014
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,880
you can kind of understand
them in simple terms.

1015
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:43,290
If you like have
a handle on this,

1016
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:45,270
other slightly more
complicated things

1017
00:50:45,270 --> 00:50:49,360
become much more intuitive, OK?

1018
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:53,260
All right, so try
to really make sure

1019
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:57,250
that you understand
this equation

1020
00:50:57,250 --> 00:51:02,250
and how we derived it, OK?

1021
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:05,040
OK, let's talk about
the origin of this--

1022
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,510
the timescale of a neuron.

1023
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:08,370
So the tau of a neuron--

1024
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:11,460
of most neurons is about
100 milliseconds to--

1025
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:13,650
sorry, 10 milliseconds
to 100 milliseconds,

1026
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:15,250
kind of in that range.

1027
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:18,600
And it comes from the values
of resistance and capacitance

1028
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:19,990
of a neuron.

1029
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:24,660
So a resistor-- the
resistance of a neuron--

1030
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:29,770
range of 100 million ohms, OK?

1031
00:51:29,770 --> 00:51:33,510
And the capacitance is about
10 to the minus 10 ohms

1032
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:37,640
or about 100 picofarads.

1033
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,780
And you multiply those
two things together

1034
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:44,910
and you get a time constant
of about 10 milliseconds, OK?

1035
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:49,510
So what that means is if you
inject current into a neuron,

1036
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:52,420
it takes about 10 to
100 milliseconds for it

1037
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:58,010
to fully respond to
that step of current.

1038
00:51:58,010 --> 00:52:00,260
The voltage will
jump up and relax

1039
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:05,510
to the new V infinity in about
10 to 100 milliseconds, OK?

1040
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:07,190
So let's take a
little bit closer

1041
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:11,000
look at the resistance-- what
this resistance in capacitance

1042
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,420
looks like in a neuron.

1043
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:18,700
So we've described the
relation between leak current

1044
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:24,850
and voltage as current equals
voltage over resistance,

1045
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:29,810
but rather than using resistance
to think about currents flowing

1046
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:33,290
through a membrane, it's
much more useful, usually,

1047
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:35,730
to think about something
called conductance,

1048
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:39,550
and conductance is just
1 over resistance, OK?

1049
00:52:39,550 --> 00:52:43,790
So conductance, G-- and we use
the simple G for conductance--

1050
00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:45,620
it's equal to 1 over resistance.

1051
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,960
So now we can write
Ohm's law as I

1052
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:55,820
equals G times V. Resistance
has units of ohms, G--

1053
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:58,730
conductance has units of
inverse ohms or siemens

1054
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:02,930
is the SI unit for conductance.

1055
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:06,340
So if we have
conductances, if we

1056
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:10,400
have two-- let's say two ion
channels in the membrane,

1057
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,830
they operate in parallel.

1058
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:15,125
Current flows through
them separately, right?

1059
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:17,500
They're not in series, like
it flows through one and then

1060
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,070
flows through the other, right?

1061
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:22,150
They are in parallel--
the current can flow

1062
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:26,210
through both like
this up in parallel.

1063
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:30,160
And we can write down the
current using Kirchhoff's law,

1064
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,200
the total current
is just the sum

1065
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:36,130
of the current through those two
separate conductances, right?

1066
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:38,140
Now the total current is--

1067
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:40,840
we can just expand this
in terms of the inductance

1068
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:41,750
of each one of those.

1069
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:47,560
So the total current is G1
times the voltage difference

1070
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:50,680
plus G2 times the
voltage difference

1071
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:53,610
for this conductance.

1072
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:55,490
So the total current is just--

1073
00:53:55,490 --> 00:53:59,720
you factor out the V, the total
current is just G1 plus G2,

1074
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:05,910
so we can write down the total
conductance as just G1 plus G2.

1075
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:07,290
Does that makes sense?

1076
00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:10,230
So conductances in
parallel add together.

1077
00:54:13,563 --> 00:54:15,230
So if we have a piece
of membrane that's

1078
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:18,860
got some ion channels
in it-- or holes,

1079
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:21,080
and we add another piece of
membrane that kind of has

1080
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:23,440
the same density
of ion channels,

1081
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,080
you have twice the
holes, twice the current,

1082
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,500
and twice the conductance.

1083
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:36,400
So we can write the current
as conductance times membrane

1084
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:39,010
potential, but we can
rewrite that conductance

1085
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:43,680
as the area times that
conductance per unit area,

1086
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:47,200
and that's called specific
membrane conductance--

1087
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,540
in this case, it's a leak,
so we call it specific leak

1088
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:53,980
conductance, and it has units
of conductance per area.

1089
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:03,070
We multiply that by the area and
we get that total conductance.

1090
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:04,330
Any questions about this?

1091
00:55:09,077 --> 00:55:09,577
No?

1092
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:17,190
So you can see that
we can now plot

1093
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:21,940
the current through the membrane
as a function of voltage.

1094
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:25,080
This is called a
IV current plotted

1095
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,170
as a function of voltage.

1096
00:55:26,170 --> 00:55:28,877
You can see that the
current is linear

1097
00:55:28,877 --> 00:55:30,210
as a function of voltage, right?

1098
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:33,230
That's just Ohm's law.

1099
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:36,180
And you can see that for a
low conductance, G is small,

1100
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:38,380
so the slope is small.

1101
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:40,760
For a high conductance,
you get a lot

1102
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:43,460
of current for a little bit
of voltage, and so the--

1103
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:45,070
deeper, OK?

1104
00:55:45,070 --> 00:55:48,580
So if you plot current versus
voltage, you get a curve,

1105
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:54,414
and the slope of that curve is
just equal to the conductance,

1106
00:55:54,414 --> 00:55:56,800
all right?

1107
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:57,340
OK.

1108
00:55:57,340 --> 00:56:00,200
Now let's look at capacitance.

1109
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:04,600
The total current through these
two capacitors in parallel

1110
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:07,140
is just the current through
one capacitor plus the current

1111
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:08,160
through the other.

1112
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,800
We can write the current through
each capacitor separately.

1113
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:16,080
I total equals C1
dV/dt plus C2 dV/dt.

1114
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:19,050
Factor out the dV/dt and you get
that the total current is just

1115
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:21,320
C1 plus C2 dV/dt.

1116
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:25,410
So the total capacitance is
the sum of the capacitances.

1117
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:27,570
So if you have a
patch of membrane,

1118
00:56:27,570 --> 00:56:31,090
you measure the capacitance, if
you put another one next to it,

1119
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:33,820
you'll get the sum of
those two capacitances.

1120
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:36,675
So the capacitance
also scales with area.

1121
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:42,590
So we can write down the
total membrane capacitance

1122
00:56:42,590 --> 00:56:48,500
as capacitance per unit area
times the area of the cell,

1123
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,380
right?

1124
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:53,650
And the area of a cell is
like the-- if it's a sphere,

1125
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:59,020
it's 4 pi r squared
where is the radius, OK?

1126
00:56:59,020 --> 00:56:59,520
All right.

1127
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,760
And here's the-- this
C sub m is called

1128
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:05,580
this specific
membrane capacitance,

1129
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:11,580
and it's 10 nanofarads per
square millimeter, all right?

1130
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:14,860
OK, now, I want to show
you something really cool.

1131
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:18,450
We have a cell that has
a membrane with some--

1132
00:57:18,450 --> 00:57:20,400
this cell has some time
constant-- remember,

1133
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,390
10 milliseconds.

1134
00:57:22,390 --> 00:57:26,280
Now you might think,
oh, the capacitance

1135
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:29,160
of the cell depends on
how big it is, right?

1136
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,140
And so the time
constant will change

1137
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:34,650
depending on how big the
cell is, you might think.

1138
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:36,240
But let's actually
calculate the time

1139
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:41,230
constant from this capacitance
and this conductance, OK?

1140
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:42,310
So here we go.

1141
00:57:42,310 --> 00:57:48,730
Time constant C. R is just 1
over the conductance, right?

1142
00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:50,500
So the time constant
is capacitance

1143
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,990
divided by conductance--
total capacitance

1144
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:55,900
divided by total conductance.

1145
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:58,860
But you can rewrite this
capacitance as capacitance

1146
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:01,140
per unit area
times area, you can

1147
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:04,950
rewrite that conductance
as conductance per unit

1148
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:10,630
area times the area of the
cell, and the areas cancel.

1149
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:14,590
And so the time constant
is just that capacitance

1150
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:17,770
per unit area of the membrane
divided by the conductance

1151
00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:19,880
per unit area of the membrane.

1152
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:23,470
And what that means is that
the time constant of a cell--

1153
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:25,380
nothing to do with the cell.

1154
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:28,870
The time constant is the
membrane time constant,

1155
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:31,165
and it's a property
only of the membrane.

1156
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:35,270
That's pretty cool, right?

1157
00:58:43,126 --> 00:58:44,580
Any questions about that?

1158
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:56,420
Now in a more
complicated neuron where

1159
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:59,480
you have a soma and
dendrites and axons,

1160
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:05,310
different parts of the cell
can have different conductance

1161
00:59:05,310 --> 00:59:07,560
per unit area-- like
more ion channels

1162
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:11,010
out here on the dendrite
and maybe fewer on the soma.

1163
00:59:11,010 --> 00:59:14,700
And so one part of a cell can
have a different membrane time

1164
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:18,870
constant than some other
part of the cell, OK?

1165
00:59:18,870 --> 00:59:20,880
But again, it's a
property of the membrane.

1166
00:59:27,478 --> 00:59:28,520
Any questions about that?

1167
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:29,294
Yes?

1168
00:59:29,294 --> 00:59:32,305
AUDIENCE: So in that case,
like different time constants,

1169
00:59:32,305 --> 00:59:35,150
do you have to like consider
flow between different areas?

1170
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:36,580
MICHALE FEE: You sure do.

1171
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:37,490
Absolutely.

1172
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:41,660
That's one of the
interesting things about--

1173
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:43,442
when cells have multiple--

1174
00:59:43,442 --> 00:59:44,900
they have different
properties, you

1175
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:46,940
have current flowing
between them,

1176
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:50,390
but you have to understand
this kind of basic stuff

1177
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:53,300
before you even get anywhere
close to understanding a more

1178
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:55,240
complicated neuron, right?

1179
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:00,630
OK.

1180
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:04,555
So we're going to add a
new component to our model.

1181
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:12,080
It's a battery, and it's
going to solve one really

1182
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:15,050
fatal problem with this model.

1183
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:17,990
What's the problem
with this model?

1184
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:18,790
Can anyone see--

1185
01:00:18,790 --> 01:00:20,570
I'm kind of showing
it right here.

1186
01:00:25,370 --> 01:00:30,280
What happens to this neuron
if I turn the current off?

1187
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:31,330
It goes back to zero.

1188
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,790
And in order to get the voltage
to go different from zero,

1189
01:00:38,790 --> 01:00:43,460
I have to inject current
through my current source.

1190
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:46,850
Without me, the experimenter
with an electrode in it

1191
01:00:46,850 --> 01:00:50,120
injecting current, this neuron
literally just sits at zero

1192
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:53,210
and stays there, all right?

1193
01:00:53,210 --> 01:00:56,170
It's actually a good model
of a dead neuron, OK?

1194
01:00:59,170 --> 01:01:04,345
So in order to change that, we
need to add a battery here, OK?

1195
01:01:08,150 --> 01:01:11,270
And that battery is going
to power this thing up,

1196
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:13,710
so now it can change
its own voltage.

1197
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:19,230
And then things start
getting really interesting.

1198
01:01:19,230 --> 01:01:21,870
So how can these
batteries allow a neuron

1199
01:01:21,870 --> 01:01:23,950
to change its own voltage?

1200
01:01:23,950 --> 01:01:28,500
Well, the way a neuron controls
its own voltage is it has ion

1201
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:30,720
channels-- conductances--

1202
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,720
that have little knobs
on them that the cell

1203
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:39,140
can control called voltage.

1204
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:42,320
So these conductances
are voltage-dependent,

1205
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:45,200
and now the cell
connects these batteries

1206
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:51,170
to its inside wire at different
times in different ways.

1207
01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:53,600
So let's say we want to
make an action potential.

1208
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:56,380
So we have a battery that's
got a positive voltage,

1209
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:58,990
we have a battery that's
got a negative voltage,

1210
01:01:58,990 --> 01:02:03,760
and we make an action potential
by connecting the back

1211
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:08,080
to the inside of the cell by
turning on this conductance,

1212
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:10,930
and then we're going
to connect the battery

1213
01:02:10,930 --> 01:02:13,120
with a negative
voltage to our cell,

1214
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:15,520
and we're going to do
that one after the other.

1215
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:17,140
So watch this.

1216
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:21,880
We're going to connect
the positive battery

1217
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:23,885
and the voltage
is going to go up;

1218
01:02:23,885 --> 01:02:25,760
we're going to turn off
the positive battery,

1219
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:29,050
connect the negative battery,
the voltage goes down;

1220
01:02:29,050 --> 01:02:32,070
and then we're going to
turn off both batteries,

1221
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:36,610
and the voltage
just relaxes, OK?

1222
01:02:36,610 --> 01:02:37,800
Cool, right?

1223
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:42,180
So now the neuron can
control its own voltage.

1224
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:46,914
But before we do that, we need
to put batteries in our neuron,

1225
01:02:46,914 --> 01:02:48,950
OK?

1226
01:02:48,950 --> 01:02:49,450
All right.

1227
01:02:49,450 --> 01:02:52,656
So anybody know what the-- yes?

1228
01:02:52,656 --> 01:03:00,508
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
What does that [INAUDIBLE]

1229
01:03:00,508 --> 01:03:02,425
MICHALE FEE: Good, we're
going to get to that.

1230
01:03:02,425 --> 01:03:05,000
That was-- exact next question.

1231
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,546
What is it that makes
a battery in a neuron?

1232
01:03:08,546 --> 01:03:09,480
Yeah?

1233
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:12,444
AUDIENCE: Well I mean, like,
you have like something, right?

1234
01:03:12,444 --> 01:03:13,230
Even in like--

1235
01:03:13,230 --> 01:03:13,520
MICHALE FEE: Good.

1236
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:14,680
AUDIENCE: --concentration
gradient--

1237
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:15,430
MICHALE FEE: Good.

1238
01:03:15,430 --> 01:03:17,470
AUDIENCE: --so that
give us a [INAUDIBLE]

1239
01:03:17,470 --> 01:03:18,220
MICHALE FEE: Here.

1240
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:20,710
You give the rest
of the lecture.

1241
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:22,600
That's exactly right.

1242
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:23,140
OK?

1243
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:25,760
Well concentration gradients.

1244
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:28,270
There's one more thing we need.

1245
01:03:28,270 --> 01:03:31,330
Concentration gradients
by themselves don't do it.

1246
01:03:31,330 --> 01:03:36,200
We need ion channels that are
permeable only to certain ions,

1247
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:36,700
OK?

1248
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:38,283
And that's what we're
going to do now.

1249
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:42,870
So you need
concentration gradients

1250
01:03:42,870 --> 01:03:45,360
and ion-selective
permeability, OK?

1251
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:48,370
So we're going to
go through that.

1252
01:03:48,370 --> 01:03:51,870
So let's take a beaker,
fill it with water,

1253
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:54,570
have a membrane,
dividing it into two.

1254
01:03:54,570 --> 01:03:56,670
We're going to have an
electrode on one side,

1255
01:03:56,670 --> 01:03:58,830
we measure the voltage
difference-- sorry,

1256
01:03:58,830 --> 01:04:00,270
we have an electron
on both sides,

1257
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:02,310
we hook it up to our
differential amplifier,

1258
01:04:02,310 --> 01:04:05,100
and measure the voltage
difference on the two sides,

1259
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:06,390
OK?

1260
01:04:06,390 --> 01:04:09,745
Then we're going to put--

1261
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:14,580
we're going to take a--

1262
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:18,820
we're going to buy some
potassium chloride from sigma,

1263
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:20,400
we're going to take
a spoonful of it

1264
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:23,460
and dump it into this
side of the beaker.

1265
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:27,630
Stir it up, and now you're going
to have lots of potassium ions

1266
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:29,980
and chloride ions on this
side of the beaker, right?

1267
01:04:32,850 --> 01:04:35,550
Now we're going to
take a needle and poke

1268
01:04:35,550 --> 01:04:37,660
a hole in that membrane.

1269
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:41,460
That becomes a leak,
a leak channel.

1270
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:44,940
It's a non-specific--
a non-selective pore

1271
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:49,107
that passes any iron, OK?

1272
01:04:49,107 --> 01:04:50,190
So what's going to happen?

1273
01:04:54,375 --> 01:04:56,710
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1274
01:04:56,710 --> 01:04:57,490
MICHALE FEE: Good.

1275
01:04:57,490 --> 01:04:59,697
The ions are going to diffuse.

1276
01:04:59,697 --> 01:05:00,530
From where to where?

1277
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:01,670
Somebody else.

1278
01:05:01,670 --> 01:05:03,470
AUDIENCE: To the
lower concentration.

1279
01:05:03,470 --> 01:05:05,387
MICHALE FEE: To the lower
concentration, good.

1280
01:05:05,387 --> 01:05:08,230
So some of those ions are going
to diffuse from here to here.

1281
01:05:08,230 --> 01:05:12,132
And we can plot the potassium--
let's focus on potassium now.

1282
01:05:12,132 --> 01:05:14,090
We're going to plot-- we
can plot the potassium

1283
01:05:14,090 --> 01:05:16,710
concentration on
this side over time

1284
01:05:16,710 --> 01:05:18,620
and on this side over time.

1285
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:21,530
By the way, this
side of the beaker

1286
01:05:21,530 --> 01:05:23,900
is going to represent the
inside of the neuron, which

1287
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:25,910
has lots of
potassium, and this is

1288
01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:28,250
going to represent the
outside of our neuron, which

1289
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:31,340
has very little potassium, OK?

1290
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:35,280
So if we plot that potassium
concentration on this side,

1291
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:37,160
it's going to
increase over time.

1292
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:38,480
It's going to take a long--

1293
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,610
and the concentration
here will decrease

1294
01:05:40,610 --> 01:05:44,240
and eventually they'll meet
in the middle somewhere.

1295
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:47,245
They'll become equal.

1296
01:05:47,245 --> 01:05:49,370
And that's going to take
a really long time, right?

1297
01:05:49,370 --> 01:05:51,950
Because it takes a
long time for this half

1298
01:05:51,950 --> 01:05:53,810
of this spoonful of
potassium chloride

1299
01:05:53,810 --> 01:05:56,196
to diffuse to the other side.

1300
01:05:56,196 --> 01:05:59,070
Yeah?

1301
01:05:59,070 --> 01:06:01,800
OK.

1302
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:06,590
Now let's get a
different kind of needle,

1303
01:06:06,590 --> 01:06:08,060
a very special needle.

1304
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:11,210
It's really small
and poke a hole

1305
01:06:11,210 --> 01:06:13,850
in the membrane that
is only big enough

1306
01:06:13,850 --> 01:06:16,760
to pass potassium ions
but not chloride ions.

1307
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:20,930
So what's going to happen now?

1308
01:06:26,490 --> 01:06:26,990
Yeah?

1309
01:06:26,990 --> 01:06:30,920
Somebody-- yes?

1310
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:33,280
AUDIENCE: Half of it
flows to the other side--

1311
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:34,030
MICHALE FEE: Good.

1312
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:37,640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1313
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:39,080
MICHALE FEE: Good.

1314
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:45,140
So some potassium ions are going
to diffuse through this pore

1315
01:06:45,140 --> 01:06:48,460
and go to the other side.

1316
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:50,770
And what's going to happen
is if we plot the potassium

1317
01:06:50,770 --> 01:06:53,950
concentration here, it
will decrease-- sorry--

1318
01:06:53,950 --> 01:06:56,380
over here it will
increase a little bit,

1319
01:06:56,380 --> 01:06:58,420
and the potassium
concentration on this side

1320
01:06:58,420 --> 01:07:01,870
will decrease a little bit,
but then it will stop changing,

1321
01:07:01,870 --> 01:07:05,690
and it will never
come to equilibrium.

1322
01:07:05,690 --> 01:07:08,650
It will also take a very short
time for that equilibrium

1323
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:10,510
to happen, because
just a few potassium

1324
01:07:10,510 --> 01:07:14,880
ions need to go to the
other side before it stops.

1325
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:18,360
So why does the concentration
stop changing here?

1326
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:21,390
Well, it's because
the potassium current

1327
01:07:21,390 --> 01:07:24,320
from this side to this
side goes to zero,

1328
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:25,695
and it goes to
zero very quickly.

1329
01:07:31,070 --> 01:07:31,880
So why is that?

1330
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:41,390
Well, one hint to the
answer to that question

1331
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:44,300
comes if we look at the voltage
difference between the two

1332
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:44,800
sides.

1333
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:48,020
So what you see is that the
voltage difference started

1334
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:54,250
at 0, and when we poked
that hole, all of a sudden

1335
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:56,920
there was a rapidly-developing
voltage difference

1336
01:07:56,920 --> 01:08:00,470
across the two sides, OK?

1337
01:08:04,210 --> 01:08:08,350
Why does that
voltage go negative?

1338
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:10,800
Anybody?

1339
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:13,940
What happened when these
positive charges started

1340
01:08:13,940 --> 01:08:18,115
diffusing from this
side to this side?

1341
01:08:18,115 --> 01:08:19,615
AUDIENCE: Didn't
you say it can bond

1342
01:08:19,615 --> 01:08:24,479
to the positive and
negative charge [INAUDIBLE]

1343
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:26,939
MICHALE FEE: Basically this
is like a capacitor, right?

1344
01:08:26,939 --> 01:08:30,930
And some charges diffused
from here to here,

1345
01:08:30,930 --> 01:08:33,779
some positive charges
diffused from here to here,

1346
01:08:33,779 --> 01:08:37,649
that charges up this side, and
so the voltage is positive.

1347
01:08:37,649 --> 01:08:40,200
We put positive charge--
more positive charges here,

1348
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:43,915
the voltage here goes up, OK?

1349
01:08:47,310 --> 01:08:54,529
So if the voltage here is
higher than the voltage here--

1350
01:08:54,529 --> 01:08:58,130
we're plotting V1 minus
V2, the voltage here

1351
01:08:58,130 --> 01:09:02,420
is lower than the
voltage here, and so this

1352
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:05,789
is going negative, OK?

1353
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:13,090
And that voltage difference,
that negative voltage here,

1354
01:09:13,090 --> 01:09:16,880
positive voltage here,
what does that do?

1355
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:19,850
It repels, it makes--
the positive side

1356
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:23,100
starts repelling which ions?

1357
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:25,609
It's repelling positive ions.

1358
01:09:25,609 --> 01:09:29,840
So it keeps more potassium
ions from diffusing

1359
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:32,663
through the hole.

1360
01:09:32,663 --> 01:09:33,580
Does that makes sense?

1361
01:09:43,830 --> 01:09:45,240
Blank stares.

1362
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:46,810
Are we OK?

1363
01:09:46,810 --> 01:09:48,710
OK, good.

1364
01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:53,569
And it continues to drop until
it reaches a constant voltage,

1365
01:09:53,569 --> 01:09:56,045
and that's called the
equilibrium potential, OK?

1366
01:09:56,045 --> 01:09:59,120
The voltage changes until
it comes to equilibrium,

1367
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:01,760
and that voltage difference
is called the equilibrium

1368
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:04,160
potential.

1369
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:10,660
And that voltage difference
is a battery, OK?

1370
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:11,500
And I'm going to--

1371
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:13,930
we're going to
explain a little bit--

1372
01:10:13,930 --> 01:10:16,690
I think it's in the next
lecture, the one that's

1373
01:10:16,690 --> 01:10:20,860
on tape that explains how
you actually can justify

1374
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:22,810
representing that as a battery.

1375
01:10:22,810 --> 01:10:25,210
But right now, I'm
going to show you

1376
01:10:25,210 --> 01:10:28,810
how to calculate what that
voltage difference actually

1377
01:10:28,810 --> 01:10:30,910
is-- what's the size
of the battery, how

1378
01:10:30,910 --> 01:10:34,400
big is the battery, OK?

1379
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:37,070
So you can see that when ions--

1380
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:39,950
positive ions defuse to this
side, this voltage goes up,

1381
01:10:39,950 --> 01:10:44,210
you have a voltage gradient that
corresponds to a field pointing

1382
01:10:44,210 --> 01:10:46,460
in this direction.

1383
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:50,160
And that electric field pushes
against the ions-- remember,

1384
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:52,560
we talked about drift
in an electric field,

1385
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:55,130
so when those ions are
trying to diffuse across,

1386
01:10:55,130 --> 01:10:59,000
that electric field is
literally dragging them back

1387
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:04,160
to this side, right?

1388
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:08,480
So we have a current flowing
this way from diffusion,

1389
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:11,990
and we have a current
flowing that way from being

1390
01:11:11,990 --> 01:11:13,410
dragged in the electric field.

1391
01:11:13,410 --> 01:11:19,600
And so we can calculate that
voltage difference because

1392
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:22,900
at equilibrium, the current
flowing this way from diffusion

1393
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:28,850
has to equal the current
flowing that way from drift

1394
01:11:28,850 --> 01:11:30,260
in an electric field, OK?

1395
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:34,040
So one way to
calculate this is we're

1396
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:37,490
going to calculate the
current due to drift,

1397
01:11:37,490 --> 01:11:39,600
current due to
diffusion, add those up,

1398
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:42,470
and that's equal to the
total, and at equilibrium,

1399
01:11:42,470 --> 01:11:46,330
that has to equal to 0, right?

1400
01:11:46,330 --> 01:11:50,440
So what I'm showing
you now is just

1401
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:52,030
sort of the
framework for how you

1402
01:11:52,030 --> 01:11:58,870
would calculate this using this
drift and diffusion equation.

1403
01:11:58,870 --> 01:12:02,200
So we have Ohm's
law that tells us

1404
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:05,230
how the voltage
difference produces

1405
01:12:05,230 --> 01:12:08,920
a current due to drift, and we
have Fick's law that tells us

1406
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:12,520
how much current is
due to diffusion,

1407
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:18,280
and you can set the sum of
those two things to equal zero,

1408
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:19,588
all right?

1409
01:12:19,588 --> 01:12:21,130
And so this is the
way it would look.

1410
01:12:21,130 --> 01:12:25,090
I don't expect you to follow
anything on this slide

1411
01:12:25,090 --> 01:12:29,140
just except to see that it
can be done in this way, OK?

1412
01:12:29,140 --> 01:12:34,240
So you don't even have
to write this down, OK?

1413
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:36,700
So the drift current
is proportion-- it's

1414
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:39,910
some constant times voltage.

1415
01:12:39,910 --> 01:12:44,350
Fisk's law is some constant
times that concentration

1416
01:12:44,350 --> 01:12:46,135
gradient, remember that.

1417
01:12:46,135 --> 01:12:50,748
And we just set those two things
equal and solve for delta V,

1418
01:12:50,748 --> 01:12:51,790
and that's what you find.

1419
01:12:51,790 --> 01:12:54,670
What you find is the delta V
is just some constant times

1420
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:58,330
the log of the difference
in concentrations

1421
01:12:58,330 --> 01:13:02,994
on the inside and outside, OK?

1422
01:13:02,994 --> 01:13:06,220
Now it turns out, there's a
way of calculating this that's

1423
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:08,980
much simpler and
more elegant, and I'm

1424
01:13:08,980 --> 01:13:13,130
going to show you
that calculation, OK?

1425
01:13:13,130 --> 01:13:13,639
Yes?

1426
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:15,597
AUDIENCE: And so like
the concentrations inside

1427
01:13:15,597 --> 01:13:18,382
and outside, like at the
[INAUDIBLE] beginning of the--

1428
01:13:18,382 --> 01:13:19,840
MICHALE FEE: Yes,
at the beginning.

1429
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:23,080
And the answer is that the
concentrations don't change

1430
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:25,720
very much through this
process, so you can even

1431
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:28,870
ignore that change, OK?

1432
01:13:28,870 --> 01:13:31,160
All right, everybody got this?

1433
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:31,660
All right.

1434
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:33,520
So here's how we're
going to calculate

1435
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:35,110
an alternative
way of calculating

1436
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:39,660
this voltage difference,
just really beautiful.

1437
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:41,420
We're going to use the
Boltzmann equation.

1438
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:45,290
The Boltzmann equation
tells the probability

1439
01:13:45,290 --> 01:13:48,350
of a particle
being in two states

1440
01:13:48,350 --> 01:13:51,280
as a function of the energy
difference between those two

1441
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:51,780
states.

1442
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:54,560
And one of those states is going
to correspond to a particle

1443
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:58,700
being on the left side of the
beaker or inside of our cell,

1444
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:01,772
and that particle being
outside of our cell

1445
01:14:01,772 --> 01:14:03,230
or on the other
side of the beaker.

1446
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:05,780
And those two, left
side and right side,

1447
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:08,600
have different energies, OK?

1448
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:11,990
So our system has two
states, a high-energy state

1449
01:14:11,990 --> 01:14:13,460
and a low-energy state.

1450
01:14:13,460 --> 01:14:15,518
Boltzmann equation just
says the probability

1451
01:14:15,518 --> 01:14:17,810
of being in state 1 divided
by the probability of being

1452
01:14:17,810 --> 01:14:22,050
in state 2 is just e to the
minus energy difference divided

1453
01:14:22,050 --> 01:14:22,550
by kT.

1454
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:27,820
k is the Boltzmann
constant, T is temperature--

1455
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:29,710
this is the same kT
that we talked about

1456
01:14:29,710 --> 01:14:30,550
in the last lecture.

1457
01:14:33,450 --> 01:14:36,500
Now, you can see if the
temperature is very low,

1458
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:37,700
all those particles are--

1459
01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:39,860
if the temperature is 0,
they're not being jostled,

1460
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:42,350
they're just sitting
there quietly.

1461
01:14:42,350 --> 01:14:44,720
They can't move, they
can't get into state 1,

1462
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:48,020
they just sit in state 2, OK?

1463
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:49,970
So the probability of
being in state 1 divided

1464
01:14:49,970 --> 01:14:54,250
by the probability of
being in state 2 is 0, OK?

1465
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:57,650
If kT is 0, this is
a very big number,

1466
01:14:57,650 --> 01:14:59,530
e to the minus big number is 0.

1467
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:03,810
Now let's say that
we heat things up

1468
01:15:03,810 --> 01:15:07,290
a bit so that now kT gets big.

1469
01:15:07,290 --> 01:15:12,690
So the Katie actually gets
approximately the same size

1470
01:15:12,690 --> 01:15:16,650
as the energy difference
between our two states.

1471
01:15:16,650 --> 01:15:18,200
So now some of
those particles can

1472
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:21,450
get jostled over into state 1.

1473
01:15:25,210 --> 01:15:27,130
And we can write down--

1474
01:15:27,130 --> 01:15:28,690
we can just calculate--

1475
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:31,180
you can see now that the
probability of being in state 1

1476
01:15:31,180 --> 01:15:32,020
is--

1477
01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:33,970
divided by the probability
of being in state 2

1478
01:15:33,970 --> 01:15:35,890
is bigger than 0 now.

1479
01:15:35,890 --> 01:15:37,720
You can actually
just calculate it.

1480
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:41,770
If the energy difference
is just twice kT, then

1481
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:45,880
energy difference,
2kT divided by kT,

1482
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:50,308
that ratio of probabilities
is just e to the minus 2, OK?

1483
01:15:53,550 --> 01:15:57,240
If the energy difference is
bigger, then you can see,

1484
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:59,100
that probability
ratio is smaller.

1485
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:00,630
The probability
of being a state 1

1486
01:16:00,630 --> 01:16:04,015
goes to 0 if you
increase that energy.

1487
01:16:04,015 --> 01:16:05,640
If you make that
energy difference very

1488
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:08,580
small at temperature
kT, you'd see

1489
01:16:08,580 --> 01:16:13,150
that if the energy difference
is about the same as kT,

1490
01:16:13,150 --> 01:16:14,830
then the probability
of being at state 1

1491
01:16:14,830 --> 01:16:16,660
is equal to the
probability in state 2.

1492
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:19,450
Those particles just
jostle back and forth

1493
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:21,880
between the two states.

1494
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:24,410
OK, so we're ready to do this.

1495
01:16:24,410 --> 01:16:26,810
Ratio of probabilities
is e to the minus energy

1496
01:16:26,810 --> 01:16:27,870
difference over KT.

1497
01:16:27,870 --> 01:16:30,950
What's the energy of a
particle here versus here?

1498
01:16:30,950 --> 01:16:33,200
Well, that's a charged
particle, the energy difference

1499
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:36,050
is just given by the
voltage difference.

1500
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:38,900
So energy is charged
times voltage where

1501
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:41,036
Q is the charge of an ion.

1502
01:16:41,036 --> 01:16:43,710
The ratio of probabilities
is e to the--

1503
01:16:43,710 --> 01:16:46,035
Q times voltage
difference over kT.

1504
01:16:50,330 --> 01:16:52,400
Take the log of
both sides, solve

1505
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:55,310
for the voltage difference,
V in minus V out

1506
01:16:55,310 --> 01:17:00,440
equals minus kT over Q times the
log of the probability ratio,

1507
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:05,600
but the probability is
just this concentration.

1508
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:09,350
And so we can write
this as delta V--

1509
01:17:09,350 --> 01:17:12,910
the voltage difference
is equal to kT

1510
01:17:12,910 --> 01:17:18,340
over Q, which is 25 millivolts,
times the log of the ratio

1511
01:17:18,340 --> 01:17:21,460
of potassium concentration
outside to potassium

1512
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:24,000
concentration inside.

1513
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,160
And that's exactly
the same equation

1514
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:30,660
that we get if you do that much
more complicated derivation

1515
01:17:30,660 --> 01:17:35,070
based on Fick's law and
Ohm's law, balancing Fick's

1516
01:17:35,070 --> 01:17:38,790
law and Ohm's law, OK?

1517
01:17:38,790 --> 01:17:40,920
And this is equilibrium
potential here,

1518
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:44,120
not electric field.

1519
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:46,610
OK, so let's take a look
at potassium concentrations

1520
01:17:46,610 --> 01:17:48,700
in a real cell.

1521
01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:50,470
This is actually from
squid giant axon.

1522
01:17:50,470 --> 01:17:52,450
400 millimolar inside.

1523
01:17:52,450 --> 01:17:56,200
So 20 millimolar outside, so
there's a lot of potassium

1524
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:59,590
inside of a cell, not
very much outside.

1525
01:17:59,590 --> 01:18:01,360
Plug those into our equation.

1526
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:04,090
kT over Q is 25,000
millimolar-- temperature

1527
01:18:04,090 --> 01:18:06,980
at room temperature.

1528
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:10,310
The log of that concentration
ratio is minus 3,

1529
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:12,430
so ek is minus 75 millivolts.

1530
01:18:12,430 --> 01:18:14,410
That means if we start
with a lot of potassium

1531
01:18:14,410 --> 01:18:20,110
inside of our cell, open up a
potassium-selective channel,

1532
01:18:20,110 --> 01:18:21,280
what happens?

1533
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:26,010
Potassium diffuses out
through that channel

1534
01:18:26,010 --> 01:18:30,460
and the voltage goes
to minus 75 millivolts.

1535
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:31,810
How do you know it's negative?

1536
01:18:31,810 --> 01:18:34,810
Like, I always can't remember
whether this is concentration

1537
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:37,820
inside or outside, outside
over inside, I don't know.

1538
01:18:37,820 --> 01:18:39,965
But the point is, you don't
actually have to know,

1539
01:18:39,965 --> 01:18:41,590
because you can just
look at it and see

1540
01:18:41,590 --> 01:18:44,080
the answer what sign it is.

1541
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:45,930
If you have positive ions--

1542
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:50,800
a high concentration of positive
ions inside, they diffuse out,

1543
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:54,970
the voltage inside of the
cell when positive ions leave

1544
01:18:54,970 --> 01:18:57,630
is going to do what?

1545
01:18:57,630 --> 01:19:02,040
It's going to go down, so
that's why it's minus, OK?

1546
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:06,500
So-- the battery
and in those video

1547
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:09,320
modules that I
recorded for you, it's

1548
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:12,260
going to explain how you
actually incorporate that

1549
01:19:12,260 --> 01:19:16,040
into a battery in
our circuit model.

1550
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:17,880
And so we've done
all of these things,

1551
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:20,270
we've looked at how membrane
capacitance and resistance

1552
01:19:20,270 --> 01:19:23,120
allows neurons to
integrate over time,

1553
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:25,740
we've learned how to write down
the differential equations,

1554
01:19:25,740 --> 01:19:28,520
we're now able to just
look at a current input

1555
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:30,530
and figure out the
voltage change,

1556
01:19:30,530 --> 01:19:33,320
and we now understand where
the batteries in a neuron

1557
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:35,110
come from.
