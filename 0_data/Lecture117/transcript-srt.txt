46
00:00:58,869 --> 00:01:00,559
 

47
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,280

48
00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:01,280
 

49
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,559
 differences

50
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,559
 

51
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,400
 in between uh remote working and being

52
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:06,400
 

53
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,880
 on house arrest like we

54
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,880
 

55
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,760
 have experience lately with the

56
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:09,760
 

57
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,320
 confinement

58
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,320
 

59
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,439
 and with with the current situation of

60
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,439
 

61
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,320
 the covet

62
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:16,320
 

63
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,280
 and then we'll see a few tools and

64
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,280
 

65
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,240
 techniques

66
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:20,240
 

67
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,680
 and to reduce the mental overload that's

68
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,680
 

69
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,159
 unfortunately coming

70
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:24,159
 

71
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,119
 with um we're very much working

72
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:25,119
 

73
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,240
 sometimes

74
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:28,240
 

75
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,880
 and also look into how to adapt the

76
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:28,880
 

77
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,720
 posture

78
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:32,720
 

79
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:37,759
 of leadership and management so

80
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:37,759
 

81
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,759
 first remote working well remote working

82
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:38,830
 

83
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,840
 often

84
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:50,469
 

85
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,640
 you can go and work into a co-working

86
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:54,640
 

87
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,040
 area into a coffee

88
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,040
 

89
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,920
 into a library wherever you want home

90
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:57,920
 

91
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,200
 working you

92
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,200
 

93
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,200
 are in your home environment and here

94
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,200
 

95
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,360
 we are mainly talking about reward

96
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,360
 

97
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,039
 working the coveted situation

98
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:09,039
 

99
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,360
 and confinement have led us to simply

100
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:11,360
 

101
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,959
 harm working which is a major difference

102
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:12,959
 

103
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,000
 in between the two

104
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:16,000
 

105
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,319
 um for a lot of people when you say

106
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,319
 

107
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,319
 wow i'm working from home or i'm

00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:20,319
 

109
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,800
 remotely working

110
00:02:20,309 --> 00:02:22,800
 

111
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,319
 often i get comments such as um or are

112
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,319
 

113
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,040
 you on holiday

114
00:02:24,309 --> 00:02:27,040
 

115
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,840
 well sometimes uh to be honest it felt

116
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,840
 

117
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,560
 more like

118
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:30,560
 

119
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,920
 uh under house arrest um why are you

120
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,920
 

121
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,160
 under house arrest because

122
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,160
 

123
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,680
 it can it can be a handle house arrest

124
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,680
 

125
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,480
 it is being suffered

126
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,480
 

127
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,040
 more than being chosen okay if the

128
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,040
 

129
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,040
 people

130
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:43,040
 

131
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:45,840
 the person he's choosing

132
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,840
 

133
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,319
 to remote working then it is much better

134
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:46,319
 

135
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,280
 okay

136
00:02:46,309 --> 00:02:49,280
 

137
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,959
 um also what can feel like another house

138
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,959
 

139
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,920
 arrest is

140
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:53,920
 

141
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,879
 when um the tools are in place okay and

142
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,879
 

143
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,360
 they're working well

144
00:02:54,869 --> 00:02:57,360
 

145
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,400
 but the culture of the company or the

146
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,400
 

147
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,239
 organization

148
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,239
 

149
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,239
 isn't actually changing and isn't

150
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:02,239
 

151
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:06,080
 adapting and you end up like

152
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:06,080
 

153
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:08,640
 um feeling like you're being spied on

154
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,640
 

155
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,599
 and uh some companies have i've even

156
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,599
 

157
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,640
 added some

158
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:12,640
 

159
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:15,440
 time badges some keypad recorder

160
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:15,440
 

161
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,280
 um all that makes you feel like you you

162
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,280
 

163
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,480
 you're not really trusted and that you

164
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,480
 

165
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,959
 can't really

166
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,959
 

167
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,760
 work at your best with that kind of

168
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:21,760
 

169
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,920
 things so it's

170
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,920
 

171
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,799
 very important that the culture is also

172
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:24,799
 

173
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,360
 changing

174
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:27,360
 

175
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,159
 and that goes as well with the manager

176
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,159
 

177
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,560
 if you have

178
00:03:28,149 --> 00:03:30,560
 

179
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,640
 a manager or a direct boss who's calling

180
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,640
 

181
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,280
 you all the time or who is wondering you

182
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,280
 

183
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,000
 know

184
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,000
 

185
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,640
 asking you to give a debrief in the

186
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,640
 

187
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,720
 morning

188
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,720
 

189
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,400
 and lunch time then when you're back

190
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,400
 

191
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,280
 then in the afternoon and evening

192
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:43,280
 

193
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,400
 it's just like it's not remote working

194
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,400
 

195
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,959
 it's actually

196
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:48,959
 

197
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,599
 being um and sometimes i don't know for

198
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:49,599
 

199
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,680
 you but

200
00:03:49,589 --> 00:03:51,680
 

201
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,439
 especially with the confinement and all

202
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,439
 

203
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,920
 the lockdown with kovid

204
00:03:53,429 --> 00:03:55,920
 

205
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,040
 remote working went more into like me

206
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,040
 

207
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,000
 having like

208
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,000
 

209
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,599
 several jobs at once you know with the

210
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,599
 

211
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,840
 dogs the kids the

212
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:03,840
 

213
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,280
 the job everything well that's not

214
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,280
 

215
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,239
 remote working that's

216
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:08,239
 

217
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,879
 more linked to the current situation

218
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:08,879
 

219
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,120
 when

220
00:04:08,869 --> 00:04:11,120
 

221
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,200
 kids have had to stay in the house as

222
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,200
 

223
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,239
 well and that kind of things

224
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:16,239
 

225
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,680
 real proper remote working should not be

226
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:17,680
 

227
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:22,320
 like that it should be

228
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:22,320
 

229
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:25,360
 um with a space as well for yourself

230
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,360
 

231
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,400
 um what happens as well is um i don't

232
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,400
 

233
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,320
 know you but

234
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,320
 

235
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,759
 very much working avocado like three

236
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,759
 

237
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,160
 screens in front of me

238
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:32,160
 

239
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,040
 and i've got notifications coming from

240
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,040
 

241
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,919
 everywhere

242
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,919
 

243
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,000
 okay i've got a slack i've got email i

244
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:38,000
 

245
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,840
 even have the skype i've got the teams

246
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,840
 

247
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,040
 and then suddenly it just pops and pops

248
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:43,040
 

249
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:46,160
 and pops and all i hear is

250
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:46,160
 

251
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:49,120
 and all that to be honest is leading

252
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:49,120
 

253
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,759
 to some technology stress people are

254
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:49,759
 

255
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,199
 calling that

256
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:53,199
 

257
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:56,479
 techno stress actually um and

258
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:56,479
 

259
00:04:53,199 --> 00:05:01,360
 all this stress can really

260
00:04:56,469 --> 00:05:01,360
 

261
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:04,960
 take us to total mental overload

262
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,960
 

263
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,759
 mental overload is really coming from

264
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,759
 

265
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,720
 task switching a lot of interruptions

266
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:08,720
 

267
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,600
 that you see

268
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,600
 

269
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,320
 you get from all the notifications from

270
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,320
 

271
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,520
 priorities not being managed properly

272
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:17,520
 

273
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:20,639
 from a lack of empowerment as well

274
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,639
 

275
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:24,160
 and all that leads to your your mind

276
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:24,160
 

277
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,560
 being completely saturated and you end

278
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:24,560
 

279
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,199
 up by

280
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,199
 

281
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,600
 accomplishing less being less productive

282
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:29,600
 

283
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,160
 than if i don't like that word

284
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,160
 

285
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,840
 and it deteriorates as well your

286
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,840
 

287
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,440
 relationship sometimes

288
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:37,440
 

289
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:41,520
 and it can lead to a complete burnout

290
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:41,520
 

291
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:44,000
 so we really want to try and avoid that

292
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:44,000
 

293
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,039
 so first there are a few a few

294
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,039
 

295
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,160
 individual

296
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:48,160
 

297
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:50,240
 tips and tools that you can put in place

298
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,240
 

299
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,600
 those are a few things that i have tried

300
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,600
 

301
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,880
 myself as well

302
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:54,880
 

303
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,240
 all that people i know have tried and

304
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,240
 

305
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,240
 have worked

306
00:05:56,230 --> 00:06:00,240
 

307
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:04,400
 um the first one is the problem with

308
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:04,400
 

309
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:07,759
 remote working is that we do not have

310
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:07,759
 

311
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,319
 this commuting buffer that we used to

312
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:08,319
 

313
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,080
 have

314
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:10,080
 

315
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,759
 you know the commuting buffer even

316
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,759
 

317
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,120
 though i was alone

318
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:15,120
 

319
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:17,440
 moaning about the the metro the tube

320
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,440
 

321
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,720
 or the trap then at least you know what

322
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,720
 

323
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,440
 i could read my book

324
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,440
 

325
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,039
 or i could listen to my music when he if

326
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,039
 

327
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,080
 i am in my home

328
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:26,080
 

329
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:30,080
 i have no buffer in between

330
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:30,080
 

331
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:33,039
 my home and my work so a few tips here

332
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:33,039
 

333
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,240
 if you have an office well once it's the

334
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:34,240
 

335
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,560
 end of your day

336
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,560
 

337
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,319
 you shut your laptop you turn everything

338
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,319
 

339
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,280
 off and then you take five minutes for

340
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:39,280
 

341
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,639
 yourself

342
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,639
 

343
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:45,360
 five minutes for yourself to either

00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:00,240
 

413
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,000
 um another thing is um especially at the

414
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,000
 

415
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,120
 beginning we said when it was the

416
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,120
 

417
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,840
 lockdown we said

418
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,840
 

419
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,199
 everybody use a video conf called put

420
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,199
 

421
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,840
 your videos on

422
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:09,840
 

423
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,720
 and all that it's very good but the

424
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,720
 

425
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,759
 problem is

426
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:13,759
 

427
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,520
 um after a whole day of zoom we're using

428
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:15,520
 

429
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,080
 zoom where i am right now and

430
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:18,080
 

431
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,639
 after a whole day of zoom i'm lacking of

432
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,639
 

433
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,919
 energy

434
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:21,919
 

435
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,759
 i'm absolutely shattered i don't want to

436
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:23,759
 

437
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,960
 speak to anybody i don't want to even

438
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:26,960
 

439
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:30,479
 watch anything tv or anything so

440
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:30,479
 

441
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:34,080
 what i would say is use the video calls

442
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:34,080
 

443
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:37,440
 when necessary okay and don't hesitate

444
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,440
 

445
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,599
 getting like a kind of a social contract

446
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,599
 

447
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,279
 with the rest of the company or your

448
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:41,279
 

449
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,640
 teams to

450
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:44,640
 

451
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,399
 make sure that everybody decides on what

452
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,399
 

453
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,279
 is the best way to go

454
00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:49,279
 

455
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,080
 with video calls why because for some

456
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:50,080
 

457
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,800
 people

458
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,800
 

459
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,200
 if you turn your camera on they feel

460
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,200
 

461
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,440
 like

462
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:55,440
 

463
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,200
 uh you it's like if you were in the same

464
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,200
 

465
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,080
 room and you were turning

466
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:00,080
 

467
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,560
 your back against them but for some

468
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:00,560
 

469
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,800
 others

470
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,800
 

471
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,160
 having the camera on especially going

472
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,160
 

473
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,120
 into your home

474
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:07,120
 

475
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,200
 it's like a big intrusion okay a bit

476
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,200
 

477
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,640
 intrusion so the best is to have

478
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:12,640
 

479
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:15,680
 some social contracts so everybody

480
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,680
 

481
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,080
 um co-construct the way we are going to

482
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,080
 

483
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,600
 work

484
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:19,600
 

485
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:23,120
 with conference goals and also

486
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:23,120
 

487
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,839
 um we have a few tools

488
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,839
 

489
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,600
 and you can look at uh some systemic

490
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:27,600
 

491
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,399
 delegated roles

492
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:30,399
 

493
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,600
 um that allows to engage everybody

494
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:31,600
 

495
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,000
 within the meeting

496
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,000
 

497
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,120
 not to get bored and you know sometimes

498
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,120
 

499
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,480
 fall asleep

500
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:38,480
 

501
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:42,000
 at their side even if i shouldn't

502
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:42,000
 

503
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:45,200
 with delegated roles within the meeting

504
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:45,200
 

505
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,720
 everybody is engaged it also gives

506
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,720
 

507
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,240
 a bit of free time as well for the

508
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,240
 

509
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,760
 facilitator because

510
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,760
 

511
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:55,360
 when it's a remote the facilitator

512
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:55,360
 

513
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:58,399
 needs really a lot of

514
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:58,399
 

515
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,200
 energy okay so with delegated roads you

516
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,200
 

517
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,519
 have someone

518
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,519
 

519
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,560
 who is a time keeper someone's going to

520
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:02,560
 

521
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,079
 be the decision

522
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,079
 

523
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,680
 pusher doesn't mean that he's going to

524
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:05,680
 

525
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,279
 make the decision he's going to make

526
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,279
 

527
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,320
 sure the decisions you know

528
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:10,320
 

529
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,279
 are are being taken before the end of

530
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,279
 

531
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,360
 the meeting

532
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:13,360
 

533
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,279
 um someone else is going to be described

534
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,279
 

535
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,800
 but it's going to take all the notes

536
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:16,800
 

537
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,720
 and all that kind of things that can

538
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,720
 

539
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,040
 really help the meeting and make it

540
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:21,040
 

541
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,519
 less uh straining the energy for

542
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,519
 

543
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,480
 everybody

544
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:26,480
 

545
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,320
 and very important as well keep some

546
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,320
 

547
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,640
 focus time because same thing

548
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:30,640
 

549
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,720
 at the beginning my agenda i was like

550
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,720
 

551
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,440
 zoom call after the uncle

552
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:35,440
 

553
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,920
 i barely had even time to get up get a

554
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:35,920
 

555
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,120
 coffee

556
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:39,120
 

557
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,760
 get a drink you know um so what we did

558
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,760
 

559
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,040
 and what we tried as well is to have

560
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,040
 

561
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,440
 once again

562
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,440
 

563
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,320
 just a social contract within the

564
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,320
 

565
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,720
 organization

566
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,720
 

567
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,560
 just a culture you know and share the

568
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,560
 

569
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,160
 things and when we can try

570
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:54,160
 

571
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:57,040
 for example having 45 or 50 minutes

572
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:57,040
 

573
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,600
 meeting and only on the top of each hour

574
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,600
 

575
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,000
 or

576
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,000
 

577
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,920
 you know 25 minutes and only on the top

578
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,920
 

579
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,240
 of of the half hour

580
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,240
 

581
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,920
 that allows you to have at least five

582
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,920
 

583
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,480
 minutes breaking between

584
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,480
 

585
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,279
 meetings something else as well do not

586
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,279
 

587
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,040
 hesitate

588
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:13,040
 

589
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:15,760
 to blog block some virtual meeting

590
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,760
 

591
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,200
 basically block two hours in your agenda

592
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,200
 

593
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,399
 you don't have a meeting

594
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:20,399
 

595
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:23,440
 doesn't matter it's your focus time

596
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:23,440
 

597
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,519
 and um then this is a time when you know

598
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,519
 

599
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,760
 nobody is gonna come and give you and

600
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:27,760
 

601
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,720
 put any meeting in your agenda

602
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,720
 

603
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,600
 and here the tomato is um the pomodoro

604
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,600
 

605
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,920
 technique

606
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,920
 

607
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,600
 and it's so it's a focusing technique

608
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,600
 

609
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,079
 that we've been trying

610
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:38,079
 

611
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,360
 and it's like you take a task and you

612
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:39,360
 

613
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,760
 work on your task

614
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,760
 

615
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,120
 focused on nothing else you turn all the

616
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,120
 

617
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,680
 notifications off

618
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,680
 

619
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,360
 you you you shut your inbox you shout

620
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,360
 

621
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,279
 your instant messaging

622
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,279
 

623
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,240
 and you work on your tasks for 25

624
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:52,240
 

625
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:54,560
 minutes after the 25 minutes

626
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,560
 

627
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,600
 you take a break three to five minutes

628
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,600
 

629
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,240
 but a real break

630
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,240
 

631
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,800
 not to look into another task then after

632
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,800
 

633
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,959
 that break you start another 25 minutes

634
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,959
 

635
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,920
 you do that three times and after the

636
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:03,920
 

637
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,120
 third one

638
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:07,120
 

639
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,240
 you take a real 15 minute break and what

640
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,240
 

641
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,399
 we tried because

642
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,399
 

643
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,600
 people were not really willing to try

644
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:11,600
 

645
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,040
 that because they thought

646
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,040
 

647
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,440
 everybody is going to think that i'm not

648
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,440
 

649
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,000
 working and so in the slack we're using

650
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,000
 

651
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,360
 slack

652
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:19,360
 

653
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,240
 i created like a a status called with a

654
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,240
 

655
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,279
 tomato

656
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:23,279
 

657
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,720
 called pomodoro and then you can see on

658
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:24,720
 

659
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,880
 the slack messages

660
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,880
 

661
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,320
 that the person is in pomodoro it

662
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,320
 

663
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,399
 doesn't mean that it's off

664
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,399
 

665
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,839
 he's just working and he's focusing on

666
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:31,839
 

667
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,880
 his work

668
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:34,880
 

669
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:37,600
 um another one a very good one is a

670
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,600
 

671
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,480
 walking meeting for some of the meetings

672
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,480
 

673
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,720
 um

674
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,720
 

675
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,880
 it's either if you have you know we're

676
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,880
 

677
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,760
 using zoom or teams and we've got it on

678
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,760
 

679
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,600
 the phone

680
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,600
 

681
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,600
 just put your your headphones on and

682
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,600
 

683
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,399
 walk around either outside

684
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:50,399
 

685
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,040
 or in even in the house you can walk

686
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:51,040
 

687
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,720
 around

688
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,720
 

689
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,160
 if you don't have the tools on your

690
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,160
 

691
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,959
 phone um

692
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,959
 

693
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,800
 don't put the camera on you can even

694
00:12:56,949 --> 00:12:58,800
 

695
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,720
 even move around with your laptop

696
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,720
 

697
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,160
 or put the sound very high if you just

698
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,160
 

699
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,079
 have to listen

700
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,079
 

701
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,160
 and walk around that's really good as

702
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:06,160
 

703
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,399
 well for managers when we do a

704
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,399
 

705
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,800
 one-to-one meeting and that really

706
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:10,800
 

707
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:14,160
 allows us to to get some exercises

708
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,160
 

709
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:17,440
 and not feeling like we are stuck

710
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:17,440
 

711
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:20,240
 in front of the computer all day long

712
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,240
 

713
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,279
 and when you take a break take a real

714
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,279
 

715
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,120
 break what i mean

716
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:24,120
 

717
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,360
 is to reduce the mental overload take a

718
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,360
 

719
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,639
 non-electronic

720
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:28,639
 

721
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,519
 break so do whatever you want for as

722
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:29,519
 

723
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,399
 long as you want

724
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:32,399
 

725
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,519
 but go out meet people okay maybe not

726
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:33,519
 

727
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,320
 with the covet

728
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:36,320
 

729
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,600
 but still you know um don't go from one

730
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,600
 

731
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,639
 computer to

732
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:40,639
 

733
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:44,399
 uh to another one a real break

734
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:44,399
 

735
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:49,440
 to get to get the energy level really

736
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:49,440
 

737
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:52,560
 stabilized um the problem with all that

738
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:52,560
 

739
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,920
 of course is that we have a constant

740
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:55,920
 

741
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:58,160
 communication signals um

742
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:58,160
 

743
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,000
 and that's where a change of culture is

744
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,000
 

745
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,880
 also extremely important because i don't

746
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:00,880
 

747
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,839
 know you but

748
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,839
 

749
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,880
 i come from a culture where using uh

750
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:04,880
 

751
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,920
 emoticons

752
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:07,920
 

753
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,959
 using gifs or you know sending photos

754
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:08,959
 

755
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,760
 and all that

756
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:11,760
 

757
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,560
 is not really well seen in the workplace

758
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,560
 

759
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,800
 we're here

760
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,800
 

761
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,440
 since the remote working i've been

762
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:17,440
 

763
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,000
 sending slack messages with emoticons

764
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,000
 

765
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,360
 all over

766
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:21,360
 

767
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,480
 with gifs with photos just so

768
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:24,480
 

769
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:27,760
 i could share my mood

770
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:27,760
 

771
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:31,120
 share my message share my feeling

772
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,120
 

773
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,600
 because we didn't have that face-to-face

774
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,600
 

775
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,199
 communication so this is a whole lot of

776
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,199
 

777
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,320
 alerting signals

778
00:14:35,189 --> 00:14:38,320
 

779
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:39,120
 that were lost and one of my colleagues

780
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,120
 

781
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,079
 said

782
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:42,079
 

783
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,360
 why did you always send gifts and things

784
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:43,360
 

785
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,079
 like that and i said well

786
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,079
 

787
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,120
 that's why because now you know exactly

788
00:14:46,069 --> 00:14:47,120
 

789
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:50,000
 what message i

790
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:50,000
 

791
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,040
 am sending you if i put a gif with it so

792
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,040
 

793
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,240
 try it out i mean

794
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:54,240
 

795
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:58,240
 it reduces the amount of of conflict uh

796
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:58,240
 

797
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,800
 that could happen and of course uh one

798
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:58,800
 

799
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,519
 of my

800
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:01,519
 

801
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,959
 biggest thing here is uh emotions when i

802
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:02,959
 

803
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:06,320
 talk about emoticons

804
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:06,320
 

805
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:10,480
 it's even it's even more uh the fact

806
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:10,480
 

807
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:13,040
 when we are working remotely um

808
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,040
 

809
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,079
 emotions are extremely important to be

810
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,079
 

811
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,360
 taken care of

812
00:15:14,069 --> 00:15:17,360
 

813
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:20,480
 we need to really uh

814
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:20,480
 

815
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:23,600
 improve our the way we receive them

816
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:23,600
 

817
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,279
 okay um because especially uh with very

818
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,279
 

819
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,720
 much working we need to be on the

820
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:26,720
 

821
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,440
 empathy side

822
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:29,440
 

823
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,160
 empathy meaning i don't feel what you're

824
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,160
 

825
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,519
 feeling

826
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:33,519
 

827
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,399
 what i know is you are feeling something

828
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:34,399
 

829
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,959
 it is real

830
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:36,959
 

831
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,880
 for you and i'm respecting that even

832
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:38,880
 

833
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,279
 though i don't feel it even though i can

834
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,279
 

835
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,800
 think it's stupid for me i would not

836
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:42,800
 

837
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,959
 react that way

838
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,959
 

839
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,000
 well it doesn't matter you are feeling

840
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:46,000
 

841
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,839
 it and

842
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:49,839
 

843
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,480
 it is the reality and

844
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:52,480
 

845
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,199
 if we don't do that especially with the

846
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,199
 

847
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,199
 covey

848
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:55,199
 

849
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:57,120
 then there's gonna be a build up a

850
00:15:55,189 --> 00:15:57,120
 

851
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,079
 massive buildup that could completely

852
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,079
 

853
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,480
 explode

854
00:15:58,069 --> 00:16:00,480
 

855
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,839
 at some point you know with resentment

856
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,839
 

857
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,320
 within the nation

858
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:04,320
 

859
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,880
 and then the fear could go up so it's

860
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:04,880
 

861
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,240
 just

862
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:08,240
 

863
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,040
 accept be empathetic and that's where

864
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,040
 

865
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,040
 i'm going to the

866
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:11,040
 

867
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,880
 to the third and last part of the

868
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,880
 

869
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,079
 presentation which is about

870
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:16,079
 

871
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:19,120
 managerial posture because as a leader

872
00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:19,120
 

873
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:21,920
 it's even more important to welcome

874
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:21,920
 

875
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,320
 those emotions you know make sure that

876
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:22,320
 

877
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,720
 we

878
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,720
 

879
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,880
 understand that the emotions are real

880
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,880
 

881
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,680
 they're not the ones we would have maybe

882
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:29,680
 

883
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,720
 or maybe yes but they are real for the

884
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,720
 

885
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,560
 person

886
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:34,560
 

887
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:38,560
 and we are here to grow the people

888
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:38,560
 

889
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:42,240
 so um the first thing is

890
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:42,240
 

891
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:45,279
 let go let go and trust okay

892
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:45,279
 

893
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,600
 as a manager as a leader especially

894
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:47,600
 

895
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,440
 remotely working because you're gonna

896
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,440
 

897
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,160
 like you're gonna go mental

898
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:52,160
 

899
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,000
 if you don't learn how to let go because

900
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,000
 

901
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,720
 you don't have the people with you

902
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:56,720
 

903
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,199
 it's gonna make you really go mental

904
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:59,199
 

905
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,880
 it's not gonna work out so

906
00:16:59,189 --> 00:17:02,880
 

907
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:04,559
 trust your people when i say your people

908
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,559
 

909
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,640
 is the people you're looking after it's

910
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:06,640
 

911
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,039
 not your people like if you were owning

912
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:07,039
 

913
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,160
 them

914
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:10,160
 

915
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:13,199
 but trust your people earn the trust

916
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:13,199
 

917
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,400
 from your people help people trust each

918
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:14,400
 

919
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,199
 other

920
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:17,199
 

921
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,079
 but for that trust yourselves first

922
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:18,079
 

923
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,520
 that's the first

924
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:21,520
 

925
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,559
 step as a leader if you start trusting

926
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,559
 

927
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,959
 yourself

928
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:24,959
 

929
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,760
 then you can really start trusting the

930
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:25,760
 

931
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,400
 people

932
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,400
 

933
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,000
 and help people trusting each other and

934
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,000
 

935
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,679
 that's when you can start

936
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,679
 

937
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,280
 delegating we're talking about

938
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:33,280
 

939
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:36,960
 delegating of

940
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:36,960
 

941
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:39,520
 decisions not actions and for that

942
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:39,520
 

943
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,880
 i will provide all the links for that um

944
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,880
 

945
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,960
 there is the delegation

946
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:44,960
 

947
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:47,520
 pocket from yoga naped on management 3.0

948
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:47,520
 

949
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,960
 and it's absolutely fantastic this there

950
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,960
 

951
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,480
 are seven levels

952
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:52,480
 

953
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:55,440
 of of delegation and i would say

954
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:55,440
 

955
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,320
 it's more like about empowerment and

956
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:56,320
 

957
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,600
 empowerment

958
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:59,600
 

959
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,080
 is more about a reflexive relationship

960
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,080
 

961
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,000
 between

962
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:04,000
 

963
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:06,720
 two equal partners and instead of having

964
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:06,720
 

965
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,200
 um superiors and subordinates in our

966
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,200
 

967
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,799
 language

968
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,799
 

969
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,640
 maybe we should have something like you

970
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:10,640
 

971
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:14,720
 know control giver

972
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:14,720
 

973
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:17,840
 and control takers and with that um

974
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:17,840
 

975
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:21,679
 delegation pocket what we get is

976
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:21,679
 

977
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:24,960
 we at me as a leader i am a control

978
00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:24,960
 

979
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,919
 giver and i am ready to give you that

980
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:25,919
 

981
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,120
 much control

982
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:29,120
 

983
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:31,679
 how much control are you ready to take

984
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,679
 

985
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,559
 on the other side and that becomes

986
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:32,559
 

987
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:37,440
 really

988
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:37,440
 

989
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:40,480
 a relationship equal partner to partner

990

 the people is the best asset of an

 organization

1002

00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,280
 

1023
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,720
 need but they are actually very

1024
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,720
 

1025
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,200
 short-term

1026
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:19,200
 

1027
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,440
 things so i'm gonna be very happy when

1028
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:21,440
 

1029
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,840
 i'm gonna have a promotion or bonus

1030
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,840
 

1031
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,240
 and then after a couple of months the

1032
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,240
 

1033
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,000
 salary comes in and it becomes

1034
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:28,000
 

1035
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,160
 something normal something that i am

1036
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:30,160
 

1037
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,840
 actually going to expect

1038
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:33,840
 

1039
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:37,360
 and then i won't be as motivated anymore

1040
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:37,360
 

1041
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:40,160
 so here we're talking about intrinsic

1042
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,160
 

1043
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,679
 motivation so you know what gives you a

1044
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,679
 

1045
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,840
 kick to get up in the morning

1046
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:43,840
 

1047
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,640
 what makes you really tick what makes

1048
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,640
 

1049
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,919
 you get go and wanting to go to work you

1050
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:47,919
 

1051
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,440
 know what really is

1052
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:51,440
 

1053
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:53,360
 the intrinsic desires and once again

1054
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,360
 

1055
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,880
 yoganapello

1056
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:56,880
 

1057
00:19:53,360 --> 00:20:00,000
 went on to um ten intrinsic

1058
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:00,000
 

1059
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:03,919
 motivational drivers um and

1060
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,919
 

1061
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:07,120
 the game is called the moving motivators

1062
00:20:03,909 --> 00:20:07,120
 

1063
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:10,080
 and it's a very good good game and

1064
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:10,080
 

1065
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:13,120
 i've done it uh remotely as well we used

1066
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:13,120
 

1067
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,520
 a lucidchart and i created all the cards

1068
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:15,520
 

1069
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,039
 um because i didn't know how to do it i

1070
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,039
 

1071
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,000
 used to do it face to face and here

1072
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:18,000
 

1073
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,880
 remotely

1074
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,880
 

1075
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,200
 also had to change all my tools and i

1076
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:21,200
 

1077
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,559
 did

1078
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:24,559
 

1079
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:27,520
 it remotely and we we worked on

1080
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:27,520
 

1081
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,640
 okay um those are all your motivational

1082
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,640
 

1083
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,919
 drivers

1084
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:31,919
 

1085
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,799
 and individually now okay how is remote

1086
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:32,799
 

1087
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,760
 working

1088
00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:35,760
 

1089
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,720
 actually impacting your motivational

1090
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,720
 

1091
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,679
 drivers

1092
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:39,679
 

1093
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,880
 are they impacting them positively or

1094
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:40,880
 

1095
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,679
 negatively

1096
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:43,679
 

1097
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,240
 and then when when the remote working

1098
00:20:43,669 --> 00:20:44,240
 

1099
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,640
 was

1100
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:46,640
 

1101
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,960
 impacting the team negatively then we

1102
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,960
 

1103
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,039
 would be working i would be working with

1104
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:51,039
 

1105
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,679
 those person with those individuals to

1106
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:51,679
 

1107
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:55,120
 see

1108
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:55,120
 

1109
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:58,320
 how we can work together so the impact

1110
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:58,320
 

1111
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:01,440
 is reduced and that we can work

1112
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:01,440
 

1113
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:04,240
 on really positively changing their

1114
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:04,240
 

1115
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:07,120
 motivational drivers

1116
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:07,120
 

1117
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,760
 for that to happen uh we're back onto

1118
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:07,760
 

1119
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,559
 you know

1120
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,559
 

1121
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,679
 what i was saying earlier a reflexive

1122
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:11,679
 

1123
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:14,720
 relationship between

1124
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:14,720
 

1125
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:18,400
 two equal partners and

1126
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:18,400
 

1127
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:22,480
 i will i'll learn on this um manager

1128
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:22,480
 

1129
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:24,880
 or not manager um superior subordinates

1130
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:24,880
 

1131
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,840
 i'm more into control gamer and cultural

1132
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:25,840
 

1133
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,679
 takers

1134
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:29,679
 

1135
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:33,600
 but all that has to happen on the equal

1136
00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:33,600
 

1137
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:36,000
 partnership and an equal communication

1138
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:36,000
 

1139
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,720
 and i went into studying a little bit

1140
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:36,720
 

1141
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,280
 about

1142
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:39,280
 

1143
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,520
 transactional analysis because i was

1144
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,520
 

1145
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:44,799
 wondering why sometimes when people

1146
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,799
 

1147
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:48,080
 were talking to me i certainly

1148
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:48,080
 

1149
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:50,000
 had some reactions that

1150
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:50,000
 

1151
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,360
 i couldn't understand at the time you

1152
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:51,360
 

1153
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,960
 know and i was like

1154
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:54,960
 

1155
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:57,679
 why is it that i'm reacting that way

1156
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:57,679
 

1157
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,960
 and the transactional analysis is saying

1158
00:21:57,669 --> 00:21:58,960
 

1159
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:02,080
 that

1160
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:02,080
 

1161
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,880
 most of the communication breakdowns

1162
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,880
 

1163
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,679
 happen because actually we are not fully

1164
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:05,679
 

1165
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,880
 present

1166
00:22:05,669 --> 00:22:08,880
 

1167
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:12,080
 in our conversations and now

1168
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:12,080
 

1169
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:15,120
 our past egos are actually taking

1170
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:15,120
 

1171
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,000
 over the transactions and i've seen it

1172
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,000
 

1173
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,520
 happening even

1174
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:19,520
 

1175
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,080
 more with the remote working because

1176
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:22,080
 

1177
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,799
 with the remote working my my brain

1178
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,799
 

1179
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,440
 could be

1180
00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:25,440
 

1181
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,000
 taken on on everywhere you know and i

1182
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:26,000
 

1183
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,799
 wasn't

1184
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:28,799
 

1185
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,679
 actually completely focusing on the

1186
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:29,679
 

1187
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,480
 under here

1188
00:22:29,669 --> 00:22:32,480
 

1189
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,720
 and now and then i realized that my my

1190
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:34,720
 

1191
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,559
 behavior or the answers that i could

1192
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,559
 

1193
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,799
 give back to people

1194
00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:38,799
 

1195
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,559
 were not my usual ones and that's what

1196
00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:40,559
 

1197
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,640
 made me look into more into the

1198
00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:42,640
 

1199
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:45,039
 transactional analysis

1200
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:45,039
 

1201
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,760
 and this analysis is telling us that we

1202
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:45,760
 

1203
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:49,360
 have

1204
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:49,360
 

1205
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,080
 three ego states two ego states from the

1206
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,080
 

1207
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,120
 past

1208
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:53,120
 

1209
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,000
 which is the parent and the child and

1210
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,000
 

1211
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,120
 from the parent

1212
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:57,120
 

1213
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,320
 one it's all the the attitudes the

1214
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:59,320
 

1215
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,799
 feelings the behavior that have been

1216
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,799
 

1217
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:03,440
 incorporated from

1218
00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:03,440
 

1219
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:05,760
 our parents and so because we are not

1220
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,760
 

1221
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:09,440
 focused in the here and now

1222
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:09,440
 

1223
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:12,640
 our instinct is automatically answering

1224
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:12,640
 

1225
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,720
 how our parents could have answered and

1226
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,720
 

1227
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:18,240
 in the parent's

1228
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:18,240
 

1229
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:20,960
 ego you have the nurturing parents

1230
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,960
 

1231
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,760
 and the controlling parent who's gonna

1232
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:21,760
 

1233
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,159
 you know

1234
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,159
 

1235
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,840
 be more more assertive be more

1236
00:23:24,149 --> 00:23:25,840
 

1237
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,919
 judgmental

1238
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,919
 

1239
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,760
 and then you have the other ego state

1240
00:23:27,909 --> 00:23:29,760
 

1241
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,080
 from the past which is the child

1242
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:32,080
 

1243
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,000
 ego state which by the way is a very

1244
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:34,000
 

1245
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,000
 good equal state because that's our

1246
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:36,000
 

1247
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,640
 creative one that's where we get all

1248
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:38,640
 

1249
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,320
 our creativity that's where we learn all

1250
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,320
 

1251
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,640
 our emotions

1252
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:42,640
 

1253
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,679
 but here in our conversations and

1254
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:43,679
 

1255
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,919
 transactions

1256
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:45,919
 

1257
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,159
 we don't want that ego state to take

1258
00:23:45,909 --> 00:23:48,159
 

1259
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,200
 over but all those three words are very

1260
00:23:48,149 --> 00:23:49,200
 

1261
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,120
 important

1262
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:51,120
 

1263
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,360
 and our child it's all about the

1264
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:53,360
 

1265
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,960
 feelings the emotions that we've had

1266
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:56,960
 

1267
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:59,279
 as a child and we can have an attitude

1268
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:59,279
 

1269
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,559
 rebelling attitude usually when the

1270
00:23:59,269 --> 00:24:00,559
 

1271
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,240
 controlling parent is

1272
00:24:00,549 --> 00:24:02,240
 

1273
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,400
 talking to us then we're going to start

1274
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:04,400
 

1275
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:07,840
 rebelling if we were a rebel

1276
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:07,840
 

1277
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:10,880
 or like being that even submitted

1278
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:10,880
 

1279
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,600
 um and that's not what we want in the

1280
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:11,600
 

1281
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,840
 workplace

1282
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,840
 

1283
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,080
 especially in the workplace and

1284
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:16,080
 

1285
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:19,360
 especially when we are dealing

1286
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:19,360
 

1287
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:22,559
 with relationship in between leadership

1288
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:22,559
 

1289
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:26,000
 and and employees what we want

1290
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:26,000
 

1291
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:26,640
 is we want our adult ego state to take

1292
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:26,640
 

1293
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,960
 over

1294
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,960
 

1295
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,080
 because the adult ecostate is the one

1296
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,080
 

1297
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,039
 that think

1298
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:33,039
 

1299
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,760
 and act based on what's happening here

1300
00:24:33,029 --> 00:24:33,760
 

1301
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,799
 and

1302
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:36,799
 

1303
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:40,400
 now it's our analysis uh

1304
00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:40,400
 

1305
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:43,919
 brain basically was working and

1306
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:43,919
 

1307
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:48,400
 what we are working towards then

1308
00:24:43,909 --> 00:24:48,400
 

1309
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:51,039
 is to have an alignment in between

1310
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:51,039
 

1311
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,000
 the expected and the received

1312
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:52,000
 

1313
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,000
 transaction

1314
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,000
 

1315
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,120
 so when i talk about transactions the

1316
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:55,120
 

1317
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,320
 conversation

1318
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:58,320
 

1319
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:02,080
 so if i am talking to you

1320
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:02,080
 

1321
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:03,760
 as an adult then i am expecting you to

1322
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,760
 

1323
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,400
 answer to me

1324
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:06,400
 

1325
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,960
 as an adult if your answer that comes

1326
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:06,960
 

1327
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,840
 back

1328
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:09,840
 

1329
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:12,240
 is more like apparent one then

1330
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:12,240
 

1331
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,600
 automatically if i'm not focused if i'm

1332
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,600
 

1333
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,799
 not here and that

1334
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:16,799
 

1335
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,640
 i'm gonna answer as a child because the

1336
00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:18,640
 

1337
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:21,840
 parent is talking to me

1338
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:21,840
 

1339
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:25,679
 so that's a very um very important

1340
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:25,679
 

1341
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:29,360
 uh very important side of the leadership

1342
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:29,360
 

1343
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:31,840
 especially in remote working why because

1344
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:31,840
 

1345
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,440
 if we go back to mental overload the

1346
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,440
 

1347
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:37,760
 mental overload

1348
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:37,760
 

1349
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:40,960
 is created when what is required

1350
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:40,960
 

1351
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:44,159
 to perform a task costs more

1352
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:44,159
 

1353
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,120
 than the energy we have available and

1354
00:25:44,149 --> 00:25:45,120
 

1355
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:48,400
 this kind

1356
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:48,400
 

1357
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:52,080
 of miscommunication

1358
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:52,080
 

1359
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:55,440
 is hurting our mental and this is

1360
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:55,440
 

1361
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:58,880
 coming to to to gain and to eat up

1362
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:58,880
 

1363
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:01,679
 our limited cognitive resources

1364
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:01,679
 

1365
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,559
 and so we can't deal with all the tasks

1366
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:02,559
 

1367
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,000
 that we have

1368
00:26:02,549 --> 00:26:06,000
 

1369
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:07,039
 to deal with and our mind is becoming

1370
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,039
 

1371
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,480
 completely

1372
00:26:07,029 --> 00:26:10,480
 

1373
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:13,840
 saturated and it can really come to

1374
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:13,840
 

1375
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:16,880
 um okay burn out burnout is the is

1376
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:16,880
 

1377
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,440
 the end but before that you know it can

1378
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:17,440
 

1379
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,480
 come to

1380
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:20,480
 

1381
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:23,600
 a lot of physical problems as well

1382
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:23,600
 

1383
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:27,360
 and not feeling well and especially

1384
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:27,360
 

1385
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:30,559
 not being able to focus and to work

1386
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:30,559
 

1387
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:33,039
 on on the task you know um

1388
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:33,039
 

1389
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:34,559
 we're accomplishing less than we are

1390
00:26:33,029 --> 00:26:34,559
 

1391
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:37,520
 used to

1392
00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:37,520
 

1393
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,880
 um so that's what i wanted to really

1394
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:38,880
 

1395
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:43,039
 share with you

1396
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:43,039
 

1397
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:45,039
 remote working is something that can be

1398
00:26:43,029 --> 00:26:45,039
 

1399
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:47,039
 extremely good

1400
00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:47,039
 

1401
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:48,480
 yes as we see as we have seen at the

1402
00:26:47,029 --> 00:26:48,480
 

1403
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:51,919
 beginning of the session

1404
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:51,919
 

1405
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,760
 the tooling is extremely important um

1406
00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:53,760
 

1407
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:54,799
 from experience from what i've seen up

1408
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:54,799
 

1409
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,679
 until now

1410
00:26:54,789 --> 00:26:57,679
 

1411
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,320
 companies i've actually put the tooling

1412
00:26:57,669 --> 00:26:58,320
 

1413
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,279
 in place

1414
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:01,279
 

1415
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,960
 pretty good okay pretty well even my

1416
00:27:01,269 --> 00:27:02,960
 

1417
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,880
 company where i work

1418
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,880
 

1419
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,360
 all the tools were here we had all the

1420

00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,279
 

1427
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,320

 for like

1464
00:28:11,669 --> 00:28:14,960
 

1465
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:18,559
 half an hour okay

1469
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:23,440
 energizing people

1470
00:28:20,149 --> 00:28:23,440
 

1471
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:26,480
 um yes yes for for energizing

1472
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:26,480
 

1473
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,399
 people basically it's um

1474
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:28,399
 

1475
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,600
 what i've seen is we talk a lot about

1476
00:28:28,389 --> 00:28:29,600
 

1477
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:31,919
 motivation

1478
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:31,919
 

1479
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,679
 the thing is it's not really it's not

1480
00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:33,679
 

1481
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,720
 really enough to motivate

1482
00:28:33,669 --> 00:28:36,720
 

1483
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:40,000
 it's um it's about engagement

1484
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:40,000
 

1485
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:42,960
 more okay it's about engaging uh

1486
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:42,960
 

1487
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,240
 people rather than just talking about

1488
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,240
 

1489
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:48,480
 motivation

1490
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:48,480
 

1491
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:52,000
 and to engage people um i look at what

1492
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:52,000
 

1493
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:55,200
 as well engages me and it's usually to

1494
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:55,200
 

1495
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 to have a sense in the work that i do to

1496
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:58,000
 

1497
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:01,600
 find that the work that i do

1498
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:01,600
 

1499
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,559
 has some sense and that i have this

1500
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:04,559
 

1501
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,880
 vision there's a vision tools which i

1502
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:04,880
 

1503
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:08,000
 can

1504
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:08,000
 

1505
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,720

 work day

1508

1509
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,360
 it's just not like a list of tasks and

1510
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:13,360
 

1511
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,320

1512
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,320
 

1513
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,600

1514
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:17,600
 

1515
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:21,440

1525
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:38,880
 be able to influence my own work

1529
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:46,159
 um moving motivators is one of the games

1530
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:46,159
 

1531
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:48,640

00:29:46,149 --> 00:29:48,640
 

1533
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:52,240
 at the end of the day it is more giving

1534
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:52,240
 

1535
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:55,440
 a vision giving sense to someone

1539
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:02,559
 just a slight recognition uh can take us

1540
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:02,559
 

1541
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,440
 much much further um if i take for

1542
00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:03,440
 

1543
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,080
 example

1544
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:06,080

1552
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:14,240
 

1553
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,440

1629
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:33,519
 weekly scheduled coffee meetings to

1630
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:33,519
 

1631
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:36,000

1645
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:54,559
 um otherwise for energizing it's just

1646
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:54,559
 

1647
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:57,120

1673
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,080

00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,840
 

1683
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,559

 about it as well

1700

1701
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:55,360
 and um by putting in place this

1702
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:55,360
 

1703
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,960
 is matrix it really helped me

1704
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,960
 

1705
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,480
 you know making the difference in

1706
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:58,480
 

1707
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,120
 between uh

1708
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:01,120
 

1709
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,760
 what was urgent right now but why was it

1710
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:01,760
 

1711
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,679
 urgent

1712
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,679
 

1713
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,200
 just because there was a deadline just

1714
00:33:03,669 --> 00:33:05,200
 

1715
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,000
 because there was a deadline for

1716
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,000
 

1717
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,200
 tomorrow

1718
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:09,200
 

1719
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,640
 and then in my in my brain without

1720
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:10,640
 

1721
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,960
 thinking too much about it

1722
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:12,960
 

1723
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,559
 because the deadline was for tomorrow

1724
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,559
 

1725
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,720
 that was the most urgent that's

1726
00:33:14,549 --> 00:33:16,720
 

1727
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,720
 what i had to go and work on well

1728
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,720
 

1729
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,519
 actually no because there were some

1730
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:21,519
 

1731
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,320
 tasks that were really requiring me and

1732
00:33:21,509 --> 00:33:22,320
 

1733
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:25,440
 that were

1734
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:25,440
 

1735
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,919
 more risky and the impact could have

1736
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:25,919
 

1737
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,159
 been

1738
00:33:25,909 --> 00:33:28,159
 

1739
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,279
 much much bigger even though the

1740
00:33:28,149 --> 00:33:29,279
 

1741
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:32,080
 deadline was

1742
00:33:29,269 --> 00:33:32,080
 

1743
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,080
 much further

1744
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:33,190
