00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,960
 

263
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,160

00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,280
 

271
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:11,840

 so either people are not typing or i'm

278
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,880
 

279
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,639
 not seeing it i don't think it would be

280
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,639
 

281
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,880
 under direct messages would it

282
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:28,880
 

283
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,880
 nope

284
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:30,950
 

285
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,120

00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,120
 

287
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,440
 rebecca

288
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,440
 

289
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,600
 pretty good not all teams are up to

290
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,600
 

291
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,360
 speed on agile on agile okay so that

292
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,360
 

293
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,400
 sounds like a um

294
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:44,400
 

295
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,840
 you know spreading knowledge issue

296
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,840
 

297
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,600
 right getting it across to everyone in

298
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,600
 

299
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,280
 the organization so they can start using

300
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,280
 

301
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,639
 it and benefiting it

302
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:52,639
 

303
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,680
 no understanding from business what

304
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:54,680
 

305
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,039
 block funding truly means they're

306
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,039
 

307
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,919
 disbanding the teams part way through

308
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:57,919
 

309
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,520
 the year

310
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:59,520
 

311
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,680
 so i wonder if that means they're giving

312
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,680
 

313
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:05,280
 up early they're putting teams together

314
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:05,280
 

315
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,280
 but they're not keeping them consistent

316
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:05,510
 

317
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,919
 what else what other things come up for

318
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,919
 

319
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,039
 you guys when you think about how

320
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:11,039
 

321
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,039
 agile's working for you

322
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:13,510
 

323
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,280
 teams are new to agile absolutely

324
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:18,150
 

325
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,240

331
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,759
 huge amount of shifting of priorities

332
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,759

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,919

335
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,440
 leadership refuses to change mindset and

336
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:39,440
 

337
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,800

343
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,560
 causing too many false starts and

344
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:48,560
 

345
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:50,240

349
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,639
 bad waterfall habits leadership refuses

359
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,160
 multiple projects to be handled by one

360
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,160

00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,560
 

411
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,039
 agility

412
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,039
 

413
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,599
 is it you know there's over 30 different

414
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:07,599
 

415
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,120
 ways

416
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:11,120
 

417
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:14,319
 of doing a job you know it ranges from

418
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:14,319
 

419
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,720
 a to u and the good news is if you want

420
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:14,720
 

421
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,440
 to

422
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:17,440
 

423
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,840
 put to make your own one up there's

424
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:17,840
 

425
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,120
 still

426
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,120
 

427
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:24,800
 v through to z left um

428
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:24,800
 

429
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:27,199
 the status quo of one size fits all so

430
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:27,199
 

431
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,479
 we're still stuck in the industrial age

432
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:28,479
 

433
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,520
 of thinking

434
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:31,520
 

435
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,479
 um and then there's the analysts you

436
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,479
 

437
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,200
 know

438
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:35,200
 

439
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,839
 following the framework but not uh

440
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:35,839
 

441
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,760
 taking

442
00:08:35,829 --> 00:08:37,760
 

443
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,560
 the essence of what agile's actually

444
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,560
 

445
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,680
 about and then there's the

446
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:43,680
 

447
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:47,279
 attempting to scale simplicity

448
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:47,279
 

449
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:50,080
 and just using simplicity um

450
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:50,080
 

451
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:55,279
 in a way that it's not meant for

452
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:55,279
 

453
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:57,839
 different types of teams

454
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:57,839
 

455
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,440
 okay chris i'll take it back to you and

456
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,440
 

457
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:03,440
 i will

458
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:03,440
 

459
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,440
 start sliding in thank you

460
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:03,509
 

461
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,480
 let's try to keep the slide deck can and

462
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,480
 

463
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,920
 maximize so that we don't lose

464
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:09,920
 

465
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,680
 yeah the trouble i've got is switching

466
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,680
 

467
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,720
 to my so i'm going to mute myself chris

468
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,720
 

469
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,640
 and you just carry on

470
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:16,640
 

471
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,640
 and i'll just keep the slides going okay

472
00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:20,829
 

473
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,839
 great

474
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:25,509
 

475
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,560
 and then just flip to the next slide so

476
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,560
 

477
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,000
 let's talk about the root causes and

478
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,000
 

479
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,360
 beliefs really quickly

480
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,360
 

481
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,959
 one of the big problems that we have and

482
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,959
 

483
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,279
 i think someone mentioned this is that

484
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:33,279
 

485
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,800
 in

486
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:36,800
 

487
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,760
 groups at scale we risk we resist risk

488
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:37,760
 

489
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,519
 and uncertainty

490
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,519
 

491
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,040
 nobody wants to be the person who sinks

492
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:41,040
 

493
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,320
 the entire boat

494
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,320
 

495
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,360
 no one wants to be the one who makes

496
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:45,360
 

497
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,880
 that call that costs all the money or or

498
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,880
 

499
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,560
 creates bad news for shareholders but

500
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,560
 

501
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,880
 the fallacy is that more planning and

502
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:48,880
 

503
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,959
 more

504
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,959
 

505
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,080
 waiting more analyzing more discussing

506
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:52,080
 

507
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,680
 more training

508
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,680
 

509
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,920
 will bring us more certainty and one of

510
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,920
 

511
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,920
 you mentioned certainty as well

512
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,920
 

513
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,680
 the truth is unless you're really good

514
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,680
 

515
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,279
 at predicting the future there's no such

516
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,279
 

517
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,160
 thing as certainty we can try to get

518
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:02,160
 

519
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,560
 closer but

520
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,560
 

521
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,320
 most of the time are efforts to try to

522
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,320
 

523
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,240
 get more certainty or in vain

524
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,240
 

525
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,240
 it's natural to want to avoid the

526
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,240
 

527
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,760
 decision to act because

528
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,760
 

529
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,279
 we don't want to expose ourselves to the

530
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,279
 

531
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,000
 risk of the downside

532
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:16,000
 

533
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:18,079
 so often we see things like frameworks

534
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,079
 

535
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,560
 solutions tweaks hacks memes

536
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:20,560
 

537
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,120
 trends all of these things that we lean

538
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,120
 

539
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,880
 on

540
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,880
 

541
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,279
 to try to get a better understanding of

542
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:25,279
 

543
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,079
 what will make us more consistently

544
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:28,079
 

545
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,920
 successful the problem is all of those

546
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:29,920
 

547
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,560
 things complicate the playing field

548
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,560
 

549
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,560
 more information is not better it

550
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,560
 

551
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,640
 doesn't help you become more tactical

552
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,640
 

553
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,240
 if anything it confuses the playing

554
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,240
 

555
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,600
 field and helps you differ

556
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,600
 

557
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,519
 action so flip the slide if you would

558
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,519
 

559
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,200
 greg

560
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:43,200
 

561
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,560
 now that's a natural response again

562
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,560
 

563
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,000
 especially at scale

564
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,000
 

565
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,519
 so we don't want to judge that we don't

566
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,519
 

567
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,880
 want to put a negative label on that but

568
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:48,880
 

569
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,320
 it is what it is

570
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,320
 

571
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,360
 it's going to make it challenging for

572
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:53,360
 

573
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,760
 leaders to choose to activate

574
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,760
 

575
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,279
 in agile the way we really want them to

576
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,279
 

577
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,640
 and if they don't activate that way

578
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:58,640
 

579
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,640
 they'll never get

580
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,640
 

581
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,920
 the full benefit so here's what i want

582
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,920
 

583
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,160
 to encourage you to do

584
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,160
 

585
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,839
 i want you to draw your attention to the

586
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,839
 

587
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,240
 things about agile

588
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:08,240
 

589
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,920
 that are fundamental what parts of

590
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,920
 

591
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,040
 agility are the dribbling

592
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:13,040
 

593
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:15,040
 of the ball in basketball the things

594
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,040
 

595
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,839
 that if you practice them and practice

596
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,839
 

597
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,760
 them well

598
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:17,760
 

599
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,760
 it will never fail you it will continue

600
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,760
 

601
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,680
 to serve you

602
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,680
 

603
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,360
 the minute you try to get fancy there's

604
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,360
 

605
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,480
 a saying that morgan spurlock the guy

606
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,480
 

607
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,160
 who made the movie

608
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,160
 

609
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,160
 supersize me has that the minute you try

610
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,160
 

611
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,600
 to get fancy fancy gets broken and i

612
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,600
 

613
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,399
 think we've all experienced that we've

614
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,399
 

615
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,160
 all

616
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:32,160
 

617
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,680
 been in situations where you try to get

618
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,680
 

619
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,800
 ultra complicated

620
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:36,800
 

621
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,560
 and at speed the whole thing comes apart

622
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,560
 

623
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,360
 on you so we want to stick with

624
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:41,360
 

625
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,160
 and look at fundamentals much of our

626
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,160
 

627
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,240
 problem with

628
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,240
 

629
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,000
 implementing agility is our belief that

630
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,000
 

631
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,240
 it can't be that simple

632
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,240
 

633
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,200
 the truth of the matter is all

634
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,200
 

635
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,440
 philosophies

636
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,440
 

637
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,440
 all religions all schools of thought

638
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:53,440
 

639
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,399
 have a notion of you have to balance

640
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,399
 

641
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,279
 between simple

642
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:57,279
 

643
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,120
 and complex nothing is always simple

644
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:59,120
 

645
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,399
 nothing is always complex but if we

646
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,399
 

647
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,240
 ignore the simple

648
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:02,240
 

649
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,079
 and treat everything like it's a 500

650
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:04,079
 

651
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,519
 page book that you have to learn before

652
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:05,519
 

653
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,680
 you start to use it

654
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:07,680
 

655
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,519
 guess what happens it's important to

656
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,519
 

657
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,040
 focus on effectiveness at the ground

658
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:11,040
 

659
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,160
 floor first the dribbling of the

660
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,160
 

661
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,639
 basketball

662
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,639
 

663
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,160
 what are those things in agile those

664
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:16,160
 

665
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,120
 things are not the rules they're not the

666
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,120
 

667
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,399
 ceremonies

668
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,399
 

669
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,200
 they're things like keeping your

670
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:21,200
 

671
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,720
 commitments communicating effectively

672
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:22,720
 

673
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,959
 directly

674
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,959
 

675
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,240
 prioritizing properly if we can't do

676
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:26,240
 

677
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,760
 those things right

678
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,760
 

679
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,480
 none of the advanced stuff that you

680
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,480
 

681
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,360
 learn about in a master scrum program or

682
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,360
 

683
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,920
 a scaling

684
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,920
 

685
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,839
 framework are going to help you sports

686
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,839
 

687
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,040
 and military teams drill on fundamentals

688
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:37,040
 

689
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,920
 to perfection

690
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,920
 

691
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,519
 for a reason because if you rehearse the

692
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,519
 

693
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,800
 core skills

694
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:42,800
 

695
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,560
 to the point where they're committed to

696
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,560
 

697
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,120
 muscle memory then they're available to

698
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,120
 

699
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,800
 you

700
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,800
 

701
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,399
 when things get stressful when things

702
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,399
 

703
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,880
 get unpredictable

704
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:50,880
 

705
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,000
 when things get risky we want to be able

706
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,000
 

707
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,480
 to draw on those things

708
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:54,480
 

709
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,079
 picture a piano player who goes up on

710
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,079
 

711
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,120
 stage and is all of a sudden faced with

712
00:12:56,069 --> 00:12:57,120
 

713
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,360
 the nerves

714
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,360
 

715
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,240
 and the tension of being in front of an

716
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,240
 

717
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,240
 audience where

718
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,240
 

719
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,279
 failure is magnified in front of

720
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,279
 

721
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,839
 thousands of people

722
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:05,839
 

723
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,399
 that's going to affect your ability to

724
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:06,399
 

725
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,839
 play

726
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:07,839
 

727
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,920
 as well as you do in the plot in the

728
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,920
 

729
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,440
 practice room so the more you practice

730
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,440
 

731
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,959
 the more you rehearse it the more it's

732
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,959
 

733
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,200
 committed to muscle memory

734
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:15,200
 

735
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,800
 the more it's available to you when you

736
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,800
 

737
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,079
 need it in performance

738
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:20,079
 

739
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,760
 flip the slide if you would so how do we

740
00:13:20,069 --> 00:13:21,760
 

741
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,440
 implement those things let's take a

742
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,440
 

743
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,959
 moment can we get a copy of the slides

744
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,959
 

745
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,560
 um

746
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:26,560
 

747
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,200
 monica is that something we can send out

748
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:29,200
 

749
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:32,240
 now or do we want to do it

750
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:32,240
 

751
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,720
 do you want to do it at the end

752
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,720
 

753
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,720
 we can if you have them posted somewhere

754
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,720
 

755
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,480
 we can uh either send a link

756
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,480
 

757
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,399
 later or i think at the end of the

758
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:40,399
 

759
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,519
 conference we can post them

760
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:43,519
 

761
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:46,399
 awesome okay

762
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:46,399
 

763
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,760
 from my experience working with athletes

764
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:47,760
 

765
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,000
 working with performers

766
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,000
 

767
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,839
 working with writers working with

768
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,839
 

769
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,639
 special operators in the united states

770
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:52,639
 

771
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,320
 military

772
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:54,320
 

773
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,160
 there's a certain number of elite

774
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:56,160
 

775
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,240
 mindsets and behaviors

776
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,240
 

777
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,639
 that you see repeated over and over and

778
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,639
 

779
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,959
 you have to look closely to find them

780
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:02,959
 

781
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,760
 here's what they are people who do well

782
00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:03,760
 

783
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,560
 in every

784
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,560
 

785
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,320
 realm and every arena are visionary

786
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,320
 

787
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,839
 people and they're service oriented i'll

788
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:09,839
 

789
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,959
 go into detail on these in a couple

790
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:10,959
 

791
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,880
 minutes so i'm going to spin through

792
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:12,880
 

793
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,360
 them really quickly

794
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:15,360
 

795
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,839
 they can prioritize and focus extremely

796
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,839
 

797
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,680
 well it's like a superpower to them

798
00:14:17,829 --> 00:14:19,680
 

799
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,360
 they encourage failure rather than

800
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,360
 

801
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,639
 upfront planning so they don't

802
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:24,639
 

803
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,639
 need things to be perfect the first time

804
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:26,639
 

805
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,160
 they're learning organizations they're

806
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:28,160
 

807
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,839
 learning organisms

808
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,839
 

809
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,600
 they place therefore very little value

810
00:14:29,829 --> 00:14:31,600
 

811
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,079
 on certainty and safety

812
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:34,079
 

813
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,440
 they prefer to observe orient decide act

814
00:14:34,069 --> 00:14:35,440
 

815
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,720
 and that includes failing

816
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:38,720
 

817
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,079
 i call that whole thing leaping

818
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,079
 

819
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,320
 they expect members to lead in the

820
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:42,320
 

821
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,000
 absence of orders and certainty

822
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:44,000
 

823
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,839
 they continuously inspect and adapt

824
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,839
 

825
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,480
 their own performance and that of other

826
00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:46,480
 

827
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,800
 people

828
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,800
 

829
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,360
 they thrive where others fear to go

830
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:51,360
 

831
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,360
 sometimes we call that courage

832
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,360
 

833
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,720
 but it is shocking to me in my extensive

834
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,720
 

835
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,399
 work with people

836
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,399
 

837
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,040
 that i would say less than five percent

838
00:14:56,389 --> 00:14:59,040
 

839
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:01,600
 of the people i meet are willing to do

840
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,600
 

841
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,720
 what others won't so that they can have

842
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:02,720
 

843
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,839
 tomorrow

844
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:05,839
 

845
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,839
 what others can't

846
00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:06,069
 

847
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,480
 they also build excellent habits which

848
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:10,480
 

849
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,279
 means that they do

850
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,279
 

851
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,000
 right things consistently in small

852
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:14,000
 

853
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,000
 increments

854
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:16,000
 

855
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,760
 over time they're always moving forward

856
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,760
 

857
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,600
 in tiny tiny increments

858
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,600
 

859
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,440
 so let's learn how we apply these now to

860
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,440
 

861
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,199
 what we know about agile and scrum flip

862
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:23,199
 

863
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,199
 the slide if you would greg

864
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:25,199
 

865
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:27,839
 in badass agile we have a four-point

866
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:27,839
 

867
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,839
 system

868
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:28,310
 

869
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,800
 which i call the badass agile way and it

870
00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:32,800
 

871
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:35,040
 consists of four components number one

872
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:35,040
 

873
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,639
 get visionary number two get focused

874
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,639
 

875
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,040
 number three get greedy

876
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:39,040
 

877
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,399
 number four get humble and get flexible

878
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,399
 

879
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,320
 let me show you how these pin out to

880
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:42,320
 

881
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,519
 agile values and practices

882
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:45,519
 

883
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,120
 flip the slide if you would the first

884
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:47,120
 

885
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,959
 one is visionary now visionary doesn't

886
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,959
 

887
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,000
 mean you have to be elon musk or steve

888
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:50,000
 

889
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,920
 jobs

890
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,920
 

891
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,759
 but it does mean you have to know where

892
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,759
 

893
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,759
 you're going you would never get into a

894
00:15:53,749 --> 00:15:55,759
 

895
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,600
 car

896
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:57,600
 

897
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,279
 and go someplace you'd never been before

898
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,279
 

899
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,399
 without telling your gps where you're

900
00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:00,399
 

901
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,320
 headed

902
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:02,320
 

903
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,680
 because if you don't do that you're

904
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,680
 

905
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,560
 going to drive for a while you're going

906
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,560
 

907
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,839
 to go on luck

908
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,839
 

909
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,800
 or going to go on instinct but

910
00:16:06,829 --> 00:16:08,800
 

911
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,920
 eventually you're going to end up going

912
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:09,920
 

913
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,800
 in the wrong direction and you're going

914
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:10,800
 

915
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,160
 to waste

916
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:14,160
 

917
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,040
 time so it's useful to ask the question

918
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,040
 

919
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,079
 what are we doing

920
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:18,079
 

921
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:20,000
 why are we doing this why are we here

922
00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:20,000
 

923
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,360
 for me i have a vision that describes my

924
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,360
 

925
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,360
 life it's pretty simple the last

926
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,360
 

927
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,040
 sentence of it says to create heroes i

928
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,040
 

929
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,000
 like creating people of grit and

930
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,000
 

931
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,000
 character

932
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,000
 

933
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,160
 people of meaning people who intend to

934
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:30,160
 

935
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,480
 make positive change in the world

936
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,480
 

937
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,079
 but that doesn't have to be your vision

938
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,079
 

939
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,680
 your company probably has a vision you

940
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:35,680
 

941
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,800
 want to try a fun experiment

942
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,800
 

943
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,320
 next time you're speaking in front of

944
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,320
 

945
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,440
 your company ask people to raise their

946
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,440
 

947
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,399
 hands how many people know what your

948
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:40,399
 

949
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,000
 company's vision

950
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:44,000
 

951
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:47,360
 is some hands will go up then

952
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:47,360
 

953
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,279
 ask them who can repeat it and hands go

954
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,279
 

955
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,720
 down

956
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:50,720
 

957
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,360
 of the hands that are remaining ask

958
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,360
 

959
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,920
 those people who among you has a vision

960
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:55,920
 

961
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,920
 for yourself

962
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:56,949
 

963
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,320
 it's shocking how many people don't

964
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,320
 

965
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,759
 really have a particular destination in

966
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,759
 

967
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,519
 mind and i want you to flip that

968
00:17:01,749 --> 00:17:03,519
 

969
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,880
 i want you to be intentional in all that

970
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:04,880
 

971
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:08,400
 you do now isn't this

972
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:08,400
 

973
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:12,640
 true in agile don't we say

974
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:12,640
 

975
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:15,839
 what is the sprint sorry the sprinkle

976
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,839
 

977
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:18,160
 what is the product vision what is

978
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:18,160
 

979
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,919
 the definition of done all of those

980
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,919
 

981
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,640
 tools and instruments that we use within

982
00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:20,640
 

983
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,919
 agility

984
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:23,919
 

985
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,039
 are a way of saying here is where we're

986
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:25,039
 

987
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,559
 going

988
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:26,559
 

989
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,880
 here's what i want to build and here's

990
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:28,880
 

991
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:31,520
 what it looks like when it's done right

992
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:31,520
 

993
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,799
 so i want you to start thinking about

994
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,799
 

995
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,559
 vision

996
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:34,559
 

997
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,320
 and it matters less if you have one for

998
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:36,320
 

999
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,320
 yourself right away but make sure that

1000
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,320
 

1001
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,760
 you know what the commander's intent is

1002
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,760
 

1003
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,080
 if you're working on a product

1004
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,080
 

1005
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:47,840
 what's the vision for that product flip

1006
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:47,840
 

1007
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,840
 the slide if you would greg

1008
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:51,190
 

1009
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,039
 the next question you can ask that makes

1010
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,039
 

1011
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,480
 visioning simpler

1012
00:17:55,029 --> 00:17:56,480
 

1013
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,240
 because if i ask people to come up with

1014
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,240
 

1015
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,000
 a vision it's a little bit cloudy it can

1016
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,000
 

1017
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,760
 be hard for people to really nail one

1018
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:01,760
 

1019
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,360
 but sometimes it's useful to say who do

1020
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,360
 

1021
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,799
 you serve how do you serve them and why

1022
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,799
 

1023
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,039
 do you care

1024
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:07,039
 

1025
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,559
 service is one of the quickest ways to

1026
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:08,559
 

1027
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,679
 ensure that your vision whatever it

1028
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:09,679
 

1029
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,760
 might be

1030
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:11,760
 

1031
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,160
 is easily recruitable what i mean by

1032
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,160
 

1033
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,280
 that is it's easy to get other people to

1034
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,280
 

1035
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,760
 sign in

1036
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,760
 

1037
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,440
 to working towards your vision with you

1038
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,440
 

1039
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,799
 if your vision is inherently selfish

1040
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,799
 

1041
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,880
 like i'm doing this because i want to

1042
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:22,880
 

1043
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,000
 make money so i can buy a ferrari

1044
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,000
 

1045
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,240
 people are going to have a hard time

1046
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:26,240
 

1047
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,720
 figuring what's in it for them

1048
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,720
 

1049
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,840
 but if your vision serves veterans or if

1050
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:29,840
 

1051
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,559
 it serves

1052
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:32,559
 

1053
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,720
 um senior citizens or if it serves a

1054
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:34,720
 

1055
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:37,280
 particular user community

1056
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:37,280
 

1057
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,960
 if it serves people in need people with

1058
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,960
 

1059
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,960
 challenges if it serves a certain

1060
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,960
 

1061
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,000
 segment of your customer base it's

1062
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,000
 

1063
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,440
 easier to visualize

1064
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,440
 

1065
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,120
 the people that you're helping and once

1066
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:45,120
 

1067
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,960
 you can visualize them

1068
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,960
 

1069
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,799
 you can picture them using your product

1070
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,799
 

1071
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,039
 you can see what they value

1072
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:51,039
 

1073
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:53,200
 and what they benefit and if you can

1074
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:53,200
 

1075
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,880
 connect with that vision it's so much

1076
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,880
 

1077
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,600
 easier isn't it

1078
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:57,600
 

1079
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,880
 to make daily decisions should i work on

1080
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,880
 

1081
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,440
 this today well i don't know

1082
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:01,440
 

1083
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,880
 who do we serve how do we serve them and

1084
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:02,880
 

1085
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,160
 why do we care

1086
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,160
 

1087
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,080
 well we serve that segment of the

1088
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,080
 

1089
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,400
 customer population that feels

1090
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:08,400
 

1091
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,360
 like we don't care about them we're

1092
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,360
 

1093
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,960
 trying to make them feel

1094
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,960
 

1095
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,880
 human today we're trying to make them

1096
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,880
 

1097
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,320
 feel valued

1098
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,320
 

1099
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,080
 and we do that by giving them something

1100
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:16,080
 

1101
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,799
 a little extra a discount

1102
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,799
 

1103
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,840
 a bonus something to make them feel like

1104
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:19,840
 

1105
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,520
 they matter

1106
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,520
 

1107
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,440
 when you can describe what you're doing

1108
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,440
 

1109
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,520
 in those terms it's easy to say

1110
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,520
 

1111
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,720
 should i work on this today or work on

1112
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,720
 

1113
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,200
 this today

1114
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:29,200
 

1115
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,039
 which one gets you closer to achieving

1116
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:31,039
 

1117
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,120
 that vision

1118
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:33,120
 

1119
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:35,280
 now in agile we would call that backlog

1120
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,280
 

1121
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,080
 prioritization but how many times do we

1122
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,080
 

1123
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,240
 struggle

1124
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,240
 

1125
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,080
 because when we prioritize the backlog

1126
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:40,080
 

1127
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,440
 we put things up at the top

1128
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:43,440
 

1129
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:47,280
 that are easy cheap faster

1130
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:47,280
 

1131
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,480
 or on fire yes

1132
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,480
 

1133
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,400
 if you can relate to that go ahead and

1134
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,400
 

1135
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,840
 type in the comments yep that's me but

1136
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,840
 

1137
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,440
 if we were to just change the script

1138
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:55,440
 

1139
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:58,400
 instead and say that value is defined

1140
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:58,400
 

1141
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,480
 by who you serve how you serve them and

1142
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:00,480
 

1143
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,000
 why we care

1144
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,000
 

1145
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,840
 we can make a ton of difference so flip

1146
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,840
 

1147
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,200
 if you would um greg to the next slide

1148
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,200
 

1149
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,720
 please

1150
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,720
 

1151
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,960
 so what i'm saying in this section that

1152
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,960
 

1153
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,640
 i want you to do is i want you to begin

1154
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,640
 

1155
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,720
 everything you do with intention today

1156
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,720
 

1157
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,320
 you may not personally set the vision

1158
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,320
 

1159
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,240
 for your product for your project for

1160
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,240
 

1161
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,440
 your company

1162
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,440
 

1163
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,440
 it's good to know what they are it's

1164
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:19,440
 

1165
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,559
 good to be aligned with it but you

1166
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,559
 

1167
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,159
 personally

1168
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:22,159
 

1169
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,000
 can also make a big difference for your

1170
00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:24,000
 

1171
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,120
 teams by beginning everything with

1172
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,120
 

1173
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,200
 intention

1174
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:27,200
 

1175
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,559
 as i begin this particular session today

1176
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,559
 

1177
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,000
 i know who i'm reaching

1178
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:30,000
 

1179
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,559
 i know how i want to help you and i know

1180
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:32,559
 

1181
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,159
 why i care but do we do that before we

1182
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:34,159
 

1183
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,000
 go into a meeting

1184
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:36,000
 

1185
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,960
 so for example we're about to go into a

1186
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:36,960
 

1187
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,159
 one-hour meeting great what are you

1188
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,159
 

1189
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,840
 going to get out of that meeting i don't

1190
00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:39,840
 

1191
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,799
 know then why are you going

1192
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:42,799
 

1193
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,559
 because it's at 2 p.m when we talk about

1194
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:44,559
 

1195
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,400
 reducing waste and agile isn't that what

1196
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:46,400
 

1197
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:49,200
 we're talking about really

1198
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:49,200
 

1199
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,799
 we're talking about not ignoring certain

1200
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,799
 

1201
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,360
 kinds of work because we can't

1202
00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:53,360
 

1203
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,880
 make time for it we are ignoring those

1204
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,880
 

1205
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,880
 things that don't contribute

1206
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:58,880
 

1207
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:00,880
 massive value to the mission

1208
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,880
 

1209
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,080
 so when i say be intentional i'm asking

1210
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,080
 

1211
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,480
 you start every week every day

1212
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:04,480
 

1213
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,360
 every interaction everything you do with

1214
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,360
 

1215
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,880
 an intention

1216
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:08,880
 

1217
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,159
 what will you have or create at the end

1218
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,159
 

1219
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,240
 of this encounter

1220
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:12,240
 

1221
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,520
 or this slice of time that didn't exist

1222
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,520
 

1223
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,799
 before

1224
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,799
 

1225
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,360
 and how does this move you closer to

1226
00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:17,360
 

1227
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:19,039
 your goal so that's number one be

1228
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,039
 

1229
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,400
 visionary that's a fundamental that i

1230
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:20,400
 

1231
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,320
 want you to practice

1232
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,320
 

1233
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:31,679
 and see what kind of difference it makes

1234
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:31,679
 

1235
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:33,919
 flip the slide if you would greg

1236
00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:33,919
 

1237
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,039
 next is get focused well one of the

1238
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:35,039
 

1239
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,760
 hardest things to

1240
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:37,760
 

1241
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:39,440
 inculcate in people is discipline it's a

1242
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,440
 

1243
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,880
 bit of a lost art isn't it

1244
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:40,880
 

1245
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,799
 we've got these things constantly

1246
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,799
 

1247
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,600
 beeping and blipping and competing for

1248
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:43,600
 

1249
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,960
 our attention

1250
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,960
 

1251
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,799
 intentionally competing for our

1252
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,799
 

1253
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,480
 intention we've got sidebar

1254
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:48,480
 

1255
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:51,039
 conversations we've got

1256
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:51,039
 

1257
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,640
 oh shiny object syndrome as we're coding

1258
00:21:51,029 --> 00:21:52,640
 

1259
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,240
 away or as we're working

1260
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,240
 

1261
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,159
 it's really difficult to get focused

1262
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,159
 

1263
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,159
 however sad to report

1264
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:58,159
 

1265
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,760
 that one of the master skills of highly

1266
00:21:58,149 --> 00:21:59,760
 

1267
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,760
 successful effective teams and

1268
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,760
 

1269
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,520
 individuals is the ability to get

1270
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,520
 

1271
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,240
 focused and to stay there

1272
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:06,240
 

1273
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,840
 the good news is you don't need much of

1274
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:07,840
 

1275
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,919
 it to be effective

1276
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,919
 

1277
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,880
 get focused can mean a lot of different

1278
00:22:09,909 --> 00:22:10,880
 

1279
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,080
 things

1280
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:14,080
 

1281
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:18,960
 a badass approaches a big complex

1282
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:18,960
 

1283
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:21,039
 giant ball of work or uncertainty

1284
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:21,039
 

1285
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,799
 without getting overwhelmed without

1286
00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:22,799
 

1287
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,320
 looking at it and saying uh

1288
00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:24,320
 

1289
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:27,120
 gotta clean the gutters did you ever get

1290
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:27,120
 

1291
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,000
 that you can register in chats let me

1292
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,000
 

1293
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,559
 know if you

1294
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:30,559
 

1295
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,080
 are guilty of occasionally walking away

1296
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,080
 

1297
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,840
 from the work at hand

1298
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,840
 

1299
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,120
 because it's too big and it's too scary

1300
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,120
 

1301
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,039
 how often does that affect our

1302
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:37,039
 

1303
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,520
 productivity so we work on things that

1304
00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:37,520
 

1305
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,400
 don't

1306
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:40,400
 

1307
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:42,240
 matter instead chime in if that's you

1308
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:42,240
 

1309
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,080
 edwin says yes

1310
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:44,080
 

1311
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,760
 nothing to be ashamed of it's natural

1312
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,760
 

1313
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,720
 what we want to do is there's a couple

1314
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,720
 

1315
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,039
 things we can do

1316
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:49,039
 

1317
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,760
 break big things into smaller measurable

1318
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:49,760
 

1319
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,760
 pieces

1320
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,760
 

1321
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,039
 if i say to you isabel you for sure

1322
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,039
 

1323
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,480
 you've been there right

1324
00:22:53,029 --> 00:22:54,480
 

1325
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,559
 if i say to you isabelle do a thousand

1326
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,559
 

1327
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:00,400
 push-ups for me you're gonna be like

1328
00:22:56,549 --> 00:23:00,400
 

1329
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:02,320
 um you know i'm not sure i can do ten

1330
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:02,320
 

1331
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,320
 and i certainly don't want the world to

1332
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,320
 

1333
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,760
 see that i can't do five well the thing

1334
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,760
 

1335
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,880
 is i never asked you to do a thousand in

1336
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:06,880
 

1337
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,120
 a row

1338
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:09,120
 

1339
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,640
 all i'm saying is let's do a thousand

1340
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,640
 

1341
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,600
 now that could mean do five

1342
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:13,600
 

1343
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,159
 stop wait for ten minutes do another

1344
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,159
 

1345
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,799
 five

1346
00:23:14,149 --> 00:23:16,799
 

1347
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,000
 you will eventually by definition the

1348
00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:18,000
 

1349
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,919
 math will tell you we'll get to a

1350
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:19,919
 

1351
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,840
 thousand eventually the goal is not to

1352
00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:21,840
 

1353
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:25,280
 get to a thousand in a row for

1354
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:25,280
 

1355
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:29,600
 time the goal is to persist

1356
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:29,600
 

1357
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:31,039
 through a thousand overwhelm

1358
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,039
 

1359
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,799
 the feeling that we should walk away

1360
00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:32,799
 

1361
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,919
 from a task when it's too big too scary

1362
00:23:32,789 --> 00:23:33,919
 

1363
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,640
 not doable

1364
00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:36,640
 

1365
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,600
 unsure uncertain is one of the reasons

1366
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:37,600
 

1367
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,360
 why we allow

1368
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,360
 

1369
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,279
 distractions to sway us in different

1370
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,279
 

1371
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,400
 directions but by breaking a big thing

1372
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:44,400
 

1373
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:46,880
 into a smaller piece

1374
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,880
 

1375
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,400
 it changes things for example this very

1376
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:48,400
 

1377
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,120
 presentation when we first started

1378
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,120
 

1379
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,480
 planning it

1380
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,480
 

1381
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,080
 we had all these ideas we're going to

1382
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,080
 

1383
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,360
 have zoom rooms and breakouts and people

1384
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,360
 

1385
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,640
 will do this and we're going to find a

1386
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,640
 

1387
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,400
 way to give out candy and we're going to

1388
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:56,400
 

1389
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,240
 have all these flashy titles

1390
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:58,240
 

1391
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,760
 and all these beautiful things as we get

1392
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,760
 

1393
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,039
 closer to the deadline we realize we

1394
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,039
 

1395
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,440
 can't

1396
00:24:01,029 --> 00:24:03,440
 

1397
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:06,000
 and in fact that big vision of what it

1398
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:06,000
 

1399
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,559
 could be or what it should be

1400
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:08,559
 

1401
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,240
 might have created some tension where we

1402
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:10,240
 

1403
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:12,720
 avoided starting because it's like this

1404
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:12,720
 

1405
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,640
 is too big

1406
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,640
 

1407
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,240
 on the other hand if we say listen i'm

1408
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:16,240
 

1409
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,679
 not sure if i can get to all of those

1410
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,679
 

1411
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,279
 things but i know

1412
00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:19,279
 

1413
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,720
 that i want the presentation to have the

1414
00:24:19,269 --> 00:24:20,720
 

1415
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,880
 following qualities

1416
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,880
 

1417
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,919
 i know that i want this if i never get

1418
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:25,919
 

1419
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:28,240
 to this it's not the end of the world

1420
00:24:25,909 --> 00:24:28,240
 

1421
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,600
 you see when we have backlogs that are

1422
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,600
 

1423
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,279
 full of things

1424
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:31,279
 

1425
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,840
 every idea that pops into our head every

1426
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:33,840
 

1427
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:35,600
 feature we may possibly want to address

1428
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,600
 

1429
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,640
 we run the risk of having so much stuff

1430
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:38,640
 

1431
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:42,080
 in there that we overwhelm ourselves

1432
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:42,080
 

1433
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:44,480
 in fact maintaining the backlog itself

1434
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:44,480
 

1435
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:47,520
 becomes such a big piece of pie that we

1436
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:47,520
 

1437
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,600
 don't want to dig into it

1438
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:49,600
 

1439
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,279
 the secret is to focus on the things

1440
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,279
 

1441
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,000
 that matter most

1442
00:24:51,269 --> 00:24:54,000
 

1443
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:56,000
 dig in this means planning minimally

1444
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:56,000
 

1445
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,520
 just enough to get moving and adapt as

1446
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,520
 

1447
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,640
 you go what if i picked the wrong thing

1448
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,640
 

1449
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,320
 to work on first

1450
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:02,320
 

1451
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:04,720
 so what if you make it small enough

1452
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:04,720
 

1453
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,840
 you might fail you might say oops spent

1454
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:05,840
 

1455
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,960
 my time on the wrong thing

1456
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:08,960
 

1457
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,799
 i still do this every day whatever my

1458
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,799
 

1459
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,760
 sales or marketing whatever efforts may

1460
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:11,760
 

1461
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,279
 be

1462
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,279
 

1463
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,720
 i may sit there get distracted on

1464
00:25:13,269 --> 00:25:14,720
 

1465
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,640
 something and say you know learning a

1466
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:16,640
 

1467
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,080
 new crm wasn't really the most important

1468
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:18,080
 

1469
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,760
 thing

1470
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,760
 

1471
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,080
 but i got distracted at the prospect of

1472
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,080
 

1473
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,799
 a new toy

1474
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:24,799
 

1475
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,159
 no big deal why because i set 25-minute

1476
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:26,159
 

1477
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,480
 timers when i work

1478
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:28,480
 

1479
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,279
 i work for 25 minutes stop reassess

1480
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,279
 

1481
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,880
 reevaluate

1482
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:30,880
 

1483
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,880
 see if the priorities around me have

1484
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:32,880
 

1485
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,240
 changed it's at this point where it's

1486
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,240
 

1487
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,240
 okay to check your email and say is

1488
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:36,240
 

1489
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,799
 there anything burning or pressing

1490
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:38,799
 

1491
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,799
 that i have to address a support ticket

1492
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:40,799
 

1493
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,799
 that sort of thing

1494
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,799
 

1495
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,240
 if you only go for 25 minutes it gives

1496
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:44,240
 

1497
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:46,159
 you an opportunity to stop

1498
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,159
 

1499
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,440
 and adjust if you've worked on the wrong

1500
00:25:46,149 --> 00:25:49,440
 

1501
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,640
 thing flip the slide if you would greg

1502
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:50,640
 

1503
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,960
 here's where i want to get to with this

1504
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:52,960
 

1505
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:56,240
 with getting focused

1506
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:56,240
 

1507
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:58,080
 what matters is that you leap pick one

1508
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:58,080
 

1509
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,080
 doesn't matter if you pick the wrong one

1510
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:00,080
 

1511
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:03,520
 pick one

1512
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:03,520
 

1513
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:05,600
 give it some time do a bit of the work

1514
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:05,600
 

1515
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,600
 see if you can achieve the minimum

1516
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,600
 

1517
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,799
 viable outcome the most effective

1518
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,799
 

1519
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,400
 increment now by the way when i'm

1520
00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:10,400
 

1521
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,960
 talking about this it should make sense

1522
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:10,960
 

1523
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,960
 that i

1524
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:12,960
 

1525
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,840
 not necessarily talking about building

1526
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:15,840
 

1527
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,960
 an app building a website

1528
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:16,960
 

1529
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,600
 this could be anything that you're

1530
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,600
 

1531
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,120
 working on you could be working on

1532
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:21,120
 

1533
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,440
 changing your body composition maybe you

1534
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:23,440
 

1535
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,200
 want to work out build some muscle

1536
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:25,200
 

1537
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,880
 we can do that with agility too can we

1538
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,880
 

1539
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,840
 not

1540
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:29,840
 

1541
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,960
 it may be learning a new skill it may be

1542
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:30,960
 

1543
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,400
 building your audience

1544
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,400
 

1545
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,919
 it may be social media work that you're

1546
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,919
 

1547
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,279
 doing it may be a human resources

1548
00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:35,279
 

1549
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,039
 initiative that you're doing

1550
00:26:35,269 --> 00:26:37,039
 

1551
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:39,679
 what can you deliver in the next 25

1552
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:39,679
 

1553
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:42,080
 minutes that is valuable

1554
00:26:39,669 --> 00:26:42,080
 

1555
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,720
 if we limit the exposure to 25 minutes

1556
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:42,720
 

1557
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,200
 or an hour

1558
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:45,200
 

1559
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,960
 it's so much easier to just go because

1560
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:46,960
 

1561
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,480
 the cost of failure the cost of the

1562
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,480
 

1563
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,120
 wrong choice

1564
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:51,120
 

1565
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,080
 is minimized we're not trying to

1566
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,080
 

1567
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,919
 overcome immovable

1568
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,919
 

1569
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,760
 objects with irresistible force we're

1570
00:26:53,909 --> 00:26:55,760
 

1571
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,279
 trained to wait for certainty

1572
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,279
 

1573
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,200
 and safety before we move isn't that

1574
00:26:57,269 --> 00:26:59,200
 

1575
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,320
 true do you remember school

1576
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,320
 

1577
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,320
 remember this from school where it'd be

1578
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:02,320
 

1579
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,159
 like teacher is this the right thing am

1580
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:04,159
 

1581
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,640
 i supposed to write about this

1582
00:27:04,149 --> 00:27:06,640
 

1583
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:08,000
 that's how we're trained but that's not

1584
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,000
 

1585
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,919
 agile

1586
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:09,919
 

1587
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,279
 so if we're using our training the thing

1588
00:27:09,909 --> 00:27:13,279
 

1589
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:16,159
 that we've committed to muscle memory

1590
00:27:13,269 --> 00:27:16,159
 

1591
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:18,080
 to wait for approval for readiness for

1592
00:27:16,149 --> 00:27:18,080
 

1593
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,960
 thumbs up

1594
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,960
 

1595
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,640
 it's difficult to leap it's difficult to

1596
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,640
 

1597
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,960
 be bold it's difficult to be

1598
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:24,960
 

1599
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,799
 first and a lot of what agile promises

1600
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,799
 

1601
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,679
 is that it can bring us the ability to

1602
00:27:26,789 --> 00:27:29,679
 

1603
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:32,399
 be first to the marketplace to respond

1604
00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:32,399
 

1605
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:34,480
 to changing consumer demand if we're

1606
00:27:32,389 --> 00:27:34,480
 

1607
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:36,080
 willing to leave if we're willing to go

1608
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:36,080
 

1609
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,080
 the first fundamental we must rehearse

1610
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:38,080
 

1611
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,039
 is our ability to go in the absence of a

1612
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,039
 

1613
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,000
 bulletproof

1614
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:42,000
 

1615
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,399
 plan our best buffer against failure is

1616
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:42,399
 

1617
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,279
 not

1618
00:27:42,389 --> 00:27:45,279
 

1619
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:46,240
 more study or certainty it's to fail

1620
00:27:45,269 --> 00:27:46,240
 

1621
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:50,399
 early

1622
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:50,399
 

1623
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,919
 learn fast and adjust quickly

1624
00:27:50,389 --> 00:27:51,919
 

1625
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:53,279
 you're not judged in the magnificence of

1626
00:27:51,909 --> 00:27:53,279
 

1627
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,960
 your ideas or the accuracy of your

1628
00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:54,960
 

1629
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:57,360
 predictions guys you're judged

1630
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:57,360
 

1631
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,640
 on your fearlessness and your ability to

1632
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,640
 

1633
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,960
 go think about that

1634
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,960
 

1635
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,080
 think about the people that you idolize

1636
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:02,080
 

1637
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,799

1641
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,039
 true

1642
00:28:07,669 --> 00:28:07,669

 waiting for all of this study they

1652
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,039
 

1653
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,799
 simply took an idea and they started

1654
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,799
 

1655
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:23,279

1717
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,200
 said

1718
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,200
 

1719
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,360
 i don't need to outrun the bear i just

1725
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,559
 longest or she who lasts longest wins

1726
00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:30,559
 

1727
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,760
 if you can persist in uncertainty just

00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,919
 

1787
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,080
 about a time when you were gritty

1788

 learning to love failure is how we apply

1796
00:30:38,789 --> 00:30:40,480
 

1797
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,480
 grit to agility

1798
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:42,480

1801
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,120
 often in our culture you think about

1802
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:45,120
 

1803
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,440
 failure

1804
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:47,440
 

1805
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:50,480
 in school that meant you were below the

1806
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:50,480
 

1807
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,720
 50 mark you probably had to do it again

1808
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:52,720
 

1809
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,840
 the word failure we've come to associate

1810
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:53,840
 

1811
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,240
 with not being

1812
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:56,240
 

1813
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,159
 worthy and isn't that one of the

1814
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:58,159
 

1815
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,720
 sicknesses of our modern age is the fear

1816
00:30:58,149 --> 00:30:58,720
 

1817
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,600
 of not

1818
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:01,600
 

1819
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:03,039
 being enough it's no wonder we don't

1820
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,039
 

1821
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,320
 like the word failure

1822
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:04,320
 

1823
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:06,080
 i want you to learn to love the word

1824
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:06,080
 

1825
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,120
 failure because failure is associated

1826
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,120
 

1827
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,279
 right now

1828
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:09,279
 

1829
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,360
 with shame because we assume that the

1830
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:11,360
 

1831
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:14,159
 consequences of failure are both

1832
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:14,159
 

1833
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,919
 negative and permanent but they're not

1834
00:31:14,149 --> 00:31:15,919
 

1835
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:17,840
 failure's your teacher

1836
00:31:15,909 --> 00:31:17,840
 

1837
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:19,679
 the way to find the best path is not to

1838
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,679
 

1839
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,880
 sit and study postulate

1840
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:22,880
 

1841
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:26,640
 theorize think pray sweat

1842
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:26,640
 

1843
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:29,039
 it's to do fail observe change

1844
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:29,039
 

1845
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,799
 do it again and the best way that you

1846
00:31:29,029 --> 00:31:30,799
 

1847
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:32,799
 can minimize the cost of failure is to

1848
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:32,799
 

1849
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:34,320
 make your steps small remember we talked

1850
00:31:32,789 --> 00:31:34,320
 

1851
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:36,559
 about breaking big things a thousand

1852
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,559
 

1853
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:39,039
 push-ups into ten

1854
00:31:36,549 --> 00:31:39,039
 

1855
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:41,760
 if all you waste is a couple of minutes

1856
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:41,760
 

1857
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:41,760
 a day or two

1858
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:42,070
 

1859
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,720
 there's almost no downside guess why we

1860
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:46,720
 

1861
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,399
 have daily standups guys

1862
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,399
 

1863
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,399
 what'd you do yesterday i did this how

1864
00:31:48,389 --> 00:31:50,399
 

1865
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,799
 did it go blocker got a problem didn't

1866
00:31:50,389 --> 00:31:50,799
 

1867
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,720
 work

1868
00:31:50,789 --> 00:31:52,720
 

1869
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:54,799
 okay let me help you with that by only

1870
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,799
 

1871
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:58,159
 going one day before we report

1872
00:31:54,789 --> 00:31:58,159
 

1873
00:31:54,799 --> 00:32:00,559
 failure we minimize the negative

1874
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:00,559
 

1875
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,960
 consequences of failure now what happens

1876
00:32:00,549 --> 00:32:02,960
 

1877
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:04,880
 if you have a stand-up once a week

1878
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,880
 

1879
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,240
 people ask us all the time am i allowed

1880
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:06,240
 

1881
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,039
 to have stand-ups just three times a

1882
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:07,039
 

1883
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,360
 week

1884
00:32:07,029 --> 00:32:09,360
 

1885
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:11,120
 or can i have them twice a day is there

1886
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:11,120
 

1887
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,120
 a right answer or a wrong answer you see

1888
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:13,120
 

1889
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,320
 one of the reasons why agile and scrum

1890
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,320
 

1891
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,159
 struggle so much

1892
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:16,159
 

1893
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,919
 is we're looking for rules and scripts

1894
00:32:16,149 --> 00:32:17,919
 

1895
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:20,480
 that we can run

1896
00:32:17,909 --> 00:32:20,480
 

1897
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:23,360
 there is no right one size fits all

1898
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:23,360
 

1899
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,039
 ruler script just like greg said

1900
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,039
 

1901
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,200
 the truth of the matter is whatever

1902
00:32:25,029 --> 00:32:27,200
 

1903
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:29,360
 works for you works for you

1904
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:29,360
 

1905
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,919
 but i can tell you this the more

1906
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:31,919
 

1907
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:33,840
 frequently you run a stand up

1908
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:33,840
 

1909
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,720
 the quicker you can get to problems

1910
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:36,720
 

1911
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:40,799
 repair things and shift direction

1912
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:40,799
 

1913
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:43,840
 before that time becomes sunk and wasted

1914
00:32:40,789 --> 00:32:43,840
 

1915
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:44,880
 something to think about learning to

1916
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:44,880
 

1917
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,720
 love the process of

1918
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:46,720
 

1919
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,640
 hypothesizing trying failing

1920
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:48,640
 

1921
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,320
 spectacularly and learning from that

1922
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,320
 

1923
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,760
 failure to build something that works

1924
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,760
 

1925
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,120
 even just a little bit better than the

1926
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,120
 

1927
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,480
 last time i mean this is one thing i

1928
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,480
 

1929
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,760
 learned from navy seals is that they'll

1930
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:55,760
 

1931
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,679
 sit around and say well that wasn't

1932
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,679
 

1933
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,279
 supposed to happen now what do we do

1934
00:32:57,669 --> 00:32:59,279
 

1935
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,720
 a whole bunch of people will storm that

1936
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:00,720
 

1937
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,559
 problem sit there

1938
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,559
 

1939
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,399
 call on their experiences call in their

1940
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:04,399
 

1941
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:05,840
 training call on their wit

1942
00:33:04,389 --> 00:33:05,840
 

1943
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,760
 call on their intellect calling their

1944
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,760
 

1945
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,880
 focus to propose three things that might

1946
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:08,880
 

1947
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,399
 work

1948
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:10,399
 

1949
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,679
 then we collectively look at each other

1950
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:11,679
 

1951
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,200
 and say which one do you want to try

1952
00:33:11,669 --> 00:33:13,200
 

1953
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,640
 first

1954
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,640
 

1955
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,399
 the team will go with their gut they'll

1956
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:16,399
 

1957
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,159
 all agree and then they'll roll with the

1958
00:33:16,389 --> 00:33:18,159
 

1959
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:19,279
 solution and if it doesn't work we stop

1960
00:33:18,149 --> 00:33:19,279
 

1961
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:22,399
 we cut it

1962
00:33:19,269 --> 00:33:22,399
 

1963
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:23,200
 back up and try something else to my

1964
00:33:22,389 --> 00:33:23,200
 

1965
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:25,440
 mind that's

1966
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:25,440
 

1967
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,960
 fearless now what could that change in

1968
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:26,960
 

1969
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,960
 your organization

1970
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:28,960
 

1971
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,480
 some of you mentioned uh we sort of

1972
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:30,480
 

1973
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,559
 commit but we're kind of

1974
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:32,559
 

1975
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,279
 rolling back to waterfall all the time

1976
00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:35,279
 

1977
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:36,960
 what if we committed all the way 100

1978
00:33:35,269 --> 00:33:36,960
 

1979
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:39,519
 and said when things go wrong rather

1980
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:39,519
 

1981
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,919
 than roll back to what feels safe

1982
00:33:39,509 --> 00:33:41,919
 

1983
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:44,000
 we come up with a new strategy for

1984
00:33:41,909 --> 00:33:44,000
 

1985
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,919
 solving problems

1986
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,919
 

1987
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,760
 we ask people what three experiments do

1988
00:33:45,909 --> 00:33:47,760
 

1989
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,720
 you want to try that you think might

1990
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:48,720
 

1991
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,519
 solve that problem

1992
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:51,519
 

1993
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,399
 if we did that instead we can generate

1994
00:33:51,509 --> 00:33:52,399
 

1995
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:54,159
 results

1996
00:33:52,389 --> 00:33:54,159
 

1997
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:56,559
 instead of generating fear that sends us

1998
00:33:54,149 --> 00:33:56,559
 

1999
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:59,760
 running back to waterfall

2000
00:33:56,549 --> 00:33:59,760
 

2001
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:59,760
 flip the page if you would

2002
00:34:05,029 --> 00:34:05,029
 

2003
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:08,560
 so how do you become more gritty well i

2004
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,560
 

2005
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,159
 heard some of you say you like the

2006
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:10,159
 

2007
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,760
 saying find a way or make a way and

2008
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:11,760
 

2009
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,159
 that's easy to say

2010
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:14,159
 

2011
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,200
 difficult to do i mentioned that all the

2012
00:34:14,149 --> 00:34:15,200
 

2013
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,800
 books will tell you if you want to get

2014
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,800
 

2015
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,839
 gritty do more gritty things how do you

2016
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:17,839
 

2017
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,079
 do that

2018
00:34:17,829 --> 00:34:20,079
 

2019
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:21,839
 go to the challenge navy seals have a

2020
00:34:20,069 --> 00:34:21,839
 

2021
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:24,879
 saying so do firefighters

2022
00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:24,879
 

2023
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:27,200
 that they run towards the fight

2024
00:34:24,869 --> 00:34:27,200
 

2025
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:28,159
 think about the people who went into

2026
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,159
 

2027
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,079
 those buildings

2028
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,079
 

2029
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,359
 on september 11th there were certain

2030
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:31,359
 

2031
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,919
 people

2032
00:34:31,349 --> 00:34:33,919
 

2033
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:35,520
 firefighters i'm talking about who have

2034
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:35,520
 

2035
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:37,760
 it in them

2036
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:37,760
 

2037
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:40,240
 that even though the consequences may be

2038
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:40,240
 

2039
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,560
 dire they were prepared

2040
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:42,560
 

2041
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:46,399
 to run towards that building

2042
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:46,399
 

2043
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:48,960
 understanding the risks of survival

2044
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:48,960
 

2045
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:50,240
 or the risk of non-survival rather is

2046
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:50,240
 

2047
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,720
 very high

2048
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:52,720
 

2049
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,159
 that's built into you and it's built

2050
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,159
 

2051
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,839
 into you through practice

2052
00:34:54,149 --> 00:34:55,839
 

2053
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,079
 you can practice that kind of thing too

2054
00:34:55,829 --> 00:34:58,079
 

2055
00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:00,160
 not running into burning buildings but

2056
00:34:58,069 --> 00:35:00,160
 

2057
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:01,119
 what about this have difficult

2058
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:01,119
 

2059
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,640
 conversations

2060
00:35:01,109 --> 00:35:02,640
 

2061
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,640
 turn off the hot water halfway through

2062
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,640
 

2063
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,440
 your shower take the stairs instead of

2064
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,440
 

2065
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,599
 the elevator

2066
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:07,599
 

2067
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,760
 shut your gps off and see if you can run

2068
00:35:07,589 --> 00:35:09,760
 

2069
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:13,839
 on zen navigation for a while

2070
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:13,839
 

2071
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:15,119
 compete try to break your personal best

2072
00:35:13,829 --> 00:35:15,119
 

2073
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:18,320
 look you're not going to get better by

2074
00:35:15,109 --> 00:35:18,320
 

2075
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:20,240
 going easy on yourself that's true

2076
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:20,240
 

2077
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,920
 that's true you have to surround

2078
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,920
 

2079
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,599
 yourself with people and challenges

2080
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:23,599
 

2081
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,440
 that make you bigger that make you

2082
00:35:23,589 --> 00:35:25,440

 better

2084
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,960
 

2085
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,800

2087
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,240
 some challenges that you could impose on

2088
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:30,240
 

2089
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,720

00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,320
 things that maybe you're putting off

2092
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,320
 

2093
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:39,520
 things where you feel like

2094
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:39,520

2097
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:43,520
 things where you feel like you know what

2098
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,520
 

2099
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,119

 it to somebody else where you know deep

2104
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,320
 

2105
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,960
 down in your soul

2107
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,160
 that you shouldn't have share those with

2108
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,160
 

2109
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,800
 the tribe if you would what are some

2111
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:57,359
 things where you could be more gritty

2112
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:57,359
 

2113
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,280
 if you can dig them up and you can force

2114
00:35:57,349 --> 00:35:59,280
 

2115
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:00,320
 yourself to stay with them just a little

2116
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:00,320
 

2117
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,480
 bit longer go

2119
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,839
 just a little bit further be you can

2120
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:03,839
 

2121
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,560

2126
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:10,320
 

2127
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,160
 this isn't for me but for today

2128
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:12,160
 

2129
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:15,280
 for today if you were to just say let me

2130
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:15,280
 

2131
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,280
 try that one more time

2132
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:15,430
 

2133
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:21,119
 what would happen how would that affect

2134
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:21,119
 

2135
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,119
 your teams

2136
00:36:21,829 --> 00:36:21,829
 

2137
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:25,599
 what would be possible in the team room

2138
00:36:23,589 --> 00:36:25,599
 

2139
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:28,400
 that wasn't possible yesterday

2140
00:36:25,589 --> 00:36:28,400
 

2141
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,400
 flip if you would

2142
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:31,430
 

2143
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,839
 the last aspect of the badass agile way

2144
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:35,839
 

2145
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,599
 is to get humble and get flexible that

2146
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:37,599
 

2147
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:39,280
 can mean a bunch of things it can mean

2148
00:36:37,589 --> 00:36:39,280
 

2149
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,040
 doing retrospectives continuously

2150
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:41,040
 

2151
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,320
 inspecting and adapting

2152
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,320
 

2153
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,160
 it could also mean some things that we

2154
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:44,160
 

2155
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,960
 don't traditionally associate

2156
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:46,960
 

2157
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:49,280
 with tech with work which is being more

2158
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:49,280
 

2159
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:52,240
 mindful and aware

2160
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:52,240
 

2161
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:54,480
 being more intentional with our physical

2162
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:54,480
 

2163
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,760
 presence our emotional presence

2164
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:55,760
 

2165
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,040
 it could mean things like constantly

2166
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,040
 

2167
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,880
 looking for ways to get better to

2168
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:58,880

2171
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:04,560
 it could mean being mindful of your gaps

2172
00:37:01,109 --> 00:37:04,560
 

2173
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,560
 and having a plan to fill them

2174
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:04,790
 

2175
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,880
 it could mean being able to evaluate

2176
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,880
 

2177
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,160
 your actions in terms of the value that

2178
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:10,160
 

2179
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,200
 you offer today

2180
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:13,200
 

2181
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,560
 it could be being willing to take the

2182
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,560
 

2183
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,839
 whole thing down and starting over

2184
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,839
 

2185
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,280
 that's what we do in the forge you get

2186
00:37:15,829 --> 00:37:17,280
 

2187
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:18,800
 to meet yourself for the first time in

2188
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:18,800
 

2189
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,839
 the forge you find out what you're made

2190
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:19,839
 

2191
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,599
 of

2192
00:37:19,829 --> 00:37:21,599
 

2193
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:23,280
 we take down all those assumptions and

2194
00:37:21,589 --> 00:37:23,280
 

2195
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,400
 everything you've learned to date and we

2196
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:24,400
 

2197
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,200
 rebuild you

2198
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:27,200
 

2199
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,240
 in a way with a new set of assumptions

2200
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,240
 

2201
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:31,760
 and beliefs which

2202
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:31,760
 

2203
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:34,960
 have no limit

2204
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,960
 

2205
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,599
 and finally recognizing that mastery is

2206
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:35,599
 

2207
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,599
 a journey

2208
00:37:35,589 --> 00:37:37,599
 

2209
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:39,520
 all of these things are about humility

2210
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:39,520
 

2211
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:42,160
 and being flexible

2212
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:42,160
 

2213
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:44,079
 not being insistent that this way is the

2214
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:44,079
 

2215
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,000
 way does that sound familiar guys

2216
00:37:44,069 --> 00:37:46,000
 

2217
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,520

2219
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,040
 if there's a whole lot of this is the

2220
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:49,040
 

2221
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,000
 way and it's this way because it's the

2222
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,000
 

2223
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,280
 way we've always done

2224
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:51,280
 

2225
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,359
 things and there is no other way does

2226
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,359
 

2227
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,839
 that happen to you if so

2228
00:37:53,349 --> 00:37:55,839

2233
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,320
 the most important thing i'd love for

2234
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:02,320
 

2235
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,560
 you to practice

2236
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:04,560
 

2237
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,760
 miriam says yes all the time our way or

2238
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:05,760
 

2239
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,119
 the highway amanda

2240
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,119
 

2241
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,800

2242
00:38:07,109 --> 00:38:08,800

 privately got to make sure i don't work

2244
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:10,560
 

2245
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,640
 there i'm just kidding

2246
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:12,640
 

2247
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,000
 uh but that's true everywhere right

2248
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,000
 

2249
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:17,520
 that's people in groups

2250
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:17,520
 

2251
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,320
 and pearl says the national anthem

2252
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:20,320
 

2253
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:22,320
 all right in daily practice what is get

2254
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:22,320
 

2255
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,320
 humble and get flexible really about

2256
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:24,320
 

2257
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,480
 well i'm going to pick inspect and adapt

2258
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:26,480
 

2259
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:29,119
 of all of those ones i just went through

2260
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,119
 

2261
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:31,280
 i think we understand retrospectives but

2262
00:38:29,109 --> 00:38:31,280
 

2263
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:34,160
 let me ask you a question

2264
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:34,160
 

2265
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:36,000
 could you be bold enough to retrospect

2266
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:36,000
 

2267
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,760
 every day

2268
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:37,760
 

2269
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,280
 whether you succeed or fail in anything

2270
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,280
 

2271
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,880
 you do even

2272
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:40,880
 

2273
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,960
 typing your comments into the comments

2274
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:42,960
 

2275
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,720
 window here there's a tiny act of

2276
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:44,720
 

2277
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,720
 courage involved

2278
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:46,720
 

2279
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,240
 whether you succeed whether you fail

2280
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,240
 

2281
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,000
 whether you got the outcome you wanted

2282
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:50,000
 

2283
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,240
 or whether you didn't

2284
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:52,240
 

2285
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,359
 you can't stop you got to grow you got

2286
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,359
 

2287
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,359
 to learn

2288
00:38:53,349 --> 00:38:55,359
 

2289
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:57,200
 so what questions will you ask yourself

2290
00:38:55,349 --> 00:38:57,200
 

2291
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:58,800
 to help you improve

2292
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,800
 

2293

 what single improvement or investment

2294
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:00,400
 

2295
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,520
 can you make that will help you get

2296
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:01,520
 

2297
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,560
 better at solving

2298
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:04,560
 

2299
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:06,240
 this particular problem amanda says i do

2300
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,240
 

2301
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,880
 a personal retro every day first thing

2302
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:06,880
 

2303
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:10,000
 in the morning

2304
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:10,000

2307
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,480
 by saying what did i learn

2308
00:39:11,829 --> 00:39:14,480
 

2309
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:16,320
 and what do i want to do better and the

2310
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:16,320
 

2311
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,000
 funny thing is when you do it every day

2312
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:18,000
 

2313
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,440
 it starts to pile up in your notebook

2314
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:19,440
 

2315
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,480
 there's kind of a lot going on there but

2316
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:20,480
 

2317
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,760
 you know something

2318
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:21,760
 

2319
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,079
 there's a saying that the important

2320
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:24,079
 

2321
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,520
 stuff sticks

2322
00:39:24,069 --> 00:39:25,520
 

2323
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,119
 what i mean by that is if there's

2324
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:27,119
 

2325
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:30,560
 something that you're writing over

2326
00:39:27,109 --> 00:39:30,560
 

2327
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:33,359
 every day every day five times a week

2328
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:33,359
 

2329
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:35,760
 for months on end

2330
00:39:33,349 --> 00:39:35,760
 

2331
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:37,359
 you're gonna notice it's the universe

2332
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,359

2398
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:53,760
 

2399
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:56,400
 they're sharing it

2400
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:56,400
 

2401
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,359
 um and in some way it's going to help

2402
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:57,359
 

2403
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,560
 you

2404
00:40:57,349 --> 00:41:00,560
 

2405
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:01,920
 then the whole thing about the uh making

2406
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:01,920
 

2407
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,960
 me better

2408
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:04,960
 

2409
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:08,160
 is it just changes that mindset of

2410
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:08,160
 

2411
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:11,119
 negative feedback coming in and

2412
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:11,119
 

2413
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:13,520
 you know it's it just it switches the

2414
00:41:11,109 --> 00:41:13,520
 

2415
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:13,520
 switch

2416
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:13,750
 

2417
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:21,839
 um that's what we got about it

2418
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:21,839
 

2419
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,839
 so i mean an example um

2420
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:22,470
 

2421
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,640
 you're having a difficult conversation

2422
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:26,640
 

2423
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,839
 and somebody

2424
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:29,839
 

2425
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:33,599
 says something that

2426
00:41:29,829 --> 00:41:33,599
 

2427
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:36,960
 you weren't ready for um and

2428
00:41:33,589 --> 00:41:36,960
 

2429
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:38,319
 if your first thought is thanks for

2430
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:38,319
 

2431
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,319
 making me better

2432
00:41:38,309 --> 00:41:40,319
 

2433
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:41,760
 then you'll probably receive that way

2434
00:41:40,309 --> 00:41:41,760
 

2435
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:45,359
 better then

2436
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:45,359
 

2437
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:47,200
 you end up going into reaction mode

2438
00:41:45,349 --> 00:41:47,200
 

2439
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:48,880
 okay chris do you want to just um close

2440
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,880
 

2441
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:52,880
 off on that a bit

2442
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:52,880
 

2443
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:54,800
 absolutely we are trained to be hurt by

2444
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:54,800
 

2445
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,520
 feedback

2446
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:57,520
 

2447
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:59,200
 why we attach meaning to everything that

2448
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:59,200
 

2449
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:02,560
 comes into our little

2450
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:02,560
 

2451
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,520
 monkey brains don't we so someone comes

2452
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:03,520
 

2453
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,359
 along and says

2454
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:05,359
 

2455
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,520
 nice hat and walks away we're like

2456
00:42:05,349 --> 00:42:07,520
 

2457
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:09,359
 thanks wait a second

2458
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:09,359
 

2459
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,560
 like nice hat nice hat or nice hat like

2460
00:42:09,349 --> 00:42:10,560
 

2461
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:13,599
 nice hat like we

2462
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:13,599
 

2463
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:14,319
 automatically go into that mode of what

2464
00:42:13,589 --> 00:42:14,319
 

2465
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:17,920
 did they just

2466
00:42:14,309 --> 00:42:17,920
 

2467
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:19,599
 what were they trying to say about me

2468
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,599
 

2469
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,280
 and that's what thanks for making me

2470
00:42:19,589 --> 00:42:21,280
 

2471
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:22,240
 better does for you it gets you

2472
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:22,240
 

2473
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,880
 comfortable through

2474
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:24,880
 

2475
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:26,160
 practice of understanding that feedback

2476
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:26,160
 

2477
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:29,119
 is a gift

2478
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:29,119
 

2479
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:30,480
 feedback is not a it's not an arrow that

2480
00:42:29,109 --> 00:42:30,480
 

2481
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,000
 people are throwing at you it's not a

2482
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:32,000
 

2483
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,480
 barb it's not a jab

2484
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:34,480
 

2485
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,839
 feedback is the only way you get better

2486
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:35,839
 

2487
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,599
 if you can accept that

2488
00:42:35,829 --> 00:42:37,599
 

2489
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:39,119
 in the seal teams they have a saying

2490
00:42:37,589 --> 00:42:39,119
 

2491
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:42,960
 called fight for the last

2492
00:42:39,109 --> 00:42:42,960
 

2493
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:44,720
 scrap of blame we want the bad news

2494
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:44,720
 

2495
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,960
 because the sooner we take it in the

2496
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:46,960
 

2497
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:50,480
 sooner we address it the sooner we get

2498
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:50,480
 

2499
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:52,720
 exponentially better right

2500
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:52,720
 

2501
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,400
 so i want you to try and build that

2502
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:54,400
 

2503
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,240
 within your teams if there's one thing

2504
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:56,240
 

2505
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,920
 that you could do

2506
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:57,920
 

2507
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,200
 you can't ask your teams hey guys get

2508
00:42:57,910 --> 00:42:59,200
 

2509
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,160
 more comfortable with feedback that

2510
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:00,160
 

2511
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,720
 won't work

2512
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:02,720
 

2513
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,760
 however if when people bring you

2514
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:03,760
 

2515
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,599
 feedback

2516
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,599
 

2517
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,880
 every time without fail the first thing

2518
00:43:05,589 --> 00:43:06,880
 

2519
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,079
 you do is say

2520
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:08,079
 

2521
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,560
 thanks for that thanks for making me

2522
00:43:08,069 --> 00:43:10,560
 

2523
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:12,160
 better they'll be like sir what

2524
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:12,160
 

2525
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,520
 you're like yeah thanks for making me

2526
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:13,520
 

2527
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,119
 better i understand where that's coming

2528
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:15,119
 

2529
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,240
 from you're not bringing it from a place

2530
00:43:15,109 --> 00:43:16,240
 

2531
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,760
 of criticism

2532
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:17,760
 

2533
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:20,079
 you're not bringing it from a place of

2534
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:20,079
 

2535
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:22,800
 anger or fear you're bringing it from a

2536
00:43:20,069 --> 00:43:22,800
 

2537
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:25,520
 place of this would help me if you got

2538
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:25,520
 

2539
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,400
 better at this that would help me do my

2540
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:26,400
 

2541
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,800
 job better

2542
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:28,800
 

2543
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,440
 that would help me perform more fully if

2544
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:29,440
 

2545
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,839
 you do it

2546
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:31,839
 

2547
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,880
 other people will start to crave it and

2548
00:43:31,829 --> 00:43:32,880
 

2549
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:36,000
 they'll copy it

2550
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:36,000
 

2551
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,599
 that one tiny tiny tiny tiny thing

2552
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:37,599
 

2553
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,280
 if you can do that it can make a huge

2554
00:43:37,589 --> 00:43:39,280
 

2555
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:43,599
 shift in your organization

2556
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:43,599
 

2557
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:45,680
 so let's recap for a sec

2558
00:43:43,589 --> 00:43:45,680
 

2559
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:47,599
 everything i've just taught you i've

2560
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:47,599
 

2561
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:49,200
 learned from places outside of agile but

2562
00:43:47,589 --> 00:43:49,200
 

2563
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:50,880
 if you think about it

2564
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:50,880
 

2565
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,720
 this is the most agile stuff that there

2566
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:52,720
 

2567
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,599
 is number one be intentional don't just

2568
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:53,599
 

2569
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:56,560
 do stuff

2570
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:56,560
 

2571
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:57,839
 do meaningful important stuff do things

2572
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:57,839
 

2573
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:00,000
 that move you closer

2574
00:43:57,829 --> 00:44:00,000
 

2575
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:01,680
 towards your ultimate picture better

2576
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:01,680
 

2577
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,520
 still if they're rooted

2578
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:05,520
 

2579
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:07,680
 in service to others number two

2580
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:07,680
 

2581
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:09,040
 when it comes to focusing and doing

2582
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:09,040
 

2583
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:11,920
 disciplined

2584
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:11,920
 

2585
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:13,680
 work learn how to leap learn how to get

2586
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:13,680
 

2587
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,280
 comfortable with jumping and saying i

2588
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:15,280
 

2589
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,720
 have no map i have no clue

2590
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:16,720
 

2591
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,200
 i'ma go anyway i'm going to build the

2592
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:19,200
 

2593
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,960
 map what happens next i don't know

2594
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:20,960

 you're willing

2626
00:44:51,829 --> 00:44:54,720
 

2627
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:56,240
 to sit through and when you learn how to

2628
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:56,240
 

2629
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,119

2630
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:57,119
 

2631
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,560
 your shower

2639
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,920

2640
00:45:05,349 --> 00:45:05,920
 

2641
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:08,560
 through

 people do when you see them

2646
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:12,560

 challenging situations so that you

2666
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:29,359

2669
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:33,280
 have a serious competitive leg up then

2670
00:45:32,069 --> 00:45:33,280
 

2671
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:36,640
 you turn and teach that

2672
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:36,640

 great what can we do to work around that

2680
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:43,760
 

2681
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,960
 today so that they are fast enough

2682
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:44,960
 

2683
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,560
 coach we didn't get enough time for

2684
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,560

 together

2690
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:51,200
 

2691
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,960
 that way we socialize while we work if

2692
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:52,960
 

2693
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,079
 you take those negatives and flip them

2694
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:54,079
 

2695
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,920
 into positives

2696
00:45:54,069 --> 00:45:55,920
 

2697
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:57,760
 that's great that's resilience that's

00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,560
 positive mental attitude

2700
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:00,560
 

2701
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:02,319
 and that can really change the tone in

2702
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:02,319
 

2703
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:04,400
 the room

2704
00:46:02,309 --> 00:46:04,400
 

2705
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:05,920
 and finally when it comes to getting

2706
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:05,920
 

2707
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,000
 humble and getting flexible

2708
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:08,000
 

2709
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,680
 learn to love the feedback guys the

2710
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:09,680
 

2711
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,520
 simplest thing you can try and implement

2712
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:11,520
 

2713
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,800

 really effective because what's the

2716
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:13,760
 

2717
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,920
 number one complaint

2718
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:15,920
 

2719
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:16,960
 about retrospectives we don't talk about

2720
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:16,960
 

2721
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:20,560
 the stuff

2722
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:20,560
 

2723
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:22,000
 that matters am i right

2724
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:22,000
 

2725
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,599
 put your hand up and tell me if that's

2726
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:23,599
 

2727
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,040
 true for you we go in and we talk about

2728
00:46:23,589 --> 00:46:25,040
 

2729
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:26,240
 the cookies and the snacks and the dish

2730
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:26,240
 

2731
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,040
 and that in the air conditioning and

2732
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:27,040
 

2733
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,040
 blah blah blah

2734
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:29,040
 

2735
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:30,800
 but we don't really say that guy over

2736
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:30,800
 

2737
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:32,720
 there is not getting his stuff done on

2738
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:32,720
 

2739
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,480
 time and if that's an issue and we don't

2740
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:34,480
 

2741
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:37,520
 talk about it

2742
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:37,520
 

2743
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:39,200
 what's going to change nothing so if we

2744
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:39,200
 

2745
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,760
 can learn to say thank you for making me

2746
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:39,760
 

2747
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,119
 better

2748
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:41,119
 

2749
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:43,280
 that welcomes the difficult

2750
00:46:41,109 --> 00:46:43,280
 

2751
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:47,040
 conversations it welcomes

2752
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:47,040
 

2753
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:49,520
 the generous feedback not the harmful

2754
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:49,520
 

2755
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:51,599
 you're too slow kind of nasty feedback

2756
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:51,599
 

2757
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:53,280
 the real feedback that matters so do

2758
00:46:51,589 --> 00:46:53,280
 

2759
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:55,280
 those four things

2760
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:55,280
 

2761
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,400
 and you'll realize that those are agile

2762
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:56,400
 

2763
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,640
 things

2764
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:58,640
 

2765
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,720
 and they're more important agile things

2766
00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:00,720
 

2767
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:02,160
 then is the scrum master and the agile

2768
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:02,160
 

2769
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,839
 coach the same person is the scrum

2770
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:03,839

00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,599
 master really a project manager does the

2772
00:47:03,829 --> 00:47:05,599

2775
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:09,040
 those kinds of questions are not the

2776
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:09,040
 

2777
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,920
 important questions the important

2778
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:09,920
 

2779
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,119
 questions are the ones that we're

2780
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,119

00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:23,520
 

2793
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:26,480
 the first thing that i would say is

2794
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:26,480
 

2795
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:28,800
 rather than focus on a scaling framework

2796
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:28,800
 

2797
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:30,319
 if you want people to align to what

2798
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:30,319
 

2799
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,000
 you're doing if you want people to take

2800
00:47:30,309 --> 00:47:32,000
 

2801
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:34,800
 up the faith to believe

2802
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:34,800
 

2803
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,319
 in the cause and to do what's necessary

2804
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:36,319
 

2805
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:39,680
 to make agile work

2806
00:47:36,309 --> 00:47:39,680
 

2807
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:42,800
 start small fires go hit home runs

2808
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:42,800
 

2809
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:44,079
 nobody argues with home runs if you go

2810
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:44,079
 

2811
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,079
 and watch your favorite athlete and

2812
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:46,079
 

2813
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:47,520
 they've got kind of weird form

2814
00:47:46,069 --> 00:47:47,520
 

2815
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:48,960
 like oh my goodness you know there's

2816
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:48,960
 

2817
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,280
 some pitchers for example who throw the

2818
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:49,280
 

2819
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,760
 ball

2820
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:51,760
 

2821
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:53,599
 underhanded and you look at me like

2822
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:53,599
 

2823
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:55,599
 that's not good form

2824
00:47:53,589 --> 00:47:55,599
 

2825
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:56,960
 listen if they get strikeouts they get

2826
00:47:55,589 --> 00:47:56,960
 

2827
00:47:55,599 --> 00:48:00,400
 strikeouts

2828
00:47:56,950 --> 00:48:00,400
 

2829
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:02,000
 period full stop so when you create

2830
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:02,000
 

2831
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:04,559
 successes

2832
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:04,559
 

2833
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,720
 people notice when you have something

2834
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:06,720
 

2835
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:08,800
 that nobody else has

2836
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:08,800
 

2837
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,960
 that tends to entice people to watch

2838
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:10,960
 

2839
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:14,319
 more closely to ask questions to get

2840
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:14,319
 

2841
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:16,400
 curious and to subscribe

2842
00:48:14,309 --> 00:48:16,400
 

2843
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:17,839
 to enroll to engage the best way to

2844
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:17,839
 

2845
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,520
 start a fire that other people can't

2846
00:48:17,829 --> 00:48:19,520
 

2847
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:20,000
 help but notice the best way to hit home

2848
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:20,000
 

2849
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:23,200
 runs

2850
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:23,200
 

2851
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:26,240
 start with a small outcome a small

2852
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:26,240
 

2853
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,960
 meaningful outcome my advice willing

2854
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:26,960
 

2855
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:30,400
 minds

2856
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:30,400
 

2857
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:32,720
 and projects that fit if you are able

2858
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:32,720
 

2859
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,000
 if you influence this decision bring

2860
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:34,000
 

2861
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:36,800
 together people who are already

2862
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:36,800
 

2863
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,079
 sold on agile to do the first thing and

2864
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:38,079
 

2865
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,640
 work on a project

2866
00:48:38,069 --> 00:48:40,640
 

2867
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:42,400
 that is a good fit for agility that's

2868
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:42,400
 

2869
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:44,960
 your best chance for success

2870
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:44,960
 

2871
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:46,240
 but whatever you do if you don't have

2872
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:46,240
 

2873
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:48,640
 that luxury

2874
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:48,640
 

2875
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:50,319
 that's still okay what is the smallest

2876
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:50,319
 

2877
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,200
 increment of value that you can release

2878
00:48:50,309 --> 00:48:51,200
 

2879
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:54,480
 or execute

2880
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:54,480
 

2881
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:56,000
 small small small small where you're

2882
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:56,000
 

2883
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,079
 comfortable that you can hit a home run

2884
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:58,079
 

2885
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,760
 in a short period of time if you execute

2886
00:48:58,069 --> 00:48:59,760
 

2887
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:02,000
 well

2888
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:02,000
 

2889
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,800
 and if you can do that consistently over

2890
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:02,800
 

2891
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,240
 time

2892
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:04,240
 

2893
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,160
 people will notice and if they don't

2894
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:06,160
 

2895
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:08,720
 notice advertise

2896
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:08,720
 

2897
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:09,680
 have a show and tell day bring it to the

2898
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:09,680
 

2899
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,040
 crew show them

2900
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:11,040
 

2901
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:13,200
 this is what we've been working on in

2902
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:13,200
 

2903
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,640
 team room d check out the things that we

2904
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:14,640
 

2905
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,559
 have already conquered

2906
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:16,559
 

2907
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,319
 used to be you couldn't do this now you

2908
00:49:16,549 --> 00:49:18,319
 

2909
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:18,880
 can used to be customers couldn't do

2910
00:49:18,309 --> 00:49:18,880
 

2911
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:20,880
 that

2912
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:20,880
 

2913
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,640
 now they can customers used to complain

2914
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:22,640
 

2915
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,079
 about this they don't complain about

2916
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:24,079
 

2917
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:27,200
 this anymore

2918
00:49:24,069 --> 00:49:27,200
 

2919
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:28,800
 those kinds of home runs matter those

2920
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:28,800
 

2921
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:31,839
 things attract attention

2922
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:31,839
 

2923
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,839
 greg over to you

2924
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:39,910
 

2925
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:45,839
 okay so

2926
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:51,430
 

2927
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:59,200
 so um scaling organically

2928
00:49:55,589 --> 00:49:59,200
 

2929
00:49:55,599 --> 00:50:00,000
 so i guess this is some experience that

2930
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:00,000
 

2931
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:03,040
 i've had

2932
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:03,040
 

2933
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,839
 um real recently is that i'm working

2934
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:03,839
 

2935
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:07,359
 with

2936
00:50:03,829 --> 00:50:07,359
 

2937
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:10,400
 teams that are not software teams um

2938
00:50:07,349 --> 00:50:10,400
 

2939
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:11,119
 i work with data science i'm working

2940
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:11,119
 

2941
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:14,559
 with

2942
00:50:11,109 --> 00:50:14,559
 

2943
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:17,040
 call center teams i'm working with

2944
00:50:14,549 --> 00:50:17,040
 

2945
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:18,240
 service support teams all those types of

2946
00:50:17,030 --> 00:50:18,240
 

2947
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:21,440
 teams

2948
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:21,440
 

2949
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:23,599
 and you know one thing that works for

2950
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:23,599
 

2951
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,119
 that team doesn't necessarily work for

2952
00:50:23,589 --> 00:50:25,119
 

2953
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:28,319
 the other team

2954
00:50:25,109 --> 00:50:28,319
 

2955
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:33,040
 so it's about

2956
00:50:28,309 --> 00:50:33,040
 

2957
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:36,000
 taking what you know trying it

2958
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:36,000
 

2959
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:39,040
 and trying to replicate it but if it

2960
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:39,040
 

2961
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,839
 doesn't work don't force it

2962
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:41,839
 

2963
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:45,680
 see what breaks in environments and see

2964
00:50:41,829 --> 00:50:45,680
 

2965
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:45,680
 inspect and adapt make changes

2966
00:50:47,109 --> 00:50:47,109
 

2967
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:52,319
 so that's essentially that one and the

2968
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:52,319
 

2969
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:55,599
 next one is about leadership

2970
00:50:52,309 --> 00:50:55,599
 

2971
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:57,359
 and it's about uh as a leader you need

2972
00:50:55,589 --> 00:50:57,359
 

2973
00:50:55,599 --> 00:51:00,559
 to get out of the way

2974
00:50:57,349 --> 00:51:00,559
 

2975
00:50:57,359 --> 00:51:03,680
 you need to give control to people not

2976
00:51:00,549 --> 00:51:03,680
 

2977
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:07,520
 take control and you know expect

2978
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:07,520
 

2979
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:10,559
 them to report to you let them

2980
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:10,559
 

2981
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:13,920
 find their way let them

2982
00:51:10,549 --> 00:51:13,920
 

2983
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:17,280
 so with um giving control though

2984
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:17,280
 

2985
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:19,599
 so you empower people but there is

2986
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:19,599
 

2987
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:21,359
 there is also an expected there needs to

2988
00:51:19,589 --> 00:51:21,359
 

2989
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:22,559
 be an expectation of accountability as

2990
00:51:21,349 --> 00:51:22,559
 

2991
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:26,400
 well

2992
00:51:22,549 --> 00:51:26,400
 

2993
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:28,800
 so it's it's twofold it's not just

2994
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:28,800
 

2995
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:30,720
 empower people it's also there needs to

2996
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:30,720
 

2997
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:34,079
 be accountability

2998
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:34,079
 

2999
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:36,640
 the other thing is make sure as a leader

3000
00:51:34,069 --> 00:51:36,640
 

3001
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:38,240
 you're helping people understand you

3002
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:38,240
 

3003
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:41,200
 know small changes

3004
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:41,200
 

3005
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:42,960
 we talked about that one in the um hit

3006
00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:42,960
 

3007
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:46,480
 home runs

3008
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:46,480
 

3009
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,839
 um the other one is learning we've

3010
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:47,839
 

3011
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:50,800
 talked about it as well

3012
00:51:47,829 --> 00:51:50,800
 

3013
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:52,400
 so learning is is not failure learning

3014
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:52,400
 

3015
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:55,920
 is

3016
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:55,920
 

3017
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:57,200
 is learning as you go um and in scrum

3018
00:51:55,910 --> 00:51:57,200
 

3019
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,240
 it's called empirical learning and

3020
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:58,240
 

3021
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,920
 there's a reason why it's called

3022
00:51:58,230 --> 00:51:59,920
 

3023
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:02,240
 empirical learning it's because

3024
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:02,240
 

3025
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:04,480
 we don't know how things are going to go

3026
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:04,480
 

3027
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:06,640
 so we learn as we go

3028
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:06,640
 

3029
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:09,040
 and you know inspecting adapting is all

3030
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:09,040
 

3031
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:12,480
 part of that there is no failure

3032
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:12,480
 

3033
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:16,000
 and then there's um we need

3034
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:16,000
 

3035
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:17,599
 as leaders we need to advance people

3036
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:17,599
 

3037
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,240
 and the way that we can do that is help

3038
00:52:17,589 --> 00:52:20,240
 

3039
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:22,800
 them do the things they need to do

3040
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:22,800
 

3041
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:24,720
 to do the work don't get in the way

3042
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:24,720
 

3043
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:27,760
 actually help them do what they know

3044
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:27,760
 

3045
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:30,160
 if you know encourage them to um

3046
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:30,160
 

3047
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,599
 asking for help is a good thing so we

3048
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:31,599
 

3049
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:34,160
 need to also help people

3050
00:52:31,589 --> 00:52:34,160
 

3051
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:35,920
 understand they can ask for help it's um

3052
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:35,920
 

3053
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:39,760
 in my country new zealand

3054
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:39,760
 

3055
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:42,400
 um asking for help is is not really a

3056
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:42,400
 

3057
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:44,400
 cultural thing um i'm not sure what

3058
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:44,400
 

3059
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,079
 other people think

3060
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:46,079
 

3061
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:48,880
 okay chris is there anything you want to

3062
00:52:46,069 --> 00:52:48,880
 

3063
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:50,720
 wrap up on this

3064
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:50,720
 

3065
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,079
 oh great great job thank you i want to

3066
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:52,079
 

3067
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:53,680
 leave some time for ques

3068
00:52:52,069 --> 00:52:53,680
 

3069
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:55,680
 and shut up but i think in summary

3070
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:55,680
 

3071
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:57,520
 here's what i want to get across guys

3072
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:57,520
 

3073
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,720
 if you're struggling to make agile stick

3074
00:52:57,510 --> 00:52:58,720
 

3075
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:00,400
 and make it work

3076
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:00,400
 

3077
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:02,640
 oftentimes it's because we're trying to

3078
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:02,640
 

3079
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,520
 be too specific about what's in the

3080
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:03,520
 

3081
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:05,520
 guide

3082
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:05,520
 

3083
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:07,119
 and trying to make people conform to

3084
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:07,119
 

3085
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:08,000
 those things but people don't want to

3086
00:53:07,109 --> 00:53:08,000
 

3087
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:12,160
 conform

3088
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:12,160
 

3089
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:15,359
 to your things if you simply relax a bit

3090
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:15,359
 

3091
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:16,720
 and look at for example i don't know if

3092
00:53:15,349 --> 00:53:16,720
 

3093
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:18,400
 you've noticed this but most of our

3094
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:18,400
 

3095
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:21,359
 great inventions as people

3096
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:21,359
 

3097
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:24,000
 have an analog in nature the best most

3098
00:53:21,349 --> 00:53:24,000
 

3099
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:25,440
 elegant durable bridges in the world

3100
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:25,440
 

3101
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,880
 look a little bit like the human

3102
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:28,880
 

3103
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:32,160
 skeleton in their structure the subway

3104
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:32,160
 

3105
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:34,240
 has got its um design roots in the way

3106
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:34,240
 

3107
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:36,400
 ants build tunnels underground

3108
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:36,400
 

3109
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:37,599
 most of what we do as human beings the

3110
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:37,599
 

3111
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,839
 science and the

3112
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:39,839
 

3113
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:42,480
 innovation and the things that we have

3114
00:53:39,829 --> 00:53:42,480
 

3115
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:46,079
 created and inspired

3116
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:46,079
 

3117
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:49,359
 are inspired by the things that we know

3118
00:53:46,069 --> 00:53:49,359
 

3119
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:51,599
 those things tend to be really simple

3120
00:53:49,349 --> 00:53:51,599
 

3121
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:53,680
 easily repeatable universal they don't

3122
00:53:51,589 --> 00:53:53,680
 

3123
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:55,920
 change over time

3124
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:55,920
 

3125
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:57,520
 and they're highly impactful so i say to

3126
00:53:55,910 --> 00:53:57,520
 

3127
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:00,000
 you again if you start with these four

3128
00:53:57,510 --> 00:54:00,000
 

3129
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:03,040
 things these four dimensions and you say

3130
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:03,040
 

3131
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,720
 let's be intentional let us

3132
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:04,720
 

3133
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,400
 remain focused but most importantly

3134
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:06,400
 

3135
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:08,720
 let's go let's leap

3136
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:08,720
 

3137
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:10,800
 in the absence of perfect information

3138
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:10,800
 

3139
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:12,000
 let's be greedy by leaning into the hard

3140
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:12,000
 

3141
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,880
 challenging things

3142
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:14,880
 

3143
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,480
 and let's be grateful for feedback let's

3144
00:54:14,870 --> 00:54:16,480
 

3145
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,760
 say thank you for making me better every

3146
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:17,760
 

3147
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,000
 time we do it

3148
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:20,000
 

3149
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:22,000
 those four things alone four things can

3150
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:22,000
 

3151
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,920
 make a huge change in your organization

3152
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:23,920
 

3153
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:27,040
 i hope this has helped you and inspired

3154
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:27,040
 

3155
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:27,040
 you to explore

3156
00:54:27,589 --> 00:54:27,589
 

3157
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:32,240
 the idea of be careful when you try to

3158
00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:32,240
 

3159
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:35,839
 get too fancy

3160
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:35,839
 

3161
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:36,079
 a focus on fundamentals can really help

3162
00:54:35,829 --> 00:54:36,079
 

3163
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:37,520
 you

3164
00:54:36,069 --> 00:54:37,520
 

3165
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:39,760
 think about your athletes think about

3166
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:39,760
 

3167
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:41,599
 your innovators and watch what they do

3168
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:41,599
 

3169
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:44,319
 the things they practice to perfection

3170
00:54:41,589 --> 00:54:44,319
 

3171
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:45,440
 are the things that make their game

3172
00:54:44,309 --> 00:54:45,440
 

3173
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:46,960
