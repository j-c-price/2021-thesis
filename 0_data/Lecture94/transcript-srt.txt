1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,770
 so this tutorial is mostly about

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,770
 

3
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:08,160
 negative dependent so let me just define

4
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:08,160
 

5
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:10,110
 what I mean by negative dependence what

6
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,110
 

7
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,179
 we'll have is so we'll only talk about

8
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,179
 

9
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,490
 discrete measures we'll have a discrete

10
00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:14,490
 

11
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:16,890
 probability measures so that means we

12
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,890
 

13
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:20,220
 have n random variables binary random

14
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,220
 

15
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:23,640
 variables X I or equivalently we have n

16
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,640
 

17
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,560
 items and we are seeing random subsets

18
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,560
 

19
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,279
 of these items so the X I variable so

20
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,279
 

21
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:32,369
 just the indicator variables so if item

22
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:32,369
 

23
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,860
 I is present then X is one so these are

24
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:34,860
 

25
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,989
 our binary variables now what is

26
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:36,989
 

27
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:40,079
 negative dependence so as a simple

28
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:40,079
 

29
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:41,850
 example think that this random subset

30
00:00:40,069 --> 00:00:41,850
 

31
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,610
 that you're seeing is maybe the subset

32
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,610
 

33
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:47,160
 of items that a customer buys on a given

34
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,160
 

35
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,809
 day online so now there's different

36
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,809
 

37
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,250
 items that they could choose from in

38
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,250
 

39
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:54,390
 different items where they will actually

40
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,390
 

41
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:55,920
 click yes now the which item step is

42
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,920
 

43
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,719
 actually not a completely independent

44
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:57,719
 

45
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,910
 for example if you know that they are

46
00:00:57,709 --> 00:00:59,910
 

47
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,260
 buying a cell phone it's very unlikely

48
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,260
 

49
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,860
 that they're going to buy another cell

50
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,860
 

51
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,689
 phone on the same day so basically the

52
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:06,689
 

53
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,600
 probability of seeing two both cell

54
00:01:06,679 --> 00:01:09,600
 

55
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:11,460
 phones jointly is smaller than if they

56
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,460
 

57
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,140
 were independent so this is essentially

58
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,140
 

59
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,450
 what this inequality so it says here

60
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,450
 

61
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:18,210
 that P of seeing both items together is

62
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,210
 

63
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:21,390
 smaller than P of seeing one item times

64
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,390
 

65
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:23,729
 P of seeing the other item and by

66
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,729
 

67
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,439
 dividing by the probability of that blue

68
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:25,439
 

69
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:28,530
 phone we can easily see that this really

70
00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:28,530
 

71
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,360
 says that given that I know that I'm

72
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,360
 

73
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,280
 seeing the blue phone it's much less

74
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,280
 

75
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:38,159
 likely that I'm seeing the other phone

76
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:38,159
 

77
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:40,079
 as well so that is a fairly intuitive

78
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:40,079
 

79
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,909
 concept this is negative dependent

80
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:41,909
 

81
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,799
 negative correlation where does it show

82
00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:43,799
 

83
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:45,420
 up in machine learning let me just give

84
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:45,420
 

85
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,159
 you an intuition and Soviet relator

86
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,159
 

87
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,840
 talked about in more detail about

88
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:48,840
 

89
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,360
 several different applications in

90
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,360
 

91
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,430
 machine learning the first one we

92
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,430
 

93
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,110
 already see basically anytime we have

94
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,110
 

95
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,329
 something like a budget or so where we

96
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,329
 

97
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,759
 know that a person would only pick a

98
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:59,759
 

99
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:01,170
 limited number out of some choice that

100
00:01:59,749 --> 00:02:01,170
 

101
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,700
 already gives us some kind of negative

102
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,700
 

103
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,030
 dependents because you cannot choose

104
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:06,030
 

105
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,829
 everything at the same time more broadly

106
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,829
 

107
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,649
 speaking anytime we have some prior

108
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:09,649
 

109
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:11,120
 knowledge that there's going to be

110
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,120
 

111
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:15,200
 diversity

112
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:15,200
 

113
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,300
 in our subsets that we are choosing so

114
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,300
 

115
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,280
 this could happen for example if we want

116
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,280
 

117
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,470
 to do a recommender systems and we don't

118
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,470
 

119
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,760
 want to recommend the same or redundant

120
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,760
 

121
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:25,010
 items to people you want to actually

122
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,010
 

123
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:28,519
 sort of cover a lot of different items

124
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,519
 

125
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:30,709
 that we recommend another example is

126
00:02:28,509 --> 00:02:30,709
 

127
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:33,230
 firing of neurons where we know we have

128
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:33,230
 

129
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:34,700
 a refractory period and the neuron fires

130
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,700
 

131
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,069
 and then they can't fire for some time

132
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,069
 

133
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,780
 until they fire again so there's like a

134
00:02:37,059 --> 00:02:38,780
 

135
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:41,690
 distance between them so there's

136
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,690
 

137
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:43,730
 diversity being with the firings other

138
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,730
 

139
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:46,069
 examples are in computer vision if you

140
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,069
 

141
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:48,290
 know that objects are not located in the

142
00:02:46,059 --> 00:02:48,290
 

143
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:52,160
 same place so they have to be spaced

144
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,160
 

145
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:53,750
 apart this diversity notion also are

146
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,750
 

147
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,459
 prior and diversity that you're

148
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,459
 

149
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:57,860
 implementing in probabilistic modeling

150
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:57,860
 

151
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:59,840
 it can also help interpret ability of

152
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,840
 

153
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:01,430
 your models so you could think of that

154
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,430
 

155
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,099
 your want your want to model your data

156
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,099
 

157
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:06,440
 by our clusters or latent features and

158
00:03:04,089 --> 00:03:06,440
 

159
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:08,060
 if you enforce that your latent features

160
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,060
 

161
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,190
 or classes are actually really different

162
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,190
 

163
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,920
 from each other they are diverse but you

164
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,920
 

165
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:15,140
 can end up with is actually first more

166
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,140
 

167
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,730
 complex compact representations and the

168
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,730
 

169
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,950
 second thing is that they may be also

170
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,950
 

171
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:21,640
 more interpretable and more capture

172
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,640
 

173
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:26,299
 actually latent groups in your variables

174
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:26,299
 

175
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:27,829
 and your data but there's more to

176
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,829
 

177
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:29,959
 negative dependence where it shows up

178
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:29,959
 

179
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:32,329
 not only in probabilistic modeling but

180
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:32,329
 

181
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:34,400
 also in randomized algorithms so if you

182
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,400
 

183
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:36,380
 think about having a large amount of

184
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,380
 

185
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,600
 data or you have very large models and

186
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,600
 

187
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:40,370
 you want to compress them somehow one

188
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,370
 

189
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,709
 way to do this compression is to select

190
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,709
 

191
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:45,049
 a subset of items from this data our

192
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:45,049
 

193
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:47,150
 model and use that to represent the full

194
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:47,150
 

195
00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:49,040
 set and of course at this point you want

196
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,040
 

197
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,630
 these to be non redundant you want them

198
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,630
 

199
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,750
 to somehow capture all the information

200
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,750
 

201
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:56,030
 that you have hence you want diversity

202
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:56,030
 

203
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:58,190
 or repulsion between these items and one

204
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,190
 

205
00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:00,230
 example is in matrix factorization if

206
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,230
 

207
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:02,120
 you have a big a matrix and you want to

208
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,120
 

209
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:03,769
 approximate it by selecting a few

210
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,769
 

211
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,019
 columns of that matrix you want these

212
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,019
 

213
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:09,109
 columns to really spend the column space

214
00:04:06,009 --> 00:04:09,109
 

215
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:11,329
 of the matrix another application is if

216
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:11,329
 

217
00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:12,739
 you want to compress deep models and

218
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,739
 

219
00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:15,519
 want to compress them by actually

220
00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:15,519
 

221
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:15,519
 pruning neurons

222
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:17,090
 

223
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:22,360
 the third area big area where negative

224
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,360
 

225
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:24,630
 dependence shows up is when you try to

226
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,630
 

227
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,470
 do exploration active learning

228
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,470
 

229
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:28,180
 experimental design essentially

230
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,180
 

231
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:30,430
 everywhere you try to select some

232
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,430
 

233
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:33,160
 queries experiments that you wanna run

234
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:33,160
 

235
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:35,650
 or labels that you want to obtain before

236
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,650
 

237
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,090
 you observe them you want to get as much

238
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,090
 

239
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,729
 information as possible you were

240
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,729
 

241
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:41,560
 necessarily somehow spread them out you

242
00:04:39,719 --> 00:04:41,560
 

243
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:43,509
 will somehow want them to capture as

244
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,509
 

245
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,600
 different information as possible that's

246
00:04:43,499 --> 00:04:46,600
 

247
00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:48,580
 useful for you to not have redundancy so

248
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,580
 

249
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,800
 negative dependence has also shown up in

250
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,800
 

251
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,900
 many works and where you try to type a

252
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,900
 

253
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,910
 parameter optimization where you try to

254
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,910
 

255
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:59,650
 do experimental design where you try to

256
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:59,650
 

257
00:04:54,910 --> 00:05:01,389
 do Bayesian optimization and so on so we

258
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,389
 

259
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:03,160
 see there's actually a good number of

260
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:03,160
 

261
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:04,870
 reasons to look at the property of

262
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,870
 

263
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:09,389
 negative dependence because it occurs in

264
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,389
 

265
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:11,910
 many places in machine learning - so

266
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:11,910
 

267
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:14,680
 what is up with negative dependence

268
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,680
 

269
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:16,720
 here's the mout line of the tutorial for

270
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,720
 

271
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,460
 the next two hours what we'll actually

272
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,460
 

273
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,780
 look at with respect to negative

274
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,780
 

275
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,909
 dependence so we start with the

276
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,909
 

277
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:24,340
 introduction and we already saw a few

278
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:24,340
 

279
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:26,800
 examples I want to show you one concrete

280
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,800
 

281
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:28,150
 example that's maybe the best-known in

282
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,150
 

283
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,280
 the machine learning community and these

284
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,280
 

285
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:32,949
 are determinants appoint processes and

286
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,949
 

287
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,659
 then you talk about not only negative

288
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:34,659
 

289
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:36,130
 dependence but stronger notions of

290
00:05:34,649 --> 00:05:36,130
 

291
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:37,510
 negative dependence and why they

292
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,510
 

293
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:40,270
 actually could matter and what nice

294
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,270
 

295
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:42,550
 implications they may have and at that

296
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,550
 

297
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:44,770
 point we will also look at relations

298
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,770
 

299
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:46,780
 between discrete probability and

300
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,780
 

301
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:49,630
 negative dependence and the geometry of

302
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:49,630
 

303
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:52,270
 polynomials as a powerful tool to reason

304
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,270
 

305
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:54,729
 with such distributions and as a

306
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,729
 

307
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:56,590
 specific implication I will then talk

308
00:05:54,719 --> 00:05:56,590
 

309
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:58,539
 about how you care this all of this can

310
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,539
 

311
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:01,720
 actually help you to sample from

312
00:05:58,529 --> 00:06:01,720
 

313
00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:03,070
 negatively dependent distributions after

314
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,070
 

315
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,669
 that we'll have a break and then we will

316
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,669
 

317
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:08,169
 continue with part-2 and so it will

318
00:06:05,659 --> 00:06:08,169
 

319
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:10,240
 present some further implications for

320
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,240
 

321
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:12,849
 example how can you use negative

322
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,849
 

323
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,380
 dependence to approximate partition

324
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,380
 

325
00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:19,120
 functions which is typically a very hard

326
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:19,120
 

327
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:20,349
 problem and then we'll talk a little bit

328
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,349
 

329
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,389
 about how you can actually learn a

330
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:22,389
 

331
00:06:20,349 --> 00:06:25,090
 specific example determinantal point

332
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:25,090
 

333
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:27,660
 processes and in particular many

334
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,660
 

335
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:29,700
 different applications in

336
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,700
 

337
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:33,330
 matrix approximation and experimental

338
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:33,330
 

339
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:36,500
 design and several other and then we'll

340
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,500
 

341
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:45,810
 show you some perspectives and breakup

342
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:45,810
 

343
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:47,760
 so yeah okay it's back okay so this is

344
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,760
 

345
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:49,440
 the outline let's start with the first

346
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,440
 

347
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,660
 example and let's look at one concrete

348
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,660
 

349
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,600
 distribution determinantal point

350
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,600
 

351
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:56,400
 processes so as I said to one negative

352
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,400
 

353
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,760
 dependence that somehow capture some

354
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:59,760
 

355
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,620
 notion of repulsion or diversity seeing

356
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,620
 

357
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,530
 one item makes it less likely to see

358
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:04,530
 

359
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:06,690
 some other items and one distribution

360
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,690
 

361
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:09,200
 that very intuitively captures diversity

362
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,200
 

363
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:11,790
 is the following think of my little

364
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,790
 

365
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:14,820
 example with the items that you can shop

366
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,820
 

367
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:17,340
 and I think every item is represented as

368
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,340
 

369
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:20,070
 a vector some feature vector and now the

370
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:20,070
 

371
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:22,140
 probability of seeing two items jointly

372
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,140
 

373
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:24,180
 is proportional to the volume that is

374
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,180
 

375
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:26,090
 spanned by their feature vectors so it's

376
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,090
 

377
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,080
 just the volume of the parallelepiped

378
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,080
 

379
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:30,750
 spanned by those vectors and it's

380
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,750
 

381
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,160
 actually proportional to the square so

382
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,160
 

383
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,690
 now if you think about it if you have

384
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,690
 

385
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,700
 items that are very different this is

386
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,700
 

387
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:38,550
 going to be very large if you had items

388
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:38,550
 

389
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,810
 that are very similar this volume is

390
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,810
 

391
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,220
 going to shrink and shrink and if it's

392
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,220
 

393
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:42,870
 actually the same vector it's going to

394
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,870
 

395
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:46,770
 be volume zero so you'll never ever

396
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:46,770
 

397
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:48,240
 sample the same item twice so this is

398
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,240
 

399
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:51,090
 essentially what this is represented

400
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:51,090
 

401
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,860
 here and this notion of the volumes you

402
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,860
 

403
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:54,600
 can generalize it to more than two

404
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,600
 

405
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,040
 dimensions it's a bit harder to draw so

406
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,040
 

407
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:59,550
 in three dimension is going to be a cube

408
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:59,550
 

409
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:01,620
 and so on so you see directly this

410
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,620
 

411
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:04,160
 distribution Diary be tries to

412
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,160
 

413
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:06,419
 essentially sample vectors that are as

414
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,419
 

415
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,830
 orthogonal to each other as possible to

416
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:07,830
 

417
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:10,290
 somehow pointing in different directions

418
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,290
 

419
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:12,270
 giving you different information you can

420
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,270
 

421
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:14,340
 scale this also by scaling the lengths

422
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,340
 

423
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:16,460
 of the vectors that is another

424
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,460
 

425
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:22,650
 possibility to introduce a bias towards

426
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:22,650
 

427
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:24,960
 certain variables okay so now the nice

428
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,960
 

429
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:26,610
 thing is that this notion of volume

430
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,610
 

431
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,460
 actually can be very comfortably and

432
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,460
 

433
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:32,070
 compactly described in closed form by

434
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:32,070
 

435
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:33,810
 determinants of matrices all that you

436
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,810
 

437
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:37,979
 really need to define is an inner

438
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,979
 

439
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:40,560
 product between all your items or some

440
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:40,560
 

441
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:41,340
 similarity matrix equivalently so what

442
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,340
 

443
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,260
 we really need

444
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,260
 

445
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:45,750
 if we have n different items we need an

446
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,750
 

447
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:48,150
 n-by-n similarity or kernel matrix where

448
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,150
 

449
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:51,180
 the I J's entry tells you what is the

450
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,180
 

451
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:52,860
 similarity between item I and J or the

452
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,860
 

453
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:55,710
 inner product between the vectors

454
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:55,710
 

455
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:58,650
 representing those items and this matrix

456
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,650
 

457
00:08:55,710 --> 00:09:01,230
 should be positive semi-definite and now

458
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,230
 

459
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:03,720
 I say that the probability of seeing

460
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,720
 

461
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:06,630
 that s is proportional to the

462
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,630
 

463
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:09,810
 determinant of a sub matrix of this big

464
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,810
 

465
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:11,280
 matrix so so to illustrate this let's

466
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,280
 

467
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:13,890
 say I want to look at the probability of

468
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,890
 

469
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:16,770
 the set 2 3 4 I just take the rows and

470
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,770
 

471
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:18,960
 columns of 2 3 4 and that gives me sub

472
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,960
 

473
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:21,420
 matrix of my matrix indicated by these

474
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,420
 

475
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:24,600
 items and I'll take the determinant of

476
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,600
 

477
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:27,210
 that that's why it's called determinant

478
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:27,210
 

479
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,190
 or point process so now we already see

480
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,190
 

481
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:30,360
 here okay we I say proportional to the

482
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,360
 

483
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:32,700
 determinant for the first challenge

484
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,700
 

485
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,530
 typically here is what is the

486
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,530
 

487
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,570
 normalization constant here what is the

488
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,570
 

489
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:38,430
 partition function and in general for

490
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,430
 

491
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:41,910
 discrete distributions this can be very

492
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,910
 

493
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:43,560
 very hard to compute luckily here this

494
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,560
 

495
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:46,380
 is actually very simple to compute and

496
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,380
 

497
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,300
 it's just in closed form and in fact

498
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:48,300
 

499
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,890
 many other things that are often hard to

500
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,890
 

501
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,990
 compute like computing marginal

502
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,990
 

503
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:53,820
 distribution conditioning all of these

504
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,820
 

505
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:55,800
 are very easy with determinant or point

506
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,800
 

507
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,180
 processes essentially they all have some

508
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,180
 

509
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,370
 determinant will formula where you do

510
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,370
 

511
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:01,680
 some simple modification to your matrix

512
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,680
 

513
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:03,510
 so this is actually very nice we get

514
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,510
 

515
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,950
 closed-form formulas and defining the

516
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,950
 

517
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:06,480
 matrix is something that we very often

518
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,480
 

519
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:08,490
 do in machine learning to in kernel

520
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,490
 

521
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,020
 learning you need exact kernel based

522
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,020
 

523
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:11,790
 learning you need exactly the same thing

524
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,790
 

525
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:16,140
 all you need is feature vectors or

526
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:16,140
 

527
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:18,300
 similarities a little bit to the history

528
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,300
 

529
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:20,010
 so determinant a point processes as far

530
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,010
 

531
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:23,760
 as I know were first introduced in a

532
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,760
 

533
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:25,320
 paper by Odile McKee in 1975 where they

534
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,320
 

535
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,960
 were called fermion processes and were

536
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,960
 

537
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:30,270
 actually modeling repulsion of particles

538
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:30,270
 

539
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,890
 the name determinantal point process

540
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,890
 

541
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:35,640
 came up a bit later in a paper by

542
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,640
 

543
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:37,770
 borodin and Orshansky and i only have

544
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,770
 

545
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,660
 time to speak a little bit about this DP

546
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,660
 

547
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:41,370
 piece here if you want to know more

548
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,370
 

549
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,620
 there's actually very nice survey by

550
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,620
 

551
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:45,720
 Alex coulis Calissa and Ben Tasker in

552
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,720
 

553
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,600
 the foundations in Trent series that

554
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,600
 

555
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,610
 gives you a nice and further

556
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,610
 

557
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,420
 introduction and also several

558
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,420
 

559
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:53,420
 applications

560
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:53,950
 

561
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:58,040
 but let's look at a few examples where

562
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,040
 

563
00:10:56,210 --> 00:11:00,010
 actually determinantal point processes

564
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,010
 

565
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,390
 show up naturally so they show up in

566
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,390
 

567
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:04,160
 mathematics a lot so for example

568
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,160
 

569
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:06,820
 eigenvalues of certain random matrices

570
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,820
 

571
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,680
 have a determinantal distribution

572
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:09,680
 

573
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:13,550
 there's also many communitarian examples

574
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:13,550
 

575
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:16,220
 let me just show you two of those the

576
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,220
 

577
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:18,350
 first one is an example of random

578
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,350
 

579
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:20,660
 spanning tree so here think about that

580
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,660
 

581
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:23,690
 the set of items that you're choosing

582
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,690
 

583
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:26,990
 from are the set of edges in a graph and

584
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,990
 

585
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:29,330
 now what what you observe is a subset of

586
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,330
 

587
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:31,610
 edges and these subsets will always form

588
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,610
 

589
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:33,440
 a spanning tree in the graph so you

590
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,440
 

591
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:35,150
 never have any cycles and it's basically

592
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,150
 

593
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,730
 the largest set of edges that doesn't

594
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,730
 

595
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:39,860
 form a cycle and now average spanning

596
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,860
 

597
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,030
 tree has the same probability so you

598
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,030
 

599
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,550
 have a uniform distribution over

600
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,550
 

601
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:46,160
 spanning trees that can be described by

602
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,160
 

603
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:47,900
 a determinant or joint process and that

604
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,900
 

605
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,600
 is a very specific one because you will

606
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:50,600
 

607
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:52,040
 always observe sets of the same size all

608
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,040
 

609
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,830
 the spanning trees have the same size

610
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:54,830
 

611
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:57,800
 exactly an M minus one if you have M

612
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,800
 

613
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:59,450
 nodes it's not generally the case in

614
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,450
 

615
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:02,690
 determining those processes that you

616
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,690
 

617
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:05,960
 always observe sets of the same size so

618
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,960
 

619
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:08,630
 this is a special model the next one is

620
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,630
 

621
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:10,340
 a sense in random sequences so here what

622
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,340
 

623
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:13,070
 I did is I just drew random digits

624
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,070
 

625
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:15,110
 between 0 & 9 and for every location

626
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,110
 

627
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:18,260
 here so I get some random sequence of

628
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,260
 

629
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:21,710
 numbers and then I mark every position

630
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,710
 

631
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:24,950
 where the sequence increases so you get

632
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,950
 

633
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:26,960
 an increase from 0 to 2 from 2 to 8 from

634
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,960
 

635
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:29,570
 0 to 9 and so on so this gives me a

636
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,570
 

637
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:31,760
 random set of locations and now I can

638
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,760
 

639
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:33,710
 look at this the set of locations that's

640
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,710
 

641
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,540
 a subset of all possible locations and

642
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,540
 

643
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:39,680
 that can also be described by a

644
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:39,680
 

645
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:41,390
 determinantal point process those are

646
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,390
 

647
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,520
 just some fun come in a toriel example

648
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,520
 

649
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:45,140
 to show you there's many more to show

650
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,140
 

651
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,850
 you sort of the breads of this kind of

652
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,850
 

653
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:51,620
 distribution we're all negative

654
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:51,620
 

655
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:53,270
 dependence shows up but you can also do

656
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,270
 

657
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,860
 is you can just see okay what do these

658
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,860
 

659
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:57,350
 samples actually look like if I just

660
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:57,350
 

661
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:59,000
 sample them in 2d so here I didn't take

662
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,000
 

663
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:01,370
 inner product I used a Gaussian kernel

664
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:01,370
 

665
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,620
 and on the left hand side you see

666
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,620
 

667
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:05,780
 samples of a determinantal point process

668
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,780
 

669
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:07,150
 on the right hand side you see the same

670
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,150
 

671
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:10,330
 number of points sample

672
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:10,330
 

673
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:13,150
 formerly at random while both of them

674
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,150
 

675
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:15,310
 somehow are very well spread out the DPP

676
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,310
 

677
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:17,140
 somehow better spread out it really

678
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,140
 

679
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:18,190
 tries to cover everything and the points

680
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,190
 

681
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:20,320
 are more repulsed there's less

682
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,320
 

683
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:22,780
 clustering happening that happens still

684
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:22,780
 

685
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,460
 with the uniform distribution so this

686
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:24,460
 

687
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:26,080
 just illustrates that really what the

688
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,080
 

689
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:28,270
 samples that you get are really really

690
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,270
 

691
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:31,240
 well spread out in some sense because of

692
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:31,240
 

693
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:33,850
 the repulsive properties and this

694
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:33,850
 

695
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,010
 already also is useful to model certain

696
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,010
 

697
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:38,170
 phenomena in nature so here's one

698
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,170
 

699
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:41,050
 example these are termite mounds in

700
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,050
 

701
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:42,760
 Brazil this is a recent paper in biology

702
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,760
 

703
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:44,670
 just to show you and they actually - all

704
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,670
 

705
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:47,530
 of these black dots here are locations

706
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,530
 

707
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:49,360
 of this mound and you see actually that

708
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,360
 

709
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:51,370
 they also very well spread out so this

710
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,370
 

711
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,050
 is just another interesting example very

712
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,050
 

713
00:13:51,370 --> 00:14:01,810
 possibly DPP's could be a very good

714
00:13:53,040 --> 00:14:01,810
 

715
00:13:53,050 --> 00:14:03,370
 model to describe natural phenomena okay

716
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,370
 

717
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:05,320
 so now we know a little bit about

718
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,320
 

719
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,820
 determinantal point processes I didn't

720
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,820
 

721
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,710
 tell you much where they actually useful

722
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,710
 

723
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:11,140
 in machine learning and you'll see many

724
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,140
 

725
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:12,700
 other examples of that later on and in

726
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,700
 

727
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:14,290
 fact many of the examples I showed you

728
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,290
 

729
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,970
 in the beginning that's actually where

730
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,970
 

731
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:20,740
 you can use a determinantal point

732
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:20,740
 

733
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:22,480
 processes or DPP's let's instead look a

734
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,480
 

735
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:24,400
 little bit more into the theory and

736
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,400
 

737
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,650
 let's look at kind of how could we

738
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26,650
 

739
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,210
 actually are more carefully define

740
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,210
 

741
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:30,910
 negative dependence and why would we

742
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,910
 

743
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:33,250
 actually want to do that and that's how

744
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,250
 

745
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:39,040
 we can we will come across the relation

746
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:39,040
 

747
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:40,390
 of distributions and polynomials so we

748
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,390
 

749
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,160
 have just a reminder slide of my

750
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,160
 

751
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:44,170
 definition of negative dependence will

752
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:44,170
 

753
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:47,380
 be of these binary variables X I or

754
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,380
 

755
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:49,470
 equivalently random set and we say that

756
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,470
 

757
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:53,200
 the joint probability is smaller than

758
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:53,200
 

759
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:56,950
 the product of if they were in the items

760
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:56,950
 

761
00:14:53,200 --> 00:15:00,730
 were independent so this notion of

762
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,730
 

763
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:02,470
 negative dependence is equivalent to the

764
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,470
 

765
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:04,660
 following inequality it's essentially a

766
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,660
 

767
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:06,040
 negative correlation inequality that the

768
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:06,040
 

769
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:07,750
 expectation of the product of the

770
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,750
 

771
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:11,680
 variables is smaller than the product of

772
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,680
 

773
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:15,610
 the expectations now this already gives

774
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:15,610
 

775
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:18,290
 you a few different useful things but

776
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,290
 

777
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:20,600
 often what people are after is

778
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,600
 

779
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:22,430
 maybe stronger things like can we

780
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,430
 

781
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,460
 actually sample from such distributions

782
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,460
 

783
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:27,710
 and this doesn't necessarily imply

784
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:27,710
 

785
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:30,230
 anything strong here or what about

786
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,230
 

787
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:32,450
 concentration results in such things and

788
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,450
 

789
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:34,760
 for this matter you could look at

790
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,760
 

791
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:37,220
 stronger versions of this kind of

792
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,220
 

793
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:39,080
 inequality how could we make this

794
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,080
 

795
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,610
 stronger there's essentially a few

796
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,610
 

797
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,710
 different things we could do one thing

798
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,710
 

799
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:44,960
 we could do is we could say we could

800
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,960
 

801
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:48,320
 actually apply our Tory functions to my

802
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:48,320
 

803
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:50,900
 X I and to my XJ in the after applying

804
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:50,900
 

805
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,930
 these functions the very the variable

806
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:53,930
 

807
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:55,280
 should still be negatively correlated so

808
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,280
 

809
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:57,350
 that's stronger than just saying they

810
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,350
 

811
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,600
 like this correlation inequality should

812
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,600
 

813
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:01,100
 hold the other thing we could do is we

814
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,100
 

815
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,900
 could say let's not just look at pairs

816
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,900
 

817
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:06,080
 let's look at larger sets of variables

818
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:06,080
 

819
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:08,600
 and they should also be negatively

820
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,600
 

821
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:12,080
 correlated everything to both of them

822
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:12,080
 

823
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:15,020
 and the way we could do both of them is

824
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:15,020
 

825
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:18,260
 that we partition our universe into two

826
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:18,260
 

827
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:20,900
 parts and now we take one set from each

828
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,900
 

829
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:23,060
 like basically look at the intersection

830
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:23,060
 

831
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:25,250
 of s with one set and the intersection

832
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:25,250
 

833
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:26,780
 of s with the other part and then apply

834
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,780
 

835
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:29,150
 some arbitrary functions so that

836
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:29,150
 

837
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:33,380
 basically replaces the X I and the XJ

838
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:33,380
 

839
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:34,910
 the two different variables and formally

840
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:34,910
 

841
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:37,610
 what this looks like is what is called

842
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,610
 

843
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:39,500
 negative association so here I take the

844
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,500
 

845
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:41,900
 same negative correlation inequality but

846
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:41,900
 

847
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:46,160
 instead of just taking X I and XJ I take

848
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:46,160
 

849
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:48,620
 a subset from I and a subset of J so X I

850
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:48,620
 

851
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:52,310
 XJ are just like single pieces your

852
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:52,310
 

853
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:54,520
 indicator variables and you get out from

854
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,520
 

855
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:58,100
 this one you get out exactly the same

856
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:58,100
 

857
00:16:54,520 --> 00:17:00,590
 inequalities at the top if you say the

858
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:00,590
 

859
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:03,290
 function G is the indicator function of

860
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,290
 

861
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:07,010
 item I so it's one as long as itemized

862
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,010
 

863
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:08,900
 and my set and H is 1 as long as item J

864
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,900
 

865
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:11,270
 is in my set so these are two specific

866
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:11,270
 

867
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,950
 functions the other thing that we need

868
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,950
 

869
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:14,780
 is that this function are both monotone

870
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,780
 

871
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:16,370
 increasing that means if my sets

872
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,370
 

873
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:19,520
 increase the functions actually also

874
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,520
 

875
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:21,320
 increase otherwise you could of course

876
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,320
 

877
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:25,040
 like if you put a negative sign these

878
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:25,040
 

879
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:27,560
 things don't hold anymore so this is the

880
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,560
 

881
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:29,390
 notion of negative association it has

882
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,390
 

883
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,400
 somewhat of a history

884
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,400
 

885
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:33,230
 it is known for example it meant for

886
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,230
 

887
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:36,620
 people who are analyzing algorithms they

888
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:36,620
 

889
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:39,290
 looked at this and its properties it

890
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:39,290
 

891
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:41,480
 seems like this a little bit unwieldy to

892
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,480
 

893
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:42,650
 be like proof something like this

894
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:42,650
 

895
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,630
 because it has the world for all

896
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,630
 

897
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:46,730
 possible increasing functions so it

898
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,730
 

899
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:48,670
 seems a bit unwieldy so let's think a

900
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,670
 

901
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:51,500
 little bit about how we could actually

902
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,500
 

903
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:54,320
 like establish that this kind of thing

904
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:54,320
 

905
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:56,150
 holds but before we do this let me show

906
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,150
 

907
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:59,270
 you a simple example of a distribution

908
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,270
 

909
00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:01,640
 where this actually holds so it's again

910
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,640
 

911
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:03,470
 a choice type of distribution so let's

912
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,470
 

913
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,090
 say we have a thirsty researcher has

914
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,090
 

915
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:07,100
 time to go to one coffee shop and

916
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,100
 

917
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:09,380
 there's a number of like a different

918
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:09,380
 

919
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:11,929
 coffee shops and we have indicator

920
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:11,929
 

921
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:15,890
 variables so bi is one if the researcher

922
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,890
 

923
00:18:11,929 --> 00:18:18,530
 goes to coffee shop one I and now the

924
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,530
 

925
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:21,860
 set of the eyes of my bi random

926
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,860
 

927
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:24,380
 variables is negatively associated this

928
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,380
 

929
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:25,760
 is not so hard to proof if you think

930
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,760
 

931
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:29,090
 about the inequality with the indicator

932
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:29,090
 

933
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:31,010
 so here only one will ever be one you

934
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,010
 

935
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:34,309
 can generalize this and say I go to one

936
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,309
 

937
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:36,549
 coffee shop and one lunch place and

938
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:36,549
 

939
00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:39,830
 maybe one dinner place we have like

940
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:39,830
 

941
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:41,870
 three different groups of choices and I

942
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,870
 

943
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:47,059
 pick one from each that also will have a

944
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:47,059
 

945
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:48,620
 negative association so how what is up

946
00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:48,620
 

947
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:50,929
 with negative association how do i

948
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,929
 

949
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:53,299
 establish it and that's a stronger

950
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:53,299
 

951
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:55,100
 notion and to think about this let's

952
00:18:53,289 --> 00:18:55,100
 

953
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:59,030
 first look at the counter part positive

954
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:59,030
 

955
00:18:55,100 --> 00:19:00,740
 association so for positive association

956
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,740
 

957
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:02,270
 I could just take my inequality and flip

958
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:02,270
 

959
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,419
 it around and say instead of negative

960
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,419
 

961
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:09,500
 correlation of positive correlations now

962
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:09,500
 

963
00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:11,630
 after applying my functions and this is

964
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,630
 

965
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:14,210
 what you will get so now we have we can

966
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,210
 

967
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:16,400
 do away with the disjoint sets because a

968
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,400
 

969
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:17,690
 function is always positively correlated

970
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,690
 

971
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,880
 with itself it's okay

972
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,880
 

973
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:22,790
 that works here too so this is positive

974
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:22,790
 

975
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:24,980
 Association positive Association also

976
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,980
 

977
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:27,860
 has been studied quite a bit and there's

978
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:27,860
 

979
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:30,500
 actually a fairly well-known theorem

980
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,500
 

981
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:32,750
 that establishes a condition that

982
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:32,750
 

983
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,940
 implies positive association and that is

984
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,940
 

985
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:37,850
 simple to check and this theorem is

986
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:37,850
 

987
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:39,620
 called the fkg theorem after its

988
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,620
 

989
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:42,510
 discoverers fortuyn castellane and

990
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:42,510
 

991
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:46,470
 Ginebra and what this condition says

992
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:46,470
 

993
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:48,450
 is that if I take the probability of any

994
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,450
 

995
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:50,820
 set s times the probability for any set

996
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,820
 

997
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:53,370
 T is smaller than probability of their

998
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:53,370
 

999
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:58,200
 union types the probability of their

1000
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,200
 

1001
00:19:53,370 --> 00:20:00,090
 intersection this is also called the fkg

1002
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,090
 

1003
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:03,420
 lattice condition or multivariate

1004
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,420
 

1005
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:04,860
 totally positive so things like in sink

1006
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,860
 

1007
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,630
 models with positive correlations

1008
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,630
 

1009
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:09,240
 satisfy this certain Gaussian

1010
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,240
 

1011
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:10,500
 distribution satisfy this several others

1012
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,500
 

1013
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,140
 and the nice thing is that this

1014
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:13,140
 

1015
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:18,060
 condition implies positive Association

1016
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:18,060
 

1017
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:19,800
 and this is very easier to check so this

1018
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,800
 

1019
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:21,840
 since this is a well-known theorem and

1020
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,840
 

1021
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,400
 this is kind of nice and has been used

1022
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,400
 

1023
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,200
 in many different places we could say

1024
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,200
 

1025
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,330
 well what about negative dependence

1026
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,330
 

1027
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,220
 could we just flip both inequalities and

1028
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,220
 

1029
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:31,110
 get like I can flip the lower inequality

1030
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:31,110
 

1031
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:34,040
 and say that always implies the upper

1032
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,040
 

1033
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:36,030
 inequality like the negative association

1034
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:36,030
 

1035
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:38,700
 unfortunately it doesn't work

1036
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,700
 

1037
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:41,250
 so negative dependence is a bit more

1038
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:41,250
 

1039
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:43,920
 brittle and a bit trickier in this

1040
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,920
 

1041
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:46,380
 respect this is just one example where

1042
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,380
 

1043
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:48,570
 it doesn't like the positive result

1044
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,570
 

1045
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:51,660
 which is kind of nice doesn't directly

1046
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,660
 

1047
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:53,880
 translate into the negative world so

1048
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,880
 

1049
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:56,100
 what happens for negative dependence is

1050
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:56,100
 

1051
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,210
 that the upper guy implies the lower guy

1052
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:57,210
 

1053
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,910
 but not vice versa

1054
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,910
 

1055
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:02,970
 so we don't always get like exact

1056
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,970
 

1057
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:04,890
 symmetry so what happened was like

1058
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,890
 

1059
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,660
 people looked at it like negative

1060
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,660
 

1061
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:09,240
 dependence is somehow a bit more tricky

1062
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:09,240
 

1063
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:11,130
 than positive dependence so maybe also

1064
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:11,130
 

1065
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,140
 negative Association per se is not the

1066
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,140
 

1067
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:14,940
 right notion of a strong notion of

1068
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:14,940
 

1069
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:18,690
 negative dependence maybe what we want

1070
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:18,690
 

1071
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:20,820
 is actually something else so in 2000

1072
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,820
 

1073
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:22,530
 Pimentel wrote a paper which was called

1074
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,530
 

1075
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:25,080
 towards the theory of negative

1076
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,080
 

1077
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:27,450
 dependence where he surveyed a lot of

1078
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:27,450
 

1079
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:29,340
 different notions of negative dependence

1080
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,340
 

1081
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:31,530
 that could were proposed or had been

1082
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,530
 

1083
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:33,210
 looked at and said like what are the

1084
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,210
 

1085
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:37,110
 relations between those two and what

1086
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,110
 

1087
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:39,630
 would actually be something that would

1088
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,630
 

1089
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:41,880
 be a good notion of negative dependence

1090
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,880
 

1091
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:45,030
 and what is good so he basically laid

1092
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:45,030
 

1093
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:47,700
 out a few different properties that this

1094
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:47,700
 

1095
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:49,530
 kind of notion should have so one is

1096
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:49,530
 

1097
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,970
 that it would imply negative association

1098
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,970
 

1099
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:54,540
 so we still want to have the negative

1100
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,540
 

1101
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:55,460
 association and the other another one

1102
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:55,460
 

1103
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,409
 that is

1104
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:57,409
 

1105
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:59,299
 the natural is that they should be

1106
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,299
 

1107
00:21:57,409 --> 00:22:01,549
 closed under operations that I do so if

1108
00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:01,549
 

1109
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:04,520
 a function has this notion of negative

1110
00:22:01,539 --> 00:22:04,520
 

1111
00:22:01,549 --> 00:22:06,770
 dependence then its marginal should also

1112
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,770
 

1113
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:09,440
 have this notion of negative dependence

1114
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,440
 

1115
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:11,299
 and if I take do conditioning I still

1116
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,299
 

1117
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,100
 want this negative dependence to hold so

1118
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:13,100
 

1119
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:15,559
 I want closeness under all these things

1120
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,559
 

1121
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:18,440
 and then there were a few other things

1122
00:22:15,549 --> 00:22:18,440
 

1123
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:20,149
 like unimodal rank sequences the rank

1124
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,149
 

1125
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,559
 sequence means that I look at the

1126
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:21,559
 

1127
00:22:20,149 --> 00:22:24,020
 probabilities of each of the

1128
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:24,020
 

1129
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:26,299
 cardinalities of my set and this gives

1130
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,299
 

1131
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:28,130
 me like I want for one size one size to

1132
00:22:26,289 --> 00:22:28,130
 

1133
00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:29,990
 size three and I look like how do they

1134
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,990
 

1135
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:32,390
 behave as a function of the size okay

1136
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,390
 

1137
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:33,770
 and this should be unimodal and in fact

1138
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,770
 

1139
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:36,020
 it should satisfy something much

1140
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,020
 

1141
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:39,399
 stronger so a stronger notion of law

1142
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:39,399
 

1143
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:43,789
 concavity and this is intimately related

1144
00:22:39,389 --> 00:22:43,789
 

1145
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:48,260
 actually to negative dependence another

1146
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:48,260
 

1147
00:22:43,789 --> 00:22:51,350
 one is a stochastic average that implies

1148
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:51,350
 

1149
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:53,450
 certain concentration of measure results

1150
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,450
 

1151
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:57,470
 and not going to go more into detail of

1152
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,470
 

1153
00:22:53,450 --> 00:23:00,200
 that so these conditions that he laid

1154
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,200
 

1155
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:03,350
 out they were say that question was

1156
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:03,350
 

1157
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:06,770
 answered in 2009 and a key to answering

1158
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,770
 

1159
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:08,450
 his many of his questions was looking at

1160
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,450
 

1161
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:11,270
 the generating polynomial of a

1162
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,270
 

1163
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:13,340
 distribution so what is the generating

1164
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,340
 

1165
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:16,970
 polynomial for any discrete distribution

1166
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:16,970
 

1167
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:18,649
 I can define a polynomial by making the

1168
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,649
 

1169
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:22,070
 probabilities the coefficients in this

1170
00:23:18,639 --> 00:23:22,070
 

1171
00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:24,679
 polynomial so now if I have n items or n

1172
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,679
 

1173
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:27,200
 random variables I get a vector of

1174
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:27,200
 

1175
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:29,690
 length n that's Z and now I define a

1176
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:29,690
 

1177
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,240
 polynomial on that Z and that polynomial

1178
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,240
 

1179
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:35,120
 I can take any possible subset of the

1180
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:35,120
 

1181
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:37,880
 coordinates the I and the coordinates

1182
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:37,880
 

1183
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:41,059
 where I take a subset s we'll get the

1184
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:41,059
 

1185
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:45,559
 coefficient mu of s so that is like mass

1186
00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:45,559
 

1187
00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:48,590
 of s probability of s so this polynomial

1188
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:48,590
 

1189
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:50,720
 I can always define and it turns out

1190
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,720
 

1191
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:53,390
 this polynomials actually key to many of

1192
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:53,390
 

1193
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,159
 those results let but let's first try to

1194
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,159
 

1195
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:57,010
 understand this polynomial a little

1196
00:23:55,149 --> 00:23:57,010
 

1197
00:23:55,159 --> 00:24:00,020
 better so to get you a simple example

1198
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,020
 

1199
00:23:57,010 --> 00:24:02,090
 let's say we have two random variables

1200
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:02,090
 

1201
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:03,980
 and we define it on two variables so

1202
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,980
 

1203
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:05,630
 here's what it looks like you just get

1204
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:05,630
 

1205
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:08,790
 four terms you can either have the empty

1206
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:08,790
 

1207
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:10,950
 set item1 item2 or both of them

1208
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,950
 

1209
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:12,540
 and here I just simplified notation by

1210
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,540
 

1211
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:14,429
 using a subscript itself actually

1212
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:14,429
 

1213
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:17,340
 writing new of empty said address new

1214
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:17,340
 

1215
00:24:14,429 --> 00:24:20,250
 subscript empty set so this is the

1216
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:20,250
 

1217
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:22,740
 generating polynomial now the

1218
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,740
 

1219
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:24,690
 interesting thing is that operations I

1220
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,690
 

1221
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:26,850
 can do on this polynomial directly

1222
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,850
 

1223
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:29,220
 translate into operations I can do and

1224
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,220
 

1225
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:31,860
 my distribution and vice versa and that

1226
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:31,860
 

1227
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:33,750
 can be very helpful and to get you just

1228
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:33,750
 

1229
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:36,480
 a little bit of an idea how this works

1230
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,480
 

1231
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:38,070
 let me show you two examples of this so

1232
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:38,070
 

1233
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,080
 the first one is we just want to obtain

1234
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,080
 

1235
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:41,880
 a coefficient of this polynomial so we

1236
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,880
 

1237
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:45,080
 want to pull out the probability of

1238
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:45,080
 

1239
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:49,470
 seeing just item one so this is mu of 1

1240
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:49,470
 

1241
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:51,390
 how could we do this so what we do is we

1242
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,390
 

1243
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:53,490
 first differentiate the polynomial with

1244
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,490
 

1245
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:56,490
 respect to Z 1 1 is the item that we

1246
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,490
 

1247
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:58,440
 want so since this polynomial actually

1248
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,440
 

1249
00:24:56,490 --> 00:25:01,400
 has no higher powers if you think about

1250
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:01,400
 

1251
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:03,720
 it every Z always occurs with power one

1252
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:03,720
 

1253
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:05,730
 all you have to do is you have to look

1254
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,730
 

1255
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,410
 at which terms have a Z 1 then delete

1256
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,410
 

1257
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:09,900
 the Z one and discard all the other

1258
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,900
 

1259
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:13,169
 terms so what you get is mu 1 plus mu 1

1260
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:13,169
 

1261
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:15,690
 2 times Z 2 and now what we wanted was

1262
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:15,690
 

1263
00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:18,120
 to pull out mu 1 so what you just do is

1264
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,120
 

1265
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:19,950
 you set Z in general to 0 so if you

1266
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,950
 

1267
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:23,070
 evaluate it at 0 and what you get

1268
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:23,070
 

1269
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:25,020
 magically is new ones so this works also

1270
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,020
 

1271
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:27,179
 if you do something that's like larger

1272
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:27,179
 

1273
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:29,730
 sets you just differentiate with all of

1274
00:25:27,169 --> 00:25:29,730
 

1275
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:32,190
 the items in that set and then you said

1276
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,190
 

1277
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:36,720
 Z to 0 and get pull you out exactly that

1278
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:36,720
 

1279
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:38,250
 coefficient so that was example one that

1280
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,250
 

1281
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,280
 always shows you ok there's like some

1282
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,280
 

1283
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:42,660
 relation between those what operations I

1284
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,660
 

1285
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:45,419
 can do and if I want to know something

1286
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:45,419
 

1287
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:47,970
 about my distribution the second one I

1288
00:25:45,409 --> 00:25:47,970
 

1289
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:49,559
 want to show you is marginalization so

1290
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,559
 

1291
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:51,929
 let's define a new distribution over

1292
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:51,929
 

1293
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:54,179
 just one item the first one that's just

1294
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,179
 

1295
00:25:51,929 --> 00:25:57,120
 the marginal of one so basically what's

1296
00:25:54,169 --> 00:25:57,120
 

1297
00:25:54,179 --> 00:26:01,320
 the probability of seeing item one in my

1298
00:25:57,110 --> 00:26:01,320
 

1299
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:04,080
 sense how do I get the correct at the

1300
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:04,080
 

1301
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:06,809
 generating polynomial for that one so

1302
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:06,809
 

1303
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,520
 what you do is you set Z two to one so

1304
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,520
 

1305
00:26:06,809 --> 00:26:10,710
 basically all the other guys you said to

1306
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,710
 

1307
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:13,530
 one all the ones corresponding two items

1308
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,530
 

1309
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:16,440
 not that one and then I just collect the

1310
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,440
 

1311
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:19,559
 terms so what is remaining is just c1 as

1312
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:19,559
 

1313
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,740
 a variable and if you look at the terms

1314
00:26:19,549 --> 00:26:20,740
 

1315
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:24,220
 that you're getting I just wrote

1316
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:24,220
 

1317
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:26,110
 I'm out here for you is that the first

1318
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:26,110
 

1319
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:29,110
 part that doesn't have a coefficient is

1320
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:29,110
 

1321
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:32,410
 the one that's new empty set plus Mewtwo

1322
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:32,410
 

1323
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:34,750
 and that's the probability of not seeing

1324
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,750
 

1325
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:36,670
 item one and the other part is the

1326
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,670
 

1327
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:37,990
 coefficient that actually remain with c1

1328
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,990
 

1329
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:42,160
 and that's the probability of seeing

1330
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:42,160
 

1331
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:45,309
 item 1 so what I got here very easily by

1332
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:45,309
 

1333
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:47,620
 just setting some stuff to one was the

1334
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:47,620
 

1335
00:26:45,309 --> 00:26:50,190
 generating polynomial for the marginal

1336
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:50,190
 

1337
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:53,140
 distribution of z1

1338
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:53,140
 

1339
00:26:50,190 --> 00:27:00,040
 that's just example 2 so this actually

1340
00:26:53,130 --> 00:27:00,040
 

1341
00:26:53,140 --> 00:27:01,960
 is fairly simple as an operation and you

1342
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,960
 

1343
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:04,360
 can imagine that if I say okay there's

1344
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:04,360
 

1345
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:06,580
 like certain operations I can do on the

1346
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,580
 

1347
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:10,210
 polynomial and I get actually operations

1348
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:10,210
 

1349
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:12,580
 that work on the distribution properties

1350
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,580
 

1351
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:14,860
 of the polynomial should also translate

1352
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:14,860
 

1353
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:18,280
 into properties of my distributions and

1354
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:18,280
 

1355
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:20,290
 vice versa and that actually what's true

1356
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,290
 

1357
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:22,179
 and the specific property that we will

1358
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,179
 

1359
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:24,460
 be after here is something that relates

1360
00:27:22,169 --> 00:27:24,460
 

1361
00:27:22,179 --> 00:27:26,140
 to the zeros of this polynomial so weird

1362
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:26,140
 

1363
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:31,450
 are actually which these make this

1364
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:31,450
 

1365
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:33,970
 polynomial 0 or don't make it 0 and in a

1366
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,970
 

1367
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:38,200
 landmark paper in 2009 bourgeois Brendan

1368
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:38,200
 

1369
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:40,300
 and we get defined the distribution this

1370
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,300
 

1371
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,790
 family of distributions called strongly

1372
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:42,790
 

1373
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:44,140
 Rayleigh measures and these are defined

1374
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,140
 

1375
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:46,300
 actually exactly why are these

1376
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:46,300
 

1377
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:48,010
 generating polynomials and what they say

1378
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,010
 

1379
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:51,220
 is that this polynomial should satisfy

1380
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,220
 

1381
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:52,900
 what is called real stability so what

1382
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:52,900
 

1383
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:54,610
 does that mean real means the

1384
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:54,610
 

1385
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:56,380
 coefficients are real numbers which we

1386
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,380
 

1387
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:58,270
 get because they are probability

1388
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:58,270
 

1389
00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:01,059
 distribution has like real values of

1390
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,059
 

1391
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:04,120
 probabilities the second and what are

1392
00:28:01,049 --> 00:28:04,120
 

1393
00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:06,100
 stable means stable means that if the

1394
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:06,100
 

1395
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:08,200
 imaginary parts of the z of all the

1396
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:08,200
 

1397
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:10,150
 sea-ice are positive this polynomial

1398
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:10,150
 

1399
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:12,340
 shouldn't vanish so none of the zeros

1400
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,340
 

1401
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:15,730
 should be in that part where all the Z

1402
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:15,730
 

1403
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:18,220
 is are positive and it turns out this

1404
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,220
 

1405
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:20,320
 class of families actually satisfies

1406
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:20,320
 

1407
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:21,940
 pretty much all the conditions laid out

1408
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,940
 

1409
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:26,530
 by P mental except for some

1410
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:26,530
 

1411
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:28,750
 conditionings so this looks a bit weird

1412
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,750
 

1413
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:31,059
 to like this condition like all the

1414
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,059
 

1415
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:33,260
 imaginary parts bigger than 1 bigger

1416
00:28:31,049 --> 00:28:33,260
 

1417
00:28:31,059 --> 00:28:34,970
 than 0 sorry to get a little bit

1418
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,970
 

1419
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:38,180
 an intuition for it if you imagine just

1420
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,180
 

1421
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:40,700
 a polynomial of one variable if I say

1422
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:40,700
 

1423
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:42,290
 that if the imaginary part is bigger

1424
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,290
 

1425
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:45,800
 than zero this shouldn't vanish

1426
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:45,800
 

1427
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:47,540
 since the roots come in pairs conjugate

1428
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,540
 

1429
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,940
 pairs it means that the polynomial only

1430
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:49,940
 

1431
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:52,250
 has real numbers as roots so it's a real

1432
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:52,250
 

1433
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:54,110
 rooted polynomial and essentially what

1434
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,110
 

1435
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:56,300
 we have here some generalization of a

1436
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,300
 

1437
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:59,330
 polynomial whose roots are only real and

1438
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:59,330
 

1439
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:01,070
 this so-called multi affine functions

1440
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,070
 

1441
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:03,890
 where you have only powers of one of the

1442
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,890
 

1443
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:05,810
 sea-ice give you such a generalization

1444
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,810
 

1445
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:10,310
 so this is a condition a generalization

1446
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:10,310
 

1447
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:11,930
 essentially of real rootedness to give

1448
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,930
 

1449
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:13,280
 you even more of an intuition if you

1450
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,280
 

1451
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:15,140
 look at what does this polynomial

1452
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:15,140
 

1453
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:17,660
 actually look like for a determinantal

1454
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:17,660
 

1455
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:19,310
 point process for example what you get

1456
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:19,310
 

1457
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:21,860
 is essentially a version of the

1458
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,860
 

1459
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:23,480
 characteristic polynomial so

1460
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:23,480
 

1461
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:25,940
 characteristic polynomial if you

1462
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,940
 

1463
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,710
 remember linear algebra you can is

1464
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,710
 

1465
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:29,450
 essentially polynomial that tells you

1466
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,450
 

1467
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:31,070
 what are the eigenvalues of that of a

1468
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,070
 

1469
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:33,950
 matrix and the matrix that we talk about

1470
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,950
 

1471
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:36,110
 here is that similarity matrix and since

1472
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,110
 

1473
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:37,870
 it's symmetric and positive-definite

1474
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,870
 

1475
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:40,460
 this matrix has real eigenvalues

1476
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,460
 

1477
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:43,160
 positive numbers so the zeros of this

1478
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:43,160
 

1479
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:50,030
 polynomial will also be real numbers

1480
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:50,030
 

1481
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:52,160
 because of that and now the other nice

1482
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,160
 

1483
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:55,910
 thing is that actually real stable

1484
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:55,910
 

1485
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:58,340
 polynomials have a very rich set of

1486
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,340
 

1487
00:29:55,910 --> 00:30:02,570
 mathematics around them that we can use

1488
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:02,570
 

1489
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:04,760
 and translate to our distributions so

1490
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,760
 

1491
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:06,830
 real stable polynomials have been

1492
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,830
 

1493
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:08,750
 studied quite a bit studying the

1494
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,750
 

1495
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:10,730
 univariate case actually goes back to at

1496
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,730
 

1497
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:13,120
 least Newton so there's the so-called

1498
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,120
 

1499
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:16,880
 Newton identities there's lots of

1500
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:16,880
 

1501
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:19,340
 interesting studies in particular there

1502
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:19,340
 

1503
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,690
 have people have identified powerful

1504
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:20,690
 

1505
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:22,340
 closeness properties of these

1506
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,340
 

1507
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:24,040
 polynomials basically what kinds of

1508
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:24,040
 

1509
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:27,500
 operations can I do on my polynomial

1510
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:27,500
 

1511
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:30,650
 that retain the real stability property

1512
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:30,650
 

1513
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:33,110
 that don't change that and I could go

1514
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,110
 

1515
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:34,790
 ahead now and take these operations as

1516
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,790
 

1517
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:36,260
 we saw operations on the polynomial

1518
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,260
 

1519
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:38,090
 translate into operations of my

1520
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,090
 

1521
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:39,560
 distribution and see what do they

1522
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,560
 

1523
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:41,630
 actually correspond to in the world of

1524
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,630
 

1525
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,970
 distributions and that's how you get the

1526
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,970
 

1527
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:45,390
 results such as clue

1528
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,390
 

1529
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:48,909
 and marginalization closeness under

1530
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:48,909
 

1531
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:50,620
 conditioning and so on so it just

1532
00:30:48,899 --> 00:30:50,620
 

1533
00:30:48,909 --> 00:30:54,460
 follows from actually looking at the

1534
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:54,460
 

1535
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:57,070
 theory of these polynomials another

1536
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:57,070
 

1537
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:59,440
 thing I just want to mention is that the

1538
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:59,440
 

1539
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:01,570
 condition that my polynomial is real

1540
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:01,570
 

1541
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,900
 stable this generating polynomial is

1542
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,900
 

1543
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:06,789
 equivalent to this condition that I

1544
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:06,789
 

1545
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,860
 wrote here and that is a condition that

1546
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:08,860
 

1547
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:11,470
 looks at derivatives so what you do is

1548
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:11,470
 

1549
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:13,480
 you take first you take any two items I

1550
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,480
 

1551
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:15,940
 and J and you first take the derivative

1552
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:15,940
 

1553
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,530
 with respect to I and then you take

1554
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:17,530
 

1555
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:21,549
 derivative of the vector J and you

1556
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:21,549
 

1557
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:22,720
 multiply this and then you do on the

1558
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:22,720
 

1559
00:31:21,549 --> 00:31:25,270
 right-hand side what you do is you just

1560
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:25,270
 

1561
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,309
 take the polynomial or you take twice do

1562
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,309
 

1563
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:30,100
 differentiate twice so product of

1564
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:30,100
 

1565
00:31:27,309 --> 00:31:34,179
 different differentials versus

1566
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:34,179
 

1567
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:35,799
 differencing twice and what you should

1568
00:31:34,169 --> 00:31:35,799
 

1569
00:31:34,179 --> 00:31:37,450
 get is if you evaluate this at any

1570
00:31:35,789 --> 00:31:37,450
 

1571
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:40,630
 vector X that the left-hand side is

1572
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,630
 

1573
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:42,610
 larger than the right-hand side so this

1574
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,610
 

1575
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:45,100
 looks a little bit counterintuitive it

1576
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,100
 

1577
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:48,309
 implies actually things like this logs

1578
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:48,309
 

1579
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:49,690
 of modularity or LOC negative lattice

1580
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:49,690
 

1581
00:31:48,309 --> 00:31:51,750
 condition that I showed you with a

1582
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,750
 

1583
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:56,140
 positive correlation positive

1584
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:56,140
 

1585
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:58,480
 correlations and in fact the way you get

1586
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:58,480
 

1587
00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:00,130
 the lower identity is by actually

1588
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:00,130
 

1589
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,250
 differentiating with respect to all

1590
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,250
 

1591
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:05,020
 items in s and all items in CNT if you

1592
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,020
 

1593
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:06,549
 remember that's how you get out actually

1594
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:06,549
 

1595
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:10,510
 the coefficients this other distribution

1596
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:10,510
 

1597
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:12,940
 like the probabilities another thing is

1598
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,940
 

1599
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:15,039
 that if you look at this condition it

1600
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:15,039
 

1601
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:16,419
 looks also pretty alien but if you

1602
00:32:15,029 --> 00:32:16,419
 

1603
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:18,070
 actually look at this condition and look

1604
00:32:16,409 --> 00:32:18,070
 

1605
00:32:16,419 --> 00:32:20,409
 at different types of negative

1606
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,409
 

1607
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:22,240
 dependence people have looked at they

1608
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,240
 

1609
00:32:20,409 --> 00:32:24,909
 actually correspond to variations of

1610
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:24,909
 

1611
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:28,720
 this condition such as this holding only

1612
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:28,720
 

1613
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:30,730
 not for all X in the wrist but maybe

1614
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:30,730
 

1615
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,530
 just on the positives or just evaluated

1616
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,530
 

1617
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:35,559
 at one and so on

1618
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,559
 

1619
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:37,179
 so actually negative dependence per se

1620
00:32:35,549 --> 00:32:37,179
 

1621
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:39,400
 just means this condition should hold

1622
00:32:37,169 --> 00:32:39,400
 

1623
00:32:37,179 --> 00:32:43,150
 evaluated just at one and nothing else

1624
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:43,150
 

1625
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:44,590
 so x equals one so this condition also

1626
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,590
 

1627
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:46,630
 shows you like how these different

1628
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,630
 

1629
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:51,640
 negative dependence properties become

1630
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:51,640
 

1631
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:54,309
 stronger and stronger so we have the

1632
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:54,309
 

1633
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,870
 power of real stable polynomials and we

1634
00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:55,870
 

1635
00:32:54,309 --> 00:32:57,760
 have this

1636
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,760
 

1637
00:32:55,870 --> 00:33:00,909
 dependence properties it implies what

1638
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:00,909
 

1639
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:02,679
 does it gain us let's look a little bit

1640
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:02,679
 

1641
00:33:00,909 --> 00:33:05,710
 of the properties of strongly Rayleigh

1642
00:33:02,669 --> 00:33:05,710
 

1643
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:07,029
 measures or SR measures the first one is

1644
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,029
 

1645
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:09,120
 that actually I get these closeness

1646
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:09,120
 

1647
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:11,909
 conditions like closeness under

1648
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:11,909
 

1649
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,840
 marginalization under conditioning and

1650
00:33:11,899 --> 00:33:13,840
 

1651
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:16,179
 several other things like take

1652
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:16,179
 

1653
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:18,669
 multiplying with a independent

1654
00:33:16,169 --> 00:33:18,669
 

1655
00:33:16,179 --> 00:33:24,250
 distribution also it keeps you in the

1656
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:24,250
 

1657
00:33:18,669 --> 00:33:25,539
 class so that is useful for many

1658
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,539
 

1659
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:28,000
 different things the other thing is that

1660
00:33:25,529 --> 00:33:28,000
 

1661
00:33:25,539 --> 00:33:29,950
 the strongly Rayleigh illness implies

1662
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:29,950
 

1663
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,809
 many different of the negative

1664
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,809
 

1665
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:33,700
 dependence conditions that were proposed

1666
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:33,700
 

1667
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:35,710
 earlier so negative association is one

1668
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:35,710
 

1669
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:39,250
 of them there are several others you get

1670
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:39,250
 

1671
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:41,020
 out so for example the this expectation

1672
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,020
 

1673
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:42,789
 of products is smaller than product of

1674
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:42,789
 

1675
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:47,799
 the expectation these kinds of

1676
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:47,799
 

1677
00:33:42,789 --> 00:33:49,870
 correlation inequalities other things

1678
00:33:47,789 --> 00:33:49,870
 

1679
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:51,279
 that are useful is concentration of

1680
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,279
 

1681
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:53,950
 measure results so if you have too

1682
00:33:51,269 --> 00:33:53,950
 

1683
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:56,080
 strong negative dependencies essentially

1684
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,080
 

1685
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:58,360
 your variables behave like as if they

1686
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:58,360
 

1687
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:01,029
 were independent and that can be very

1688
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:01,029
 

1689
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:02,559
 useful if you want to analyze dependent

1690
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:02,559
 

1691
00:34:01,029 --> 00:34:05,110
 random variables that's typically much

1692
00:34:02,549 --> 00:34:05,110
 

1693
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:07,510
 harder than independent random variables

1694
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,510
 

1695
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:09,339
 so we're just has been used a lot is in

1696
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,339
 

1697
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:11,109
 algorithm design where you do like

1698
00:34:09,329 --> 00:34:11,109
 

1699
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:13,149
 dependent rounding or something and

1700
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:13,149
 

1701
00:34:11,109 --> 00:34:15,520
 you'll certainly have dependent

1702
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:15,520
 

1703
00:34:13,149 --> 00:34:17,260
 variables and you still want to show

1704
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:17,260
 

1705
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,240
 some kind of concentration inequalities

1706
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:19,240
 

1707
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:20,740
 this is where this can be extremely

1708
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,740
 

1709
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:24,280
 useful and often you actually get

1710
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:24,280
 

1711
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:25,899
 negative dependence there so this has

1712
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,899
 

1713
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:28,030
 been established for lectures taking at

1714
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:28,030
 

1715
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:30,760
 the some or the card expected card like

1716
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,760
 

1717
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:32,679
 the cardinality of the sets omit you can

1718
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,679
 

1719
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:36,760
 do it for Lipschitz functions and matrix

1720
00:34:32,669 --> 00:34:36,760
 

1721
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:39,490
 inequalities too as I already indicated

1722
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:39,490
 

1723
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:42,639
 this gives you a rhythmic implications

1724
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,639
 

1725
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:45,369
 and one area that I'm going to talk

1726
00:34:42,629 --> 00:34:45,369
 

1727
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,929
 about next is in terms of sampling you

1728
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:46,929
 

1729
00:34:45,369 --> 00:34:50,169
 will actually get fast sampling

1730
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:50,169
 

1731
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:52,540
 algorithm salt the second one that we'll

1732
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,540
 

1733
00:34:50,169 --> 00:34:54,190
 talk about in the next part is a pool

1734
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:54,190
 

1735
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:55,929
 approximate counting appropriate

1736
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,929
 

1737
00:34:54,190 --> 00:35:01,540
 approximating partition functions by

1738
00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:01,540
 

1739
00:34:55,929 --> 00:35:03,339
 optimization and the third one is

1740
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:03,339
 

1741
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:05,510
 approximation algorithms as I already

1742
00:35:03,329 --> 00:35:05,510
 

1743
00:35:03,339 --> 00:35:08,000
 indicated for example to analyze

1744
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,000
 

1745
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:09,200
 the algorithms so there's a lot of

1746
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:09,200
 

1747
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,960
 different there's even more different

1748
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,960
 

1749
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:15,080
 things that you can do with these

1750
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:15,080
 

1751
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:17,240
 polynomials these are two important ones

1752
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:17,240
 

1753
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:21,200
 we're also there has been quite a bit of

1754
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:21,200
 

1755
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:23,030
 recent interest and work on those so we

1756
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:23,030
 

1757
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,130
 got these nice properties we get

1758
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,130
 

1759
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:26,870
 different application possible

1760
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,870
 

1761
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:29,170
 applications and there's going to be

1762
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:29,170
 

1763
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:32,180
 many more in machine learning I think

1764
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,180
 

1765
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:33,410
 let me show you one other strongly

1766
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:33,410
 

1767
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,880
 railing measure that is not a

1768
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,880
 

1769
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:36,620
 determinantal point process so

1770
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:36,620
 

1771
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,900
 determinated point process we kind of

1772
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:38,900
 

1773
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:40,640
 had waverly established by saying the

1774
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:40,640
 

1775
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:43,550
 polynomial is like the characteristic

1776
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:43,550
 

1777
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:45,350
 polynomial and eigenvalues are real so

1778
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,350
 

1779
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:48,140
 this one looks like a determinant a

1780
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:48,140
 

1781
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:50,720
 point process but is not so here we have

1782
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:50,720
 

1783
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:54,260
 a huge matrix that has lots of columns

1784
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:54,260
 

1785
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:56,060
 and more columns than rows and now the

1786
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:56,060
 

1787
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:58,160
 probability of selecting a subset of

1788
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:58,160
 

1789
00:35:56,060 --> 00:36:00,140
 columns is proportional to the outer

1790
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:00,140
 

1791
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,450
 product of this determinant of the outer

1792
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:02,450
 

1793
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:06,110
 product of these columns in a TPP you

1794
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:06,110
 

1795
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:08,150
 would take the inner product so this one

1796
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,150
 

1797
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:10,070
 is not a TPP but it satisfies the

1798
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,070
 

1799
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:11,390
 strongly Rayleigh property so the

1800
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,390
 

1801
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:13,910
 difference is also that this one

1802
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,910
 

1803
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:16,160
 actually you can sample more columns

1804
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:16,160
 

1805
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:18,050
 than if they are in dimension D more

1806
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:18,050
 

1807
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,880
 than D columns where is if you take

1808
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,880
 

1809
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:24,110
 inner products the matrix will always be

1810
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:24,110
 

1811
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:25,730
 low rank so how do you establish that

1812
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,730
 

1813
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:28,850
 this thing has to strongly really

1814
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,850
 

1815
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:30,890
 property and in fact how you can prove

1816
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,890
 

1817
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:32,780
 this is by using exactly the closeness

1818
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,780
 

1819
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:34,490
 properties of the polynomial so you look

1820
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:34,490
 

1821
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:37,610
 at the generating polynomial and you can

1822
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,610
 

1823
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:39,800
 relate it to a polynomial that is

1824
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,800
 

1825
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:41,090
 related to a determinant and so you

1826
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:41,090
 

1827
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:44,720
 could start out from a real rooted

1828
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:44,720
 

1829
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:48,560
 polynomial and you end up with 1 by

1830
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:48,560
 

1831
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:50,990
 doing these translations so actually you

1832
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:50,990
 

1833
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:55,220
 start with an SR polynomial and you end

1834
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:55,220
 

1835
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:58,010
 up with an SR polynomial so this is

1836
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:58,010
 

1837
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:59,750
 again where the power of using the

1838
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,750
 

1839
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:03,440
 polynomials comes in and actually helps

1840
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:03,440
 

1841
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:04,820
 us establishing this condition another

1842
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,820
 

1843
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,620
 thing you may actually wonder is where

1844
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:06,620
 

1845
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:07,970
 does the name strongly Rayleigh actually

1846
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:07,970
 

1847
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:10,960
 come from where does this really come

1848
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,960
 

1849
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:13,160
 from and in fact that really comes from

1850
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:13,160
 

1851
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,410
 the so called Rayleigh monotonicity

1852
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,410
 

1853
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:16,119
 property if you

1854
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,119
 

1855
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:18,579
 get electrical circuits and look at how

1856
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:18,579
 

1857
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:20,200
 conductance is behave so this

1858
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,200
 

1859
00:37:18,579 --> 00:37:22,930
 essentially related to the kickoff loss

1860
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:22,930
 

1861
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:25,539
 and this actually people looked at when

1862
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,539
 

1863
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:27,390
 they were looking at random spanning

1864
00:37:25,529 --> 00:37:27,390
 

1865
00:37:25,539 --> 00:37:30,490
 tree type distributions so this also

1866
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:30,490
 

1867
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:33,039
 says that okay our random spanning tree

1868
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,039
 

1869
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:34,960
 distribution from the beginning is a

1870
00:37:33,029 --> 00:37:34,960
 

1871
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:39,250
 strongly rarely measured that's another

1872
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:39,250
 

1873
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:40,960
 example however there's also limits so

1874
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,960
 

1875
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:43,869
 negative dependence is nice and powerful

1876
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:43,869
 

1877
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:46,750
 but there's also limitations to it for

1878
00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:46,750
 

1879
00:37:43,869 --> 00:37:49,390
 example I told you that well negative

1880
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:49,390
 

1881
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:51,940
 dependence implies notions of diversity

1882
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,940
 

1883
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:54,160
 and repulsion maybe sometimes you would

1884
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:54,160
 

1885
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:56,500
 actually have sort of a handle on how

1886
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:56,500
 

1887
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:58,690
 negatively dependent things are like how

1888
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:58,690
 

1889
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,829
 diverse things are how much do they

1890
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,829
 

1891
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:01,900
 repulse each other

1892
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,900
 

1893
00:37:59,829 --> 00:38:04,450
 one way to do this would be to say I

1894
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:04,450
 

1895
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:06,880
 take actually my probability to a power

1896
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,880
 

1897
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:08,289
 P this is almost like a temperature so

1898
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:08,289
 

1899
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,450
 if P is zero you get a uniform

1900
00:38:08,279 --> 00:38:10,450
 

1901
00:38:08,289 --> 00:38:12,309
 distribution if P is one get the

1902
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,309
 

1903
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:13,960
 original as our measure if P is bigger

1904
00:38:12,299 --> 00:38:13,960
 

1905
00:38:12,309 --> 00:38:16,630
 than one you get like even stronger

1906
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:16,630
 

1907
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:20,589
 repulsion you go so you get a graded

1908
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:20,589
 

1909
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:22,119
 version is this still and strongly

1910
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:22,119
 

1911
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:25,359
 really measure if I take arbitrary

1912
00:38:22,109 --> 00:38:25,359
 

1913
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:27,309
 powers of P and unfortunately it is not

1914
00:38:25,349 --> 00:38:27,309
 

1915
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:29,890
 so while this is a very useful thing to

1916
00:38:27,299 --> 00:38:29,890
 

1917
00:38:27,309 --> 00:38:32,170
 do this does this is sort of where the

1918
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,170
 

1919
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:34,390
 strongly Rayleigh closeness breaks you

1920
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,390
 

1921
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:35,770
 can still use this notion and it's still

1922
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,770
 

1923
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:40,210
 going to be useful to you but it's not

1924
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,210
 

1925
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:42,970
 directly strongly ready the other one is

1926
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,970
 

1927
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:44,650
 certain types of conditioning so another

1928
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,650
 

1929
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:46,210
 application that people have looked at

1930
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,210
 

1931
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:49,059
 was well I want to use maybe a

1932
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,059
 

1933
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:51,940
 determinant appoint process for inducing

1934
00:38:49,049 --> 00:38:51,940
 

1935
00:38:49,059 --> 00:38:54,579
 diversity and for subsampling data for

1936
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:54,579
 

1937
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:56,319
 example for summarization but I also

1938
00:38:54,569 --> 00:38:56,319
 

1939
00:38:54,579 --> 00:38:57,970
 want to have fairness at the same time

1940
00:38:56,309 --> 00:38:57,970
 

1941
00:38:56,319 --> 00:38:59,349
 so my data is actually partitioned into

1942
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,349
 

1943
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:01,089
 different groups and I want to ensure

1944
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:01,089
 

1945
00:38:59,349 --> 00:39:02,650
 that it's ample enough from each group

1946
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:02,650
 

1947
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:05,200
 so I should not sample more than a

1948
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,200
 

1949
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:07,720
 certain but a budget from each of the

1950
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:07,720
 

1951
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,520
 groups so if you enforce that constraint

1952
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,520
 

1953
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:12,700
 and condition on seeing only subsets

1954
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:12,700
 

1955
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:15,609
 that satisfy this constraint you also

1956
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:15,609
 

1957
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:18,339
 get out of the strong Raney class so

1958
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,339
 

1959
00:39:15,609 --> 00:39:20,170
 this type of conditioning also doesn't

1960
00:39:18,329 --> 00:39:20,170
 

1961
00:39:18,339 --> 00:39:22,240
 hold anymore however you can still get

1962
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,240
 

1963
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:24,270
 results for partition functions for

1964
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:24,270
 

1965
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,270
 example

1966
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:27,260
 

1967
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:32,530
 so after having seen a little bit of the

1968
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:32,530
 

1969
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,680
 theory and sort of the indication that

1970
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,680
 

1971
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:38,140
 maybe looking at analogies to

1972
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:38,140
 

1973
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:40,780
 polynomials let's look at one concrete

1974
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:40,780
 

1975
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:42,520
 area where actually the strongly raylene

1976
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:42,520
 

1977
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:45,130
 s can be very useful and that is

1978
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:45,130
 

1979
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:49,990
 sampling how do we sample from

1980
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:49,990
 

1981
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:51,640
 negatively dependent measures for many

1982
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,640
 

1983
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:54,430
 of the like some of the instances

1984
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:54,430
 

1985
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:57,340
 there's specific samplers that work

1986
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:57,340
 

1987
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:58,660
 exactly for like this type of subfamily

1988
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:58,660
 

1989
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:00,580
 of strongly Rayleigh measures and one

1990
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:00,580
 

1991
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:04,660
 are determinantal point processes and

1992
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:04,660
 

1993
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:06,400
 there's actually a very beautiful result

1994
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:06,400
 

1995
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:08,620
 saying that you can use the eigenvalues

1996
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:08,620
 

1997
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,750
 and eigenvectors of your similarity

1998
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:10,750
 

1999
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:12,760
 matrix to do sampling with determinant

2000
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,760
 

2001
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:14,320
 or point process and the sampling works

2002
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,320
 

2003
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:16,240
 in two steps first two sample

2004
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:16,240
 

2005
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:18,550
 eigenvalues and essentially a subspace

2006
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:18,550
 

2007
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:21,460
 and then you select points according to

2008
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:21,460
 

2009
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:23,770
 the subspace that you selected however

2010
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:23,770
 

2011
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:26,140
 this needs you to do an eigen vector

2012
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,140
 

2013
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:28,510
 decomposition or if you know your matrix

2014
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:28,510
 

2015
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:31,840
 factorizes as an a transpose a then you

2016
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,840
 

2017
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:33,490
 need an SVD of a if you actually know

2018
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:33,490
 

2019
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:35,380
 the factorization of your similarity

2020
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,380
 

2021
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:37,720
 matrix or the actual vectors

2022
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:37,720
 

2023
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:40,300
 representing your items you can do a bit

2024
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:40,300
 

2025
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:41,620
 better so for example you can do what

2026
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:41,620
 

2027
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:45,550
 was also called two world

2028
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:45,550
 

2029
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:47,080
 representations for sampling based on

2030
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,080
 

2031
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:50,080
 this result there have been numerous

2032
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:50,080
 

2033
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:52,570
 approaches to accelerate the sampling in

2034
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:52,570
 

2035
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:55,300
 particular many of them built on like

2036
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,300
 

2037
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:57,550
 reducing the complexity of the matrix L

2038
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:57,550
 

2039
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:59,170
 or the complexity of the matrix a and

2040
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,170
 

2041
00:40:57,550 --> 00:41:01,300
 you can do this with various different

2042
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,300
 

2043
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:03,040
 methods you can do sketching methods on

2044
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:03,040
 

2045
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:05,530
 the matrix that somehow preserve volumes

2046
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:05,530
 

2047
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:07,740
 because that's what you care about you

2048
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,740
 

2049
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:11,230
 can do Nystrom methods you can do MC MC

2050
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:11,230
 

2051
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:13,180
 or you can do other types of two-stage

2052
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,180
 

2053
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:16,890
 sampling where I first introduced pore

2054
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:16,890
 

2055
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:19,990
 sets or do this way another type of DPP

2056
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,990
 

2057
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:23,260
 beyond that there's other approaches for

2058
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:23,260
 

2059
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:26,260
 example doing reverse sampling doing

2060
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:26,260
 

2061
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:28,390
 Kronecker approximating a matrix with a

2062
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,390
 

2063
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:30,730
 chronicle matrix and so on that also

2064
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,730
 

2065
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:32,620
 accelerates sampling so there's been a

2066
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,620
 

2067
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:34,750
 lot of work and all of these actually to

2068
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:34,750
 

2069
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:37,480
 give you both mileage and making the

2070
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:37,480
 

2071
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:38,060
 sampler faster however this works

2072
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:38,060
 

2073
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,710
 only for the

2074
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:39,710
 

2075
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:42,140
 terminal point processes because it

2076
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,140
 

2077
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:44,780
 explicitly uses the similarity matrix

2078
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:44,780
 

2079
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:46,430
 that we defined so what about general

2080
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:46,430
 

2081
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:50,050
 struggling railing measures they may not

2082
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:50,050
 

2083
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:50,050
 actually have that matrix with them

2084
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:56,980
 

2085
00:41:56,990 --> 00:42:02,420
 so one method that works for all

2086
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:02,420
 

2087
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:05,270
 strongly really matters is MCMC sampling

2088
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:05,270
 

2089
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:07,250
 Markov chain Monte Carlo and the sampler

2090
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:07,250
 

2091
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:09,740
 here is actually fairly simple so you

2092
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,740
 

2093
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:12,230
 start out with an initial set s0 and

2094
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:12,230
 

2095
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:14,990
 then what you do is you uniformly at

2096
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:14,990
 

2097
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:18,650
 random pick one item inside the set and

2098
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:18,650
 

2099
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:21,740
 one item outside the set so you pick

2100
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,740
 

2101
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:23,420
 item a inside and B outside and then you

2102
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:23,420
 

2103
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:26,060
 do one out of three things either you

2104
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:26,060
 

2105
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:28,520
 try to swap them meaning you kick a out

2106
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:28,520
 

2107
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:32,089
 of the set and you add B to the set or

2108
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:32,089
 

2109
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:34,940
 you just add B or you just remove a or

2110
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,940
 

2111
00:42:32,089 --> 00:42:36,470
 you do nothing and you do the all any of

2112
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:36,470
 

2113
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:38,030
 these with a certain probability and

2114
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:38,030
 

2115
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:39,500
 this probability is essentially given if

2116
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,500
 

2117
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:43,460
 they are defined right they give you a

2118
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:43,460
 

2119
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:46,280
 sampler for the desired measure so this

2120
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:46,280
 

2121
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:49,369
 is a very very basic MCMC Markov chain

2122
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:49,369
 

2123
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:50,869
 and if there you can do essentially the

2124
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:50,869
 

2125
00:42:49,369 --> 00:42:54,589
 same chain if you actually want to

2126
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:54,589
 

2127
00:42:50,869 --> 00:42:56,540
 condition on having only like the sets

2128
00:42:54,579 --> 00:42:56,540
 

2129
00:42:54,589 --> 00:42:58,250
 of the same cardinality so that retains

2130
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:58,250
 

2131
00:42:56,540 --> 00:43:00,950
 actually strongly really nice I could

2132
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,950
 

2133
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:04,010
 say I want a distribution but I only

2134
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:04,010
 

2135
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:05,540
 want sets of size K what you do is then

2136
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,540
 

2137
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:07,490
 you start out with a set of size K and

2138
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:07,490
 

2139
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:09,010
 you only do the swaps and you never to

2140
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,010
 

2141
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:11,869
 add or delete which will change your

2142
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,869
 

2143
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:15,680
 cardinality so it's essentially the same

2144
00:43:11,859 --> 00:43:15,680
 

2145
00:43:11,869 --> 00:43:18,170
 sampler how does it work so they say one

2146
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:18,170
 

2147
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:20,030
 thing with MCMC is that it's kind of

2148
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,030
 

2149
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:22,070
 hard to know when it has converged or

2150
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:22,070
 

2151
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:25,369
 not so let me just show you this

2152
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:25,369
 

2153
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:28,190
 empirically and theoretically so

2154
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:28,190
 

2155
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:30,589
 empirically and what I'm showing you

2156
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:30,589
 

2157
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:32,570
 here is actually applying in particular

2158
00:43:30,579 --> 00:43:32,570
 

2159
00:43:30,589 --> 00:43:34,640
 determinantal point processes to matrix

2160
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,640
 

2161
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:36,589
 approximation so we are sampling columns

2162
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:36,589
 

2163
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:38,390
 from a matrix and what I use for the

2164
00:43:36,579 --> 00:43:38,390
 

2165
00:43:36,589 --> 00:43:39,890
 convergence here is actually the matrix

2166
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:39,890
 

2167
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:42,680
 approximation error so this is already

2168
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:42,680
 

2169
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:45,260
 the application sort of down the line

2170
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:45,260
 

2171
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:47,060
 and what you see with this is that

2172
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:47,060
 

2173
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:49,099
 actually pretty quickly the sampler

2174
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:49,099
 

2175
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:51,440
 converges to a very pretty good

2176
00:43:49,089 --> 00:43:51,440
 

2177
00:43:49,099 --> 00:43:53,119
 approximation and it basically stays

2178
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:53,119
 

2179
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:56,210
 there so the convergence actually

2180
00:43:53,109 --> 00:43:56,210
 

2181
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:58,609
 empirically works quite well what about

2182
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,609
 

2183
00:43:56,210 --> 00:44:00,920
 theoretically and part in particular

2184
00:43:58,599 --> 00:44:00,920
 

2185
00:43:58,609 --> 00:44:03,500
 this was like measured error in like my

2186
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:03,500
 

2187
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:07,099
 application domain like the actual

2188
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:07,099
 

2189
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:08,720
 approximation error of the matrix so in

2190
00:44:07,089 --> 00:44:08,720
 

2191
00:44:07,099 --> 00:44:10,080
 theory what we look at is what's called

2192
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:10,080
 

2193
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,840
 the mixing time that

2194
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:12,840
 

2195
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:16,260
 in my sampler I started with an initial

2196
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:16,260
 

2197
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:18,900
 set and then I do random modifications

2198
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:18,900
 

2199
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:21,300
 to my set and after T steps I have a

2200
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:21,300
 

2201
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:23,460
 distribution for each set what is the

2202
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:23,460
 

2203
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:25,200
 probability of being at that set after T

2204
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:25,200
 

2205
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:26,670
 steps so this gives me a distribution

2206
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:26,670
 

2207
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,800
 over my sets and I want this

2208
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:28,800
 

2209
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:31,560
 distribution eventually to be

2210
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:31,560
 

2211
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,510
 essentially the MU of s that I want to

2212
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:33,510
 

2213
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:35,700
 sample from that's when my sampler has

2214
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,700
 

2215
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:38,450
 converged so what the mixing time looks

2216
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:38,450
 

2217
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:40,710
 at what is the difference between this

2218
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,710
 

2219
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:43,020
 distribution after T steps and the

2220
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:43,020
 

2221
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:44,850
 distribution that I actually want and I

2222
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:44,850
 

2223
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:47,790
 can do the same various divergences for

2224
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,790
 

2225
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:50,190
 example total variation so for example I

2226
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:50,190
 

2227
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:53,640
 could look at how many steps do I need

2228
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:53,640
 

2229
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:58,200
 from a given starting point initial set

2230
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:58,200
 

2231
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:59,940
 s until this is smaller than epsilon in

2232
00:44:58,190 --> 00:44:59,940
 

2233
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:03,780
 particular I want don't want this to

2234
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:03,780
 

2235
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:08,970
 necessarily be exponential time so this

2236
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:08,970
 

2237
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:10,890
 question was first studied for with

2238
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,890
 

2239
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:14,130
 respect to neck especially this negative

2240
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,130
 

2241
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:16,380
 dependence in combinatorics so for a

2242
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,380
 

2243
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:19,920
 class of combinatorial objects called

2244
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:19,920
 

2245
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:21,660
 balanced Metroid's where a paper an

2246
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:21,660
 

2247
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,850
 important paper by theater and Mahina in

2248
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:23,850
 

2249
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:26,450
 1992 established that this gives you

2250
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,450
 

2251
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:28,860
 fast mixing meaning something that is

2252
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,860
 

2253
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:30,690
 essentially n times K times log of 1

2254
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:30,690
 

2255
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:33,570
 over epsilon where K is the size of the

2256
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,570
 

2257
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:35,040
 set what is the matrix I'm not going to

2258
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,040
 

2259
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:36,710
 give you the formal definition you can

2260
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:36,710
 

2261
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:39,180
 think of it as a combinatorial

2262
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:39,180
 

2263
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:42,300
 generalization of linear dependence in

2264
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:42,300
 

2265
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:45,450
 linear algebra so basically what you

2266
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:45,450
 

2267
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:47,070
 have is a collection of subsets and you

2268
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,070
 

2269
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:50,040
 were to have a uniform distribution over

2270
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:50,040
 

2271
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:53,250
 this collection an example would be the

2272
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:53,250
 

2273
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:54,330
 spanning trees that we had or if you

2274
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,330
 

2275
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:56,130
 think of the example with the

2276
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,130
 

2277
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:58,770
 coffeeshops if I say I'm going to one

2278
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,770
 

2279
00:45:56,130 --> 00:46:00,630
 coffee shop one lunch place and one

2280
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,630
 

2281
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:02,940
 dinner place this would also be all the

2282
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:02,940
 

2283
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:05,910
 feasible sets with all F size 3 and that

2284
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:05,910
 

2285
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:07,440
 would also be Metroid so a special place

2286
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,440
 

2287
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:10,320
 a class of this matrix or the so-called

2288
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:10,320
 

2289
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:13,320
 balance matrix that exactly exhibit

2290
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:13,320
 

2291
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:17,910
 these negative dependence properties so

2292
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:17,910
 

2293
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:20,850
 after this important paper in 2016

2294
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:20,850
 

2295
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:22,500
 Inari at I'll generalize this result to

2296
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,500
 

2297
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:23,720
 sample from determinantal point

2298
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:23,720
 

2299
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:26,190
 processes and more generally any

2300
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:26,190
 

2301
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:28,740
 strongly Rayleigh distribution if you

2302
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:28,740
 

2303
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:31,500
 condition on cardinality so if I say I

2304
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:31,500
 

2305
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:32,900
 want a fixed cardinality K then I can

2306
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:32,900
 

2307
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:35,910
 essentially generalize those

2308
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:35,910
 

2309
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:38,460
 combinatorial results to arbitrary

2310
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:38,460
 

2311
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:41,630
 strongly ready measures and again it's

2312
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:41,630
 

2313
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:44,820
 essentially the same kind of mixing time

2314
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:44,820
 

2315
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:45,920
 in particular it's log of 1 over epsilon

2316
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:45,920
 

2317
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:48,330
 that's what we want

2318
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:48,330
 

2319
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,620
 now what about arbitrary strongly

2320
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,620
 

2321
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:52,230
 Rayleigh measures where the sets can

2322
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:52,230
 

2323
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:56,250
 have arbitrary sizes so in the same year

2324
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:56,250
 

2325
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:57,750
 we generalize the result to hold for

2326
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,750
 

2327
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:59,580
 arbitrary strongly Rayleigh measures

2328
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:59,580
 

2329
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:01,470
 with exactly the Markov chain that I

2330
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:01,470
 

2331
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:03,990
 showed you so basically just this simple

2332
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:03,990
 

2333
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:05,220
 pick a set item inside outside and try

2334
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:05,220
 

2335
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:08,550
 to swap them so it's actually very

2336
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:08,550
 

2337
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:09,900
 simple to implement it just for

2338
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:09,900
 

2339
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:11,610
 illustration I want to give you an

2340
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:11,610
 

2341
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:16,500
 intuition how do you actually prove this

2342
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:16,500
 

2343
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:18,450
 result because it uses again essentially

2344
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:18,450
 

2345
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:21,180
 the polynomials to prove something about

2346
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:21,180
 

2347
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:23,790
 the distribution so how do you go from

2348
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:23,790
 

2349
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:26,760
 being able to sample k out of n to be

2350
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:26,760
 

2351
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:30,300
 able to sample any kind of subset out of

2352
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:30,300
 

2353
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:31,860
 n and the idea is actually fairly simple

2354
00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:31,860
 

2355
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:34,800
 so what you do is you start out with

2356
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:34,800
 

2357
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:37,020
 your n items that's your universe and we

2358
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:37,020
 

2359
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:39,330
 duplicate that set so we essentially

2360
00:47:37,010 --> 00:47:39,330
 

2361
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:42,090
 create a shadow set and then instead of

2362
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:42,090
 

2363
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:45,600
 sampling anything out of enemy sample n

2364
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:45,600
 

2365
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:47,940
 out of 2n that's fixed number out of a

2366
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:47,940
 

2367
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:51,270
 fixed number so this we can do under

2368
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:51,270
 

2369
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:54,060
 certain conditions and then what we look

2370
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:54,060
 

2371
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:55,830
 at as our actual sample is only diets

2372
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:55,830
 

2373
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:57,930
 and selected items that fall on the left

2374
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:57,930
 

2375
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:59,550
 hand side and on the left hand side I

2376
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,550
 

2377
00:47:57,930 --> 00:48:04,470
 can find anything between 0 and n

2378
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:04,470
 

2379
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:05,970
 because I do n out of 2 n so we do and

2380
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:05,970
 

2381
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:07,590
 out of 2 and the only thing that I

2382
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,590
 

2383
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:09,600
 really have to define here now and

2384
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:09,600
 

2385
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:11,250
 that's kind of the tricky thing is what

2386
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:11,250
 

2387
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:14,100
 is the distribution on the other part

2388
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:14,100
 

2389
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:15,930
 the shadow part so this distribution has

2390
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:15,930
 

2391
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:17,760
 to satisfy two things the first thing is

2392
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,760
 

2393
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:21,870
 that if I only look at my left hand side

2394
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:21,870
 

2395
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:24,240
 it better be the same distribution as I

2396
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:24,240
 

2397
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:25,500
 was starting out with so basically the

2398
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:25,500
 

2399
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:27,930
 marginals on the left hand side should

2400
00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:27,930
 

2401
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:29,460
 be the correct ones the second thing is

2402
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,460
 

2403
00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:30,720
 that the joint distribution still whole

2404
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:30,720
 

2405
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:31,180
 should have this strongly Rayleigh

2406
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:31,180
 

2407
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,319
 property

2408
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:32,319
 

2409
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:35,650
 because otherwise I do not necessarily

2410
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:35,650
 

2411
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:38,859
 can use the fast sampling results here

2412
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:38,859
 

2413
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:40,960
 so those two need to hold and the way

2414
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:40,960
 

2415
00:48:38,859 --> 00:48:44,319
 you can define this kind of distribution

2416
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:44,319
 

2417
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:47,980
 is by using actually modifications of

2418
00:48:44,309 --> 00:48:47,980
 

2419
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:49,900
 the generating polynomial and the

2420
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:49,900
 

2421
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:57,339
 especially the operation you use here so

2422
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:57,339
 

2423
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:59,170
 called symmetric homogenization so to

2424
00:48:57,329 --> 00:48:59,170
 

2425
00:48:57,339 --> 00:49:01,540
 summarize what I told you about sampling

2426
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,540
 

2427
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:03,579
 is there's many specialized samplers for

2428
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:03,579
 

2429
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:06,040
 strong Rayleigh measures but to have

2430
00:49:03,569 --> 00:49:06,040
 

2431
00:49:03,579 --> 00:49:08,710
 some like one global sampling result for

2432
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:08,710
 

2433
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:11,109
 strongly ready measures we can use MCMC

2434
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:11,109
 

2435
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:13,210
 methods and the proof at its core

2436
00:49:11,099 --> 00:49:13,210
 

2437
00:49:11,109 --> 00:49:15,630
 actually essentially reduces everything

2438
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,630
 

2439
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:18,160
 down to a negative correlation

2440
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:18,160
 

2441
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:21,130
 inequality that's all it so basically it

2442
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:21,130
 

2443
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:27,550
 needs negative association to hold so it

2444
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:27,550
 

2445
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:29,260
 needs this strong readiness so what we

2446
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:29,260
 

2447
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:31,450
 see from this is that we actually get

2448
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:31,450
 

2449
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:34,569
 from negative dependence we get fast

2450
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,569
 

2451
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:38,200
 sampling algorithms generically with a

2452
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:38,200
 

2453
00:49:34,569 --> 00:49:40,270
 strong Raney property the second thing

2454
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:40,270
 

2455
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:42,099
 is that we can actually especially for

2456
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:42,099
 

2457
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:44,260
 DPP's we can accelerate that sampler

2458
00:49:42,089 --> 00:49:44,260
 

2459
00:49:42,099 --> 00:49:47,500
 further by accelerating each iteration

2460
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:47,500
 

2461
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:49,270
 of the sampler so we know we need like

2462
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:49,270
 

2463
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:53,650
 not too many steps so each step can now

2464
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:53,650
 

2465
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:56,049
 be further accelerated the results on

2466
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:56,049
 

2467
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:58,569
 TPP sampling also generalize to some

2468
00:49:56,039 --> 00:49:58,569
 

2469
00:49:56,049 --> 00:50:01,690
 extent to continuous sampling for DPP's

2470
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:01,690
 

2471
00:49:58,569 --> 00:50:03,460
 I just want to mention that and another

2472
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,460
 

2473
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:05,500
 thing I want to mention is that strongly

2474
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:05,500
 

2475
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:08,470
 Rayleigh is sufficient for fast mixing

2476
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:08,470
 

2477
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:10,030
 in Markov chains it's not sufficient so

2478
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:10,030
 

2479
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:11,890
 there's some very recent work showing

2480
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:11,890
 

2481
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:14,470
 that actually if you have what is called

2482
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,470
 

2483
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:16,960
 complete low concavity or strongly low

2484
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:16,960
 

2485
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:19,150
 concave distributions they also give you

2486
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:19,150
 

2487
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:22,299
 fast sampling and it's a broader class

2488
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:22,299
 

2489
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:25,030
 the results are a little bit trickier

2490
00:50:22,289 --> 00:50:25,030
 

2491
00:50:22,299 --> 00:50:29,020
 but yeah this is some interesting new

2492
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:29,020
 

2493
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:30,849
 work finally going even broader there

2494
00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:30,849
 

2495
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:32,770
 has been also several recent works on

2496
00:50:30,839 --> 00:50:32,770
 

2497
00:50:30,849 --> 00:50:34,480
 sampling from lakhs of modular

2498
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,480
 

2499
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:36,460
 distributions meaning just satisfying

2500
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:36,460
 

2501
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,960
 this lattice condition the weaker one

2502
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:37,960
 

2503
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:41,109
 that I introduced with positive

2504
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:41,109
 

2505
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:43,050
 dependence so those results are mostly

2506
00:50:41,099 --> 00:50:43,050
 

2507
00:50:41,109 --> 00:50:44,880
 conditional or empirically

2508
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,880
 

2509
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:47,550
 they don't generically get fast sampling

2510
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:47,550
 

2511
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:52,740
 but there's also a lot of interesting

2512
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:52,740
 

2513
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:55,170
 recent work in this area with this I

2514
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:55,170
 

2515
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:57,570
 would like to just summarize so we saw

2516
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,570
 

2517
00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:59,970
 negative dependence comes up in various

2518
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,970
 

2519
00:50:57,570 --> 00:51:01,290
 ways in machine learning it actually

2520
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,290
 

2521
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:04,200
 gives you lots of beneficial properties

2522
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,200
 

2523
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:06,330
 it's fairly easy to reason with if you

2524
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:06,330
 

2525
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:08,580
 know there's an interesting and very

2526
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,580
 

2527
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:11,010
 powerful and deep relation to the theory

2528
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:11,010
 

2529
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:12,450
 of polynomials and this gives you

2530
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,450
 

2531
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:14,400
 algorithmic results it gives you

2532
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,400
 

2533
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:16,710
 concentration results and many other

2534
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:16,710
 

2535
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,300
 things in particular it gives you fast

2536
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:18,300
 

2537
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:21,210
 mixing Markov chains that you can do

2538
00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:21,210
 

2539
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:24,470
 sampling fairly easily so we will now

2540
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,470
 

2541
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:27,720
 take a short break for about ten minutes

2542
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:27,720
 

2543
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:30,120
 10:15 12:05 after that we'll talk more

2544
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:30,120
 

2545
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:32,150
 about specific applications and

2546
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:32,150
 

2547
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:35,390
 partition functions and several other

00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:35,390
 

2549
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:35,390
 powerful implications

2613
01:04:50,750 --> 01:05:04,040
 service to our so okay welcome to the

01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:04,040
 

2615
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:08,140
 second part of the tutorial or negative

2616
01:05:04,030 --> 01:05:08,140
 

2617
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:09,680
 dependence stable polynomials etc so I'm

2618
01:05:08,130 --> 01:05:09,680
 

2619
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:13,369
 that's where we are

2620
01:05:09,670 --> 01:05:13,369
 

2621
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:15,470
 so first parts definitely just gave you

2622
01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:15,470
 

2623
01:05:13,369 --> 01:05:17,829
 introduction some beautiful theoretical

2624
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:17,829
 

2625
01:05:15,470 --> 01:05:23,569
 properties I'm going to just talk about

2626
01:05:17,819 --> 01:05:23,569
 

2627
01:05:17,829 --> 01:05:27,859
 two simple theoretical questions of

2628
01:05:23,559 --> 01:05:27,859
 

2629
01:05:23,569 --> 01:05:33,410
 great value in practice before showing

2630
01:05:27,849 --> 01:05:33,410
 

2631
01:05:27,859 --> 01:05:35,440
 you some concrete applications and my

2632
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,440
 

2633
01:05:33,410 --> 01:05:37,970
 aim in showing you some simple

2634
01:05:35,430 --> 01:05:37,970
 

2635
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:41,119
 theoretical stuff is just to be gained

2636
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:41,119
 

2637
01:05:37,970 --> 01:05:43,819
 some further insight about some of the

2638
01:05:41,109 --> 01:05:43,819
 

2639
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:47,240
 power of this mathematical machinery

2640
01:05:43,809 --> 01:05:47,240
 

2641
01:05:43,819 --> 01:05:52,549
 that Stephanie just outlined here and I

2642
01:05:47,230 --> 01:05:52,549
 

2643
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:54,859
 will then just go through a diverse set

2644
01:05:52,539 --> 01:05:54,859
 

2645
01:05:52,549 --> 01:05:57,380
 of applications to just get your

2646
01:05:54,849 --> 01:05:57,380
 

2647
01:05:54,859 --> 01:05:58,849
 imagination going about what all other

2648
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:58,849
 

2649
01:05:57,380 --> 01:06:02,180
 things you could do in machine learning

2650
01:05:58,839 --> 01:06:02,180
 

2651
01:05:58,849 --> 01:06:04,490
 with this it's just some set of

2652
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:04,490
 

2653
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:07,430
 applications where I happen to have some

2654
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:07,430
 

2655
01:06:04,490 --> 01:06:09,500
 more input on hence I'm sharing those

2656
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:09,500
 

2657
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:11,660
 with you it's just to stoke your

2658
01:06:09,490 --> 01:06:11,660
 

2659
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:13,790
 imagination for all sorts of things you

2660
01:06:11,650 --> 01:06:13,790
 

2661
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:19,430
 could do with this paradigm of thinking

2662
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:19,430
 

2663
01:06:13,790 --> 01:06:21,290
 and I will then exit after the

2664
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:21,290
 

2665
01:06:19,430 --> 01:06:23,750
 applications by telling you some recent

2666
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:23,750
 

2667
01:06:21,290 --> 01:06:26,750
 perspectives on at least on the theory

2668
01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:26,750
 

2669
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:29,470
 side how things are expanding while also

2670
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:29,470
 

2671
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:32,369
 outlining potentially some more broad

2672
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:32,369
 

2673
01:06:29,470 --> 01:06:35,200
 things for future outlook on this topic

2674
01:06:32,359 --> 01:06:35,200
 

2675
01:06:32,369 --> 01:06:37,630
 and if any of you is particularly

2676
01:06:35,190 --> 01:06:37,630
 

2677
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:40,119
 interested in purely direct you know

2678
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:40,119
 

2679
01:06:37,630 --> 01:06:42,069
 open questions in the area try to catch

2680
01:06:40,109 --> 01:06:42,069
 

2681
01:06:40,119 --> 01:06:44,410
 me it means not right after the tutorial

2682
01:06:42,059 --> 01:06:44,410
 

2683
01:06:42,069 --> 01:06:48,720
 because I gotta eat but at any other

2684
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:48,720
 

2685
01:06:44,410 --> 01:06:53,319
 time during nips so okay here we are

2686
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:53,319
 

2687
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:55,300
 fly by theory just very simple so very

2688
01:06:53,309 --> 01:06:55,300
 

2689
01:06:53,319 --> 01:06:58,050
 simple stuff I'm not going to go into

2690
01:06:55,290 --> 01:06:58,050
 

2691
01:06:55,300 --> 01:07:00,310
 the details because details are

2692
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:00,310
 

2693
01:06:58,050 --> 01:07:03,240
 fascinating in themselves but I just

2694
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:03,240
 

2695
01:07:00,310 --> 01:07:07,180
 want to briefly expose you to some

2696
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:07,180
 

2697
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:08,589
 simple theoretical ideas so what I'm

2698
01:07:07,170 --> 01:07:08,589
 

2699
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:09,940
 going to talk about as is partition

2700
01:07:08,579 --> 01:07:09,940
 

2701
01:07:08,589 --> 01:07:11,650
 functions which is basically the

2702
01:07:09,930 --> 01:07:11,650
 

2703
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:15,420
 normalization constant of your

2704
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:15,420
 

2705
01:07:11,650 --> 01:07:18,339
 probability distribution and in

2706
01:07:15,410 --> 01:07:18,339
 

2707
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:23,290
 particular algorithmic task there I

2708
01:07:18,329 --> 01:07:23,290
 

2709
01:07:18,339 --> 01:07:25,630
 happen to look at also so just for

2710
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,630
 

2711
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:27,130
 definition the job of computing a

2712
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:27,130
 

2713
01:07:25,630 --> 01:07:29,230
 partition function also known as the

2714
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:29,230
 

2715
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:32,710
 normalization constant of a distribution

2716
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:32,710
 

2717
01:07:29,230 --> 01:07:34,510
 is so if mu was like the unnormalized

2718
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:34,510
 

2719
01:07:32,710 --> 01:07:36,369
 measure so in Stephanie's part there was

2720
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:36,369
 

2721
01:07:34,510 --> 01:07:39,069
 a mu you could think of it as let's say

2722
01:07:36,359 --> 01:07:39,069
 

2723
01:07:36,369 --> 01:07:42,450
 a none normalization measure some just

2724
01:07:39,059 --> 01:07:42,450
 

2725
01:07:39,069 --> 01:07:44,800
 non-negative function that you normalize

2726
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:44,800
 

2727
01:07:42,450 --> 01:07:48,609
 over of course by summing over all

2728
01:07:44,790 --> 01:07:48,609
 

2729
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:53,109
 possible subsets there's two to the N of

2730
01:07:48,599 --> 01:07:53,109
 

2731
01:07:48,609 --> 01:07:56,980
 those these things are typically for the

2732
01:07:53,099 --> 01:07:56,980
 

2733
01:07:53,109 --> 01:07:59,710
 general discrete case intractable more

2734
01:07:56,970 --> 01:07:59,710
 

2735
01:07:56,980 --> 01:08:01,329
 broadly this normalization constant the

2736
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:01,329
 

2737
01:07:59,710 --> 01:08:02,980
 way it occurs for for maybe most

2738
01:08:01,319 --> 01:08:02,980
 

2739
01:08:01,329 --> 01:08:06,250
 familiar to people in machine learning

2740
01:08:02,970 --> 01:08:06,250
 

2741
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:09,609
 either within graphical models or within

2742
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:09,609
 

2743
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:13,180
 just when doing Bayesian inference where

2744
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:13,180
 

2745
01:08:09,609 --> 01:08:14,170
 it comes as the posterior inference so

2746
01:08:13,170 --> 01:08:14,170
 

2747
01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:16,239
 these are typically intractable

2748
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:16,239
 

2749
01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:18,730
 quantities and hence one devotes a lot

2750
01:08:16,229 --> 01:08:18,730
 

2751
01:08:16,239 --> 01:08:24,819
 of energy trying to approximate them get

2752
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:24,819
 

2753
01:08:18,730 --> 01:08:28,420
 around them in one way or the other and

2754
01:08:24,809 --> 01:08:28,420
 

2755
01:08:24,819 --> 01:08:31,120
 of course what I'm the reason I'm

2756
01:08:28,410 --> 01:08:31,120
 

2757
01:08:28,420 --> 01:08:35,350
 mentioning this here is that quite

2758
01:08:31,110 --> 01:08:35,350
 

2759
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:38,080
 interestingly once again this beautiful

2760
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:38,080
 

2761
01:08:35,350 --> 01:08:42,549
 property of negative dependence and

2762
01:08:38,070 --> 01:08:42,549
 

2763
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:45,130
 stable polynomials helps you

2764
01:08:42,539 --> 01:08:45,130
 

2765
01:08:42,549 --> 01:08:47,109
 come up with powerful approximation

2766
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:47,109
 

2767
01:08:45,130 --> 01:08:51,480
 algorithms to approximate these

2768
01:08:47,099 --> 01:08:51,480
 

2769
01:08:47,109 --> 01:08:51,480
 otherwise intractable looking quantities

2770
01:08:54,379 --> 01:08:54,379
 

2771
01:08:54,389 --> 01:09:00,849
 partial hope just from this potentially

2772
01:08:58,349 --> 01:09:00,849
 

2773
01:08:58,359 --> 01:09:02,920
 only exception is there a sort of minor

2774
01:09:00,839 --> 01:09:02,920
 

2775
01:09:00,849 --> 01:09:06,549
 twists of this exception that exists in

2776
01:09:02,910 --> 01:09:06,549
 

2777
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:08,259
 the strongly Rayleigh land but morally

2778
01:09:06,539 --> 01:09:08,259
 

2779
01:09:06,549 --> 01:09:09,969
 they are pretty close to this exception

2780
01:09:08,249 --> 01:09:09,969
 

2781
01:09:08,259 --> 01:09:11,799
 that nature makes but just to get an

2782
01:09:09,959 --> 01:09:11,799
 

2783
01:09:09,969 --> 01:09:13,809
 insight that hey there is some hope for

2784
01:09:11,789 --> 01:09:13,809
 

2785
01:09:11,799 --> 01:09:17,020
 partition functions if you are looking

2786
01:09:13,799 --> 01:09:17,020
 

2787
01:09:13,809 --> 01:09:19,420
 at a determinantal point process then

2788
01:09:17,010 --> 01:09:19,420
 

2789
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:22,679
 the partition function is just the sum

2790
01:09:19,410 --> 01:09:22,679
 

2791
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:25,210
 of those determinants over all subsets

2792
01:09:22,669 --> 01:09:25,210
 

2793
01:09:22,679 --> 01:09:28,809
 whoa it happens to have that awesome

2794
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:28,809
 

2795
01:09:25,210 --> 01:09:33,449
 closed form formula that's a rare thing

2796
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:33,449
 

2797
01:09:28,809 --> 01:09:38,619
 okay but still it's pretty amazing and

2798
01:09:33,439 --> 01:09:38,619
 

2799
01:09:33,449 --> 01:09:40,359
 this beauty is behind many of the nice

2800
01:09:38,609 --> 01:09:40,359
 

2801
01:09:38,619 --> 01:09:46,089
 things one ends up being able to do with

2802
01:09:40,349 --> 01:09:46,089
 

2803
01:09:40,359 --> 01:09:51,009
 DPP's similar luxury of course does not

2804
01:09:46,079 --> 01:09:51,009
 

2805
01:09:46,089 --> 01:09:53,199
 hold for general sr measures or the

2806
01:09:50,999 --> 01:09:53,199
 

2807
01:09:51,009 --> 01:09:57,489
 exponentiated version of sr measures

2808
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:57,489
 

2809
01:09:53,199 --> 01:09:59,290
 that Stephanie had mentioned but that

2810
01:09:57,479 --> 01:09:59,290
 

2811
01:09:57,489 --> 01:10:00,550
 doesn't mean we stop and give up because

2812
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:00,550
 

2813
01:09:59,290 --> 01:10:02,739
 it seems something special is happening

2814
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:02,739
 

2815
01:10:00,550 --> 01:10:06,460
 for determinants okay it's mostly linear

2816
01:10:02,729 --> 01:10:06,460
 

2817
01:10:02,739 --> 01:10:08,380
 algebra but actually these sr measures

2818
01:10:06,450 --> 01:10:08,380
 

2819
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:10,300
 they have some several properties

2820
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:10,300
 

2821
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:12,159
 intimately in common with the

2822
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:12,159
 

2823
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:17,409
 determinant l1 so maybe one can do

2824
01:10:12,149 --> 01:10:17,409
 

2825
01:10:12,159 --> 01:10:21,010
 something and the answer is yes in fact

2826
01:10:17,399 --> 01:10:21,010
 

2827
01:10:17,409 --> 01:10:22,780
 you can and I'm not going to tell the

2828
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,780
 

2829
01:10:21,010 --> 01:10:24,489
 details but of course this is a tutorial

2830
01:10:22,770 --> 01:10:24,489
 

2831
01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:26,469
 so I just want to expose you to the

2832
01:10:24,479 --> 01:10:26,469
 

2833
01:10:24,489 --> 01:10:31,449
 right keywords and Google can educate

2834
01:10:26,459 --> 01:10:31,449
 

2835
01:10:26,469 --> 01:10:33,489
 you after that and of course some key

2836
01:10:31,439 --> 01:10:33,489
 

2837
01:10:31,449 --> 01:10:35,079
 concepts so that you can also put the

2838
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:35,079
 

2839
01:10:33,489 --> 01:10:38,260
 search results in context when you

2840
01:10:35,069 --> 01:10:38,260
 

2841
01:10:35,079 --> 01:10:42,579
 search for them by using properties of

2842
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:42,579
 

2843
01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:47,139
 stable polynomials these crazy-looking

2844
01:10:42,569 --> 01:10:47,139
 

2845
01:10:42,579 --> 01:10:48,969
 quantities can be approximated within a

2846
01:10:47,129 --> 01:10:48,969
 

2847
01:10:47,139 --> 01:10:49,650
 constant factor of course it's e to the

2848
01:10:48,959 --> 01:10:49,650
 

2849
01:10:48,969 --> 01:10:53,040
 N

2850
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:53,040
 

2851
01:10:49,650 --> 01:10:55,170
 potential it's not so bad because

2852
01:10:53,030 --> 01:10:55,170
 

2853
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:57,540
 remember Stephanie made analogy of these

2854
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:57,540
 

2855
01:10:55,170 --> 01:11:00,330
 with like lakhs of modular so if you

2856
01:10:57,530 --> 01:11:00,330
 

2857
01:10:57,540 --> 01:11:03,350
 were to take log of stuff that end in

2858
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:03,350
 

2859
01:11:00,330 --> 01:11:06,719
 the e to the N would come downstairs and

2860
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:06,719
 

2861
01:11:03,350 --> 01:11:08,159
 without exploiting the stable property

2862
01:11:06,709 --> 01:11:08,159
 

2863
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:12,620
 it's not easy to get such an

2864
01:11:08,149 --> 01:11:12,620
 

2865
01:11:08,159 --> 01:11:17,969
 approximation so it's a pretty awesome

2866
01:11:12,610 --> 01:11:17,969
 

2867
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:20,070
 deterministic approximation I'll give

2868
01:11:17,959 --> 01:11:20,070
 

2869
01:11:17,969 --> 01:11:22,409
 you a concrete example also okay so that

2870
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:22,409
 

2871
01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:25,739
 you can appreciate it slightly in

2872
01:11:22,399 --> 01:11:25,739
 

2873
01:11:22,409 --> 01:11:28,949
 greater detail but the key behind this

2874
01:11:25,729 --> 01:11:28,949
 

2875
01:11:25,739 --> 01:11:33,900
 is actually brilliant piece of work done

2876
01:11:28,939 --> 01:11:33,900
 

2877
01:11:28,949 --> 01:11:37,590
 by leonid good widths in 2006 he kind of

2878
01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:37,590
 

2879
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:39,570
 changed the way or he brought the stable

2880
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:39,570
 

2881
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:42,420
 polynomials more into mainstream because

2882
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:42,420
 

2883
01:11:39,570 --> 01:11:44,340
 he solved he came up with a new proof of

2884
01:11:42,410 --> 01:11:44,340
 

2885
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:46,350
 an eighty-year-old conjecture by

2886
01:11:44,330 --> 01:11:46,350
 

2887
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:48,060
 applying the machinery of stable

2888
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:48,060
 

2889
01:11:46,350 --> 01:11:51,330
 polynomials in a very creative manner

2890
01:11:48,050 --> 01:11:51,330
 

2891
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:52,770
 and his motivation was to approximate

2892
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:52,770
 

2893
01:11:51,330 --> 01:11:55,650
 partition functions essentially that's

2894
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:55,650
 

2895
01:11:52,770 --> 01:12:01,110
 what was happening and show you that

2896
01:11:55,640 --> 01:12:01,110
 

2897
01:11:55,650 --> 01:12:04,760
 precisely just like I said it's view in

2898
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:04,760
 

2899
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:07,530
 fly by view it ends up trying to solve

2900
01:12:04,750 --> 01:12:07,530
 

2901
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:09,330
 take the approximation problem so that

2902
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:09,330
 

2903
01:12:07,530 --> 01:12:12,540
 approximation problem of computing the

2904
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:12,540
 

2905
01:12:09,330 --> 01:12:14,640
 partition function is related to trying

2906
01:12:12,530 --> 01:12:14,640
 

2907
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:15,510
 to find the minimization of this

2908
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:15,510
 

2909
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:18,540
 polynomial

2910
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:18,540
 

2911
01:12:15,510 --> 01:12:23,280
 oh well that product of LZ is being

2912
01:12:18,530 --> 01:12:23,280
 

2913
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:25,909
 positive now positive zi you can just

2914
01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:25,909
 

2915
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:28,380
 replace it with a to the Y I right and

2916
01:12:25,899 --> 01:12:28,380
 

2917
01:12:25,909 --> 01:12:31,170
 what you end up getting because of the

2918
01:12:28,370 --> 01:12:31,170
 

2919
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:32,960
 property of real stability is that this

2920
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:32,960
 

2921
01:12:31,170 --> 01:12:36,120
 is actually a convex optimization

2922
01:12:32,950 --> 01:12:36,120
 

2923
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:38,909
 problem it's in fact what people call

2924
01:12:36,110 --> 01:12:38,909
 

2925
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:40,710
 geometric program so he takes that

2926
01:12:38,899 --> 01:12:40,710
 

2927
01:12:38,909 --> 01:12:43,530
 intractable problem comes up with a

2928
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:43,530
 

2929
01:12:40,710 --> 01:12:46,020
 convex relaxation which intimately uses

2930
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:46,020
 

2931
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:47,760
 the stability property and then he is

2932
01:12:46,010 --> 01:12:47,760
 

2933
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:50,969
 able to prove some properties about the

2934
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:50,969
 

2935
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:55,440
 convex relaxation from how from that he

2936
01:12:50,959 --> 01:12:55,440
 

2937
01:12:50,969 --> 01:12:57,750
 can recover an approximation so here is

2938
01:12:55,430 --> 01:12:57,750
 

2939
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:59,830
 a concrete example it's a theoretical

2940
01:12:57,740 --> 01:12:59,830
 

2941
01:12:57,750 --> 01:13:01,510
 example but it

2942
01:12:59,820 --> 01:13:01,510
 

2943
01:12:59,830 --> 01:13:07,000
 kind of hopefully gets the point across

2944
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:07,000
 

2945
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:10,420
 to you a little bit so an object that is

2946
01:13:06,990 --> 01:13:10,420
 

2947
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:16,570
 greatly intrigued people who swing this

2948
01:13:10,410 --> 01:13:16,570
 

2949
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:18,100
 way is matrix permanent and it is used

2950
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:18,100
 

2951
01:13:16,570 --> 01:13:21,150
 to count the number of perfect matchings

2952
01:13:18,090 --> 01:13:21,150
 

2953
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:21,150
 in a bipartite graph

2954
01:13:21,890 --> 01:13:21,890
 

2955
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:27,250
 so in some sense in the simplest setting

2956
01:13:25,770 --> 01:13:27,250
 

2957
01:13:25,780 --> 01:13:29,950
 partition function can also be thought

2958
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:29,950
 

2959
01:13:27,250 --> 01:13:32,860
 of sounds so solving a counting problem

2960
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:32,860
 

2961
01:13:29,950 --> 01:13:36,070
 how many such objects are there so it's

2962
01:13:32,850 --> 01:13:36,070
 

2963
01:13:32,860 --> 01:13:37,990
 it's it's a friend of the determinant in

2964
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:37,990
 

2965
01:13:36,070 --> 01:13:39,640
 case somebody I hope everybody has at

2966
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:39,640
 

2967
01:13:37,990 --> 01:13:43,060
 least heard of the permanent if not here

2968
01:13:39,630 --> 01:13:43,060
 

2969
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:45,070
 it is in your face if if the summation

2970
01:13:43,050 --> 01:13:45,070
 

2971
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:47,950
 had then alternating character there

2972
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:47,950
 

2973
01:13:45,070 --> 01:13:50,410
 like minus 1 to the power of Sigma it

2974
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:50,410
 

2975
01:13:47,950 --> 01:13:52,060
 would be the determinant that thing ends

2976
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,060
 

2977
01:13:50,410 --> 01:13:54,180
 up having a closed form formula you

2978
01:13:52,050 --> 01:13:54,180
 

2979
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:57,760
 replace the alternating signs of the

2980
01:13:54,170 --> 01:13:57,760
 

2981
01:13:54,180 --> 01:14:00,700
 these products with just a plus 1 poof

2982
01:13:57,750 --> 01:14:00,700
 

2983
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:02,770
 it becomes hard to compute I mean not

2984
01:14:00,690 --> 01:14:02,770
 

2985
01:14:00,700 --> 01:14:04,750
 not so surprising but that's what is

2986
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:04,750
 

2987
01:14:02,770 --> 01:14:06,640
 fascinating a variety of people in a

2988
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:06,640
 

2989
01:14:04,750 --> 01:14:12,580
 variety of areas and it still fascinates

2990
01:14:06,630 --> 01:14:12,580
 

2991
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:15,160
 people including me so this was leonid

2992
01:14:12,570 --> 01:14:15,160
 

2993
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:18,640
 good wassailia permanents approximating

2994
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:18,640
 

2995
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:22,330
 this quantity which seems to have n

2996
01:14:18,630 --> 01:14:22,330
 

2997
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:25,030
 factorial terms so not one of course

2998
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:25,030
 

2999
01:14:22,330 --> 01:14:27,940
 compute n factorial terms why are the

3000
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:27,940
 

3001
01:14:25,030 --> 01:14:30,760
 magic of stable polynomials and what he

3002
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:30,760
 

3003
01:14:27,940 --> 01:14:32,620
 does is this is that property of

3004
01:14:30,750 --> 01:14:32,620
 

3005
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:34,870
 repeated differentiation that Stephanie

3006
01:14:32,610 --> 01:14:34,870
 

3007
01:14:32,620 --> 01:14:37,510
 said differentiate enough number of

3008
01:14:34,860 --> 01:14:37,510
 

3009
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:41,830
 times to extract the coefficient of your

3010
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:41,830
 

3011
01:14:37,510 --> 01:14:44,410
 desire so good with side iya was right

3012
01:14:41,820 --> 01:14:44,410
 

3013
01:14:41,830 --> 01:14:47,200
 down that polynomial down their product

3014
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:47,200
 

3015
01:14:44,410 --> 01:14:49,530
 over those of linear terms each of those

3016
01:14:47,190 --> 01:14:49,530
 

3017
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:53,220
 linear terms in a stable polynomial

3018
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:53,220
 

3019
01:14:49,530 --> 01:14:55,780
 clearly linear and hence stable their

3020
01:14:53,210 --> 01:14:55,780
 

3021
01:14:53,220 --> 01:14:58,900
 product of stable polynomials is stable

3022
01:14:55,770 --> 01:14:58,900
 

3023
01:14:55,780 --> 01:15:01,870
 so that whole product is stable if you

3024
01:14:58,890 --> 01:15:01,870
 

3025
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:05,830
 differentiate it n times set whatever

3026
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:05,830
 

3027
01:15:01,870 --> 01:15:07,300
 junk remains to 0 the coefficient of the

3028
01:15:05,820 --> 01:15:07,300
 

3029
01:15:05,830 --> 01:15:09,580
 coefficient that you can extract is the

3030
01:15:07,290 --> 01:15:09,580
 

3031
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:12,570
 permanent so that's a very clever way to

3032
01:15:09,570 --> 01:15:12,570
 

3033
01:15:09,580 --> 01:15:12,570
 write a permanent

3034
01:15:12,690 --> 01:15:12,690
 

3035
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:16,960
 the fact that he could now write the

3036
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:16,960
 

3037
01:15:14,290 --> 01:15:20,410
 permanent by repeated differentiation of

3038
01:15:16,950 --> 01:15:20,410
 

3039
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:22,060
 a stable polynomial and we know that if

3040
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,060
 

3041
01:15:20,410 --> 01:15:23,740
 you start with a stable polynomial

3042
01:15:22,050 --> 01:15:23,740
 

3043
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:26,250
 repeated differentiation keeps you

3044
01:15:23,730 --> 01:15:26,250
 

3045
01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:29,800
 stable is making a very strong statement

3046
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:29,800
 

3047
01:15:26,250 --> 01:15:33,790
 about what how these coefficients can

3048
01:15:29,790 --> 01:15:33,790
 

3049
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:37,840
 behave so in some sense in the whole

3050
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:37,840
 

3051
01:15:33,790 --> 01:15:40,630
 business of stable polynomials the fact

3052
01:15:37,830 --> 01:15:40,630
 

3053
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:43,150
 that the roots are positive gives you a

3054
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:43,150
 

3055
01:15:40,630 --> 01:15:46,090
 very strong number of implicit

3056
01:15:43,140 --> 01:15:46,090
 

3057
01:15:43,150 --> 01:15:49,030
 constraints on what the coefficients can

3058
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:49,030
 

3059
01:15:46,090 --> 01:15:51,550
 be and those strong implicit constraints

3060
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:51,550
 

3061
01:15:49,030 --> 01:15:52,960
 end up implying then strong things about

3062
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:52,960
 

3063
01:15:51,550 --> 01:15:54,610
 the permanent because that happens to be

3064
01:15:52,950 --> 01:15:54,610
 

3065
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:58,150
 just a coefficient in that stable

3066
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:58,150
 

3067
01:15:54,610 --> 01:16:00,100
 polynomial and in particular that's the

3068
01:15:58,140 --> 01:16:00,100
 

3069
01:15:58,150 --> 01:16:02,560
 kind of inequality he proved which as a

3070
01:16:00,090 --> 01:16:02,560
 

3071
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:04,480
 by-product solves the famous conjecture

3072
01:16:02,550 --> 01:16:04,480
 

3073
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:07,990
 but it basically then establishes a

3074
01:16:04,470 --> 01:16:07,990
 

3075
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:10,300
 machinery for analyzing several

3076
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:10,300
 

3077
01:16:07,990 --> 01:16:12,430
 difficult looking combinatorial objects

3078
01:16:10,290 --> 01:16:12,430
 

3079
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:15,850
 by coming up with a nice convex

3080
01:16:12,420 --> 01:16:15,850
 

3081
01:16:12,430 --> 01:16:17,500
 relaxation and this idea Bruce likes to

3082
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:17,500
 

3083
01:16:15,850 --> 01:16:20,980
 call the right-hand-side optimization

3084
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:20,980
 

3085
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:24,400
 problem the argument of the infimum as

3086
01:16:20,970 --> 01:16:24,400
 

3087
01:16:20,980 --> 01:16:28,480
 the capacity that has been used by many

3088
01:16:24,390 --> 01:16:28,480
 

3089
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:32,140
 people by now mostly in theoretical

3090
01:16:28,470 --> 01:16:32,140
 

3091
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:35,110
 computer science and it really

3092
01:16:32,130 --> 01:16:35,110
 

3093
01:16:32,140 --> 01:16:36,280
 intimately exploits the stability

3094
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:36,280
 

3095
01:16:35,110 --> 01:16:39,400
 property so this was just an

3096
01:16:36,270 --> 01:16:39,400
 

3097
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:42,070
 illustration of how these tools can help

3098
01:16:39,390 --> 01:16:42,070
 

3099
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:46,330
 you get a handle on some otherwise very

3100
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:46,330
 

3101
01:16:42,070 --> 01:16:48,130
 hard looking quantities I'll mention an

3102
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:48,130
 

3103
01:16:46,330 --> 01:16:52,690
 open problem for the interested people

3104
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:52,690
 

3105
01:16:48,130 --> 01:16:55,660
 in the room permanents count perfect

3106
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:55,660
 

3107
01:16:52,690 --> 01:16:57,310
 matchings in bipartite graphs if you

3108
01:16:55,650 --> 01:16:57,310
 

3109
01:16:55,660 --> 01:17:01,660
 want it to count the number of perfect

3110
01:16:57,300 --> 01:17:01,660
 

3111
01:16:57,310 --> 01:17:03,340
 matchings in a general graph nobody yet

3112
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:03,340
 

3113
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:06,040
 knows how to use this machinery

3114
01:17:03,330 --> 01:17:06,040
 

3115
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:08,080
 correctly for that because in particular

3116
01:17:06,030 --> 01:17:08,080
 

3117
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:10,540
 you can't apply the stable polynomial

3118
01:17:08,070 --> 01:17:10,540
 

3119
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:11,890
 machinery any more but still you can do

3120
01:17:10,530 --> 01:17:11,890
 

3121
01:17:10,540 --> 01:17:13,420
 some kind of interesting convex

3122
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:13,420
 

3123
01:17:11,890 --> 01:17:15,940
 relaxation nobody yet knows how to

3124
01:17:13,410 --> 01:17:15,940
 

3125
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:19,000
 analyze that so in case you care about

3126
01:17:15,930 --> 01:17:19,000
 

3127
01:17:15,940 --> 01:17:20,650
 that just an aside I may throw in some

3128
01:17:18,990 --> 01:17:20,650
 

3129
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:23,050
 other such a sides if

3130
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:23,050
 

3131
01:17:20,650 --> 01:17:25,180
 I have time okay that was just a flyby

3132
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:25,180
 

3133
01:17:23,050 --> 01:17:27,190
 let's do another flyby before I talk

3134
01:17:25,170 --> 01:17:27,190
 

3135
01:17:25,180 --> 01:17:29,440
 about some other concrete applications

3136
01:17:27,180 --> 01:17:29,440
 

3137
01:17:27,190 --> 01:17:34,540
 because I want to kind of speak to

3138
01:17:29,430 --> 01:17:34,540
 

3139
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:35,980
 everybody here so to ask that all of us

3140
01:17:34,530 --> 01:17:35,980
 

3141
01:17:34,540 --> 01:17:40,630
 in machine learning care about is

3142
01:17:35,970 --> 01:17:40,630
 

3143
01:17:35,980 --> 01:17:43,510
 learning stuff from data right and so

3144
01:17:40,620 --> 01:17:43,510
 

3145
01:17:40,630 --> 01:17:47,260
 the version with which we started a few

3146
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:47,260
 

3147
01:17:43,510 --> 01:17:49,150
 years ago is okay fine this DPP is this

3148
01:17:47,250 --> 01:17:49,150
 

3149
01:17:47,260 --> 01:17:51,940
 probability measure is parameterize by

3150
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:51,940
 

3151
01:17:49,150 --> 01:17:55,180
 that kernel matrix L where does it come

3152
01:17:51,930 --> 01:17:55,180
 

3153
01:17:51,940 --> 01:17:58,150
 from this is the age-old problem right

3154
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:58,150
 

3155
01:17:55,180 --> 01:18:00,490
 so then of course in machine learning

3156
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:00,490
 

3157
01:17:58,150 --> 01:18:01,750
 that's the standard answer we have if

3158
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:01,750
 

3159
01:18:00,490 --> 01:18:05,370
 you don't have something that you need

3160
01:18:01,740 --> 01:18:05,370
 

3161
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:07,900
 learn it so you learn it from data a

3162
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:07,900
 

3163
01:18:05,370 --> 01:18:10,900
 broader question this is again as kind

3164
01:18:07,890 --> 01:18:10,900
 

3165
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:13,420
 of a side to keep in mind is to think

3166
01:18:10,890 --> 01:18:13,420
 

3167
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:16,660
 about how might we go about formulating

3168
01:18:13,410 --> 01:18:16,660
 

3169
01:18:13,420 --> 01:18:19,660
 the task of learning these other sr

3170
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:19,660
 

3171
01:18:16,660 --> 01:18:22,090
 measures they work to general maybe you

3172
01:18:19,650 --> 01:18:22,090
 

3173
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:25,480
 can discover some nice parameters class

3174
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:25,480
 

3175
01:18:22,090 --> 01:18:27,610
 and learn that but any of all of that

3176
01:18:25,470 --> 01:18:27,610
 

3177
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:29,740
 has to be motivated by the right

3178
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:29,740
 

3179
01:18:27,610 --> 01:18:30,880
 application but if you're also curious

3180
01:18:29,730 --> 01:18:30,880
 

3181
01:18:29,740 --> 01:18:35,170
 mathematically you can do that

3182
01:18:30,870 --> 01:18:35,170
 

3183
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:37,180
 nevertheless so of course our

3184
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:37,180
 

3185
01:18:35,170 --> 01:18:38,860
 application was once we learned this

3186
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:38,860
 

3187
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:40,900
 parameter is model then we can sample

3188
01:18:38,850 --> 01:18:40,900
 

3189
01:18:38,860 --> 01:18:43,150
 according to it and then use those

3190
01:18:40,890 --> 01:18:43,150
 

3191
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:44,800
 samples in a subset selection problem or

3192
01:18:43,140 --> 01:18:44,800
 

3193
01:18:43,150 --> 01:18:48,640
 in a recommender system or something so

3194
01:18:44,790 --> 01:18:48,640
 

3195
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:50,680
 I'll come back to that and in fact this

3196
01:18:48,630 --> 01:18:50,680
 

3197
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:55,020
 type of learning was motivated and

3198
01:18:50,670 --> 01:18:55,020
 

3199
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:57,820
 studied by felicitous curve back in 2011

3200
01:18:55,010 --> 01:18:57,820
 

3201
01:18:55,020 --> 01:19:00,460
 then later others have also studied it

3202
01:18:57,810 --> 01:19:00,460
 

3203
01:18:57,820 --> 01:19:05,640
 and published in this conference or in

3204
01:19:00,450 --> 01:19:05,640
 

3205
01:19:00,460 --> 01:19:08,020
 ICML setting up a variety of different

3206
01:19:05,630 --> 01:19:08,020
 

3207
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:10,270
 formulations of the learning task as an

3208
01:19:08,010 --> 01:19:10,270
 

3209
01:19:08,020 --> 01:19:13,840
 optimization problem I will set up the

3210
01:19:10,260 --> 01:19:13,840
 

3211
01:19:10,270 --> 01:19:17,610
 simplest such formulation so here is a

3212
01:19:13,830 --> 01:19:17,610
 

3213
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:21,780
 simple formulation for you I observe

3214
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:21,780
 

3215
01:19:17,610 --> 01:19:26,320
 somehow or the other in different

3216
01:19:21,770 --> 01:19:26,320
 

3217
01:19:21,780 --> 01:19:28,460
 subsets capital n for ground set of n

3218
01:19:26,310 --> 01:19:28,460
 

3219
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:32,240
 items little n sorry

3220
01:19:28,450 --> 01:19:32,240
 

3221
01:19:28,460 --> 01:19:34,100
 and ends in there and I just want to get

3222
01:19:32,230 --> 01:19:34,100
 

3223
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:36,070
 a maximum like I just set up some kind

3224
01:19:34,090 --> 01:19:36,070
 

3225
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:39,500
 of maximum likelihood estimation problem

3226
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:39,500
 

3227
01:19:36,070 --> 01:19:42,200
 so I just want to learn parameters which

3228
01:19:39,490 --> 01:19:42,200
 

3229
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:43,760
 I kind of maximize this log of some of

3230
01:19:42,190 --> 01:19:43,760
 

3231
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:46,190
 the log of the probabilities of having

3232
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:46,190
 

3233
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:48,230
 observed assuming that these

3234
01:19:46,180 --> 01:19:48,230
 

3235
01:19:46,190 --> 01:19:51,770
 observations of were indeed coming from

3236
01:19:48,220 --> 01:19:51,770
 

3237
01:19:48,230 --> 01:19:53,000
 DP P even if they don't you can still

3238
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:53,000
 

3239
01:19:51,770 --> 01:19:54,920
 solve this problem right nobody's

3240
01:19:52,990 --> 01:19:54,920
 

3241
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,810
 stopping you so that's what the

3242
01:19:54,910 --> 01:19:56,810
 

3243
01:19:54,920 --> 01:20:00,860
 optimization problem looks like that

3244
01:19:56,800 --> 01:20:00,860
 

3245
01:19:56,810 --> 01:20:04,730
 optimization problem is non convex maybe

3246
01:20:00,850 --> 01:20:04,730
 

3247
01:20:00,860 --> 01:20:07,220
 it's I think it's hard to solve but it

3248
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:07,220
 

3249
01:20:04,730 --> 01:20:09,500
 has been studied in greater detail and

3250
01:20:07,210 --> 01:20:09,500
 

3251
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:11,690
 so much more is understood it by about

3252
01:20:09,490 --> 01:20:11,690
 

3253
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:17,150
 it by now and mention those references

3254
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:17,150
 

3255
01:20:11,690 --> 01:20:21,140
 so so here is a simple looking

3256
01:20:17,140 --> 01:20:21,140
 

3257
01:20:17,150 --> 01:20:26,450
 optimization problem one way to solve it

3258
01:20:21,130 --> 01:20:26,450
 

3259
01:20:21,140 --> 01:20:29,930
 is by this amazingly simple algorithm

3260
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:29,930
 

3261
01:20:26,450 --> 01:20:32,720
 discovered by my students l de ma here a

3262
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:32,720
 

3263
01:20:29,930 --> 01:20:36,740
 few years ago here is this amazingly

3264
01:20:32,710 --> 01:20:36,740
 

3265
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:42,200
 simple algorithm so you start with some

3266
01:20:36,730 --> 01:20:42,200
 

3267
01:20:36,740 --> 01:20:45,980
 L run this iteration then you scratch

3268
01:20:42,190 --> 01:20:45,980
 

3269
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:47,480
 your hand of course you just don't

3270
01:20:45,970 --> 01:20:47,480
 

3271
01:20:45,980 --> 01:20:49,310
 discover it like that but I can present

3272
01:20:47,470 --> 01:20:49,310
 

3273
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:52,070
 it like that right then you scratch you

3274
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:52,070
 

3275
01:20:49,310 --> 01:20:55,250
 had to see does this actually lead to a

3276
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:55,250
 

3277
01:20:52,070 --> 01:20:58,430
 solution it's actually a very

3278
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:58,430
 

3279
01:20:55,250 --> 01:21:01,670
 interesting task to try to verify that

3280
01:20:58,420 --> 01:21:01,670
 

3281
01:20:58,430 --> 01:21:03,670
 this simple iteration is implementable

3282
01:21:01,660 --> 01:21:03,670
 

3283
01:21:01,670 --> 01:21:08,620
 as you can see in two lines of MATLAB

3284
01:21:03,660 --> 01:21:08,620
 

3285
01:21:03,670 --> 01:21:14,110
 actually works it's a pretty decent and

3286
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:14,110
 

3287
01:21:08,620 --> 01:21:14,110
 force moving locally for solving that

3288
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:15,150
 

3289
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:22,850
 and in fact to this date we don't know

3290
01:21:19,110 --> 01:21:22,850
 

3291
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:25,100
 if the second term so this looks like

3292
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:25,100
 

3293
01:21:22,850 --> 01:21:27,500
 some kind of fancified gradient ascent

3294
01:21:25,090 --> 01:21:27,500
 

3295
01:21:25,100 --> 01:21:31,060
 method if the second term you replace

3296
01:21:27,490 --> 01:21:31,060
 

3297
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:33,500
 you add a step size in there

3298
01:21:31,050 --> 01:21:33,500
 

3299
01:21:31,060 --> 01:21:37,460
 it still works but we don't know how to

3300
01:21:33,490 --> 01:21:37,460
 

3301
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:40,550
 prove that but any other set aside there

3302
01:21:37,450 --> 01:21:40,550
 

3303
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:41,749
 is recent work on just the MLE problem

3304
01:21:40,540 --> 01:21:41,749
 

3305
01:21:40,550 --> 01:21:43,309
 so for studying

3306
01:21:41,739 --> 01:21:43,309
 

3307
01:21:41,749 --> 01:21:46,159
 sent otic properties of Emily's for

3308
01:21:43,299 --> 01:21:46,159
 

3309
01:21:43,309 --> 01:21:47,749
 DPP's it's done by those authors I think

3310
01:21:46,149 --> 01:21:47,749
 

3311
01:21:46,159 --> 01:21:51,769
 Victor might be in the ordinance item F

3312
01:21:47,739 --> 01:21:51,769
 

3313
01:21:47,749 --> 01:21:54,109
 is here and learning a DPP by a methods

3314
01:21:51,759 --> 01:21:54,109
 

3315
01:21:51,769 --> 01:21:56,569
 of moments again to optimize sample

3316
01:21:54,099 --> 01:21:56,569
 

3317
01:21:54,109 --> 01:21:59,959
 complexity that's also studied has been

3318
01:21:56,559 --> 01:21:59,959
 

3319
01:21:56,569 --> 01:22:01,459
 studied recently so there's quite a bit

3320
01:21:59,949 --> 01:22:01,459
 

3321
01:21:59,959 --> 01:22:03,439
 of interesting theory that has been

3322
01:22:01,449 --> 01:22:03,439
 

3323
01:22:01,459 --> 01:22:07,039
 developed for the Emily problem though

3324
01:22:03,429 --> 01:22:07,039
 

3325
01:22:03,439 --> 01:22:12,709
 in the let's say statistical version of

3326
01:22:07,029 --> 01:22:12,709
 

3327
01:22:07,039 --> 01:22:14,419
 it so when you look at this many of the

3328
01:22:12,699 --> 01:22:14,419
 

3329
01:22:12,709 --> 01:22:16,489
 large scale people in the room may say

3330
01:22:14,409 --> 01:22:16,489
 

3331
01:22:14,419 --> 01:22:18,589
 well you have those matrices and you

3332
01:22:16,479 --> 01:22:18,589
 

3333
01:22:16,489 --> 01:22:21,459
 have these gradients of determinants

3334
01:22:18,579 --> 01:22:21,459
 

3335
01:22:18,589 --> 01:22:23,409
 those are not easy objects to compute

3336
01:22:21,449 --> 01:22:23,409
 

3337
01:22:21,459 --> 01:22:28,279
 what should I do

3338
01:22:23,399 --> 01:22:28,279
 

3339
01:22:23,409 --> 01:22:30,169
 so of course the basic iteration if you

3340
01:22:28,269 --> 01:22:30,169
 

3341
01:22:28,279 --> 01:22:34,219
 implement that cos n cube how do you get

3342
01:22:30,159 --> 01:22:34,219
 

3343
01:22:30,169 --> 01:22:40,579
 around that paper one paper to paper

3344
01:22:34,209 --> 01:22:40,579
 

3345
01:22:34,219 --> 01:22:42,609
 three I mean but you can also do it

3346
01:22:40,569 --> 01:22:42,609
 

3347
01:22:40,579 --> 01:22:45,859
 separately but what that means is you

3348
01:22:42,599 --> 01:22:45,859
 

3349
01:22:42,609 --> 01:22:48,499
 make some sacrifices to the model right

3350
01:22:45,849 --> 01:22:48,499
 

3351
01:22:45,859 --> 01:22:51,799
 and then you can scale up so one of

3352
01:22:48,489 --> 01:22:51,799
 

3353
01:22:48,499 --> 01:22:55,039
 those is the KD PP where you restrict to

3354
01:22:51,789 --> 01:22:55,039
 

3355
01:22:51,799 --> 01:22:59,839
 only sample subsets of size exactly k

3356
01:22:55,029 --> 01:22:59,839
 

3357
01:22:55,039 --> 01:23:02,209
 then the progress then the iteration can

3358
01:22:59,829 --> 01:23:02,209
 

3359
01:22:59,839 --> 01:23:03,889
 be sped up but not so not not this

3360
01:23:02,199 --> 01:23:03,889
 

3361
01:23:02,209 --> 01:23:05,479
 iteration but then the learning task can

3362
01:23:03,879 --> 01:23:05,479
 

3363
01:23:03,889 --> 01:23:08,689
 be simplified by looking for a smaller

3364
01:23:05,469 --> 01:23:08,689
 

3365
01:23:05,479 --> 01:23:10,729
 class of DPP's including a low-rank

3366
01:23:08,679 --> 01:23:10,729
 

3367
01:23:08,689 --> 01:23:14,299
 version like you can try out all these

3368
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:14,299
 

3369
01:23:10,729 --> 01:23:16,009
 ideas so either exactly k is the support

3370
01:23:14,289 --> 01:23:16,009
 

3371
01:23:14,299 --> 01:23:18,259
 or less than equal to case the support

3372
01:23:15,999 --> 01:23:18,259
 

3373
01:23:16,009 --> 01:23:20,749
 or there is another version you write n

3374
01:23:18,249 --> 01:23:20,749
 

3375
01:23:18,259 --> 01:23:22,249
 as a chronica product so it support can

3376
01:23:20,739 --> 01:23:22,249
 

3377
01:23:20,749 --> 01:23:24,139
 be of any size but because it's

3378
01:23:22,239 --> 01:23:24,139
 

3379
01:23:22,249 --> 01:23:28,579
 Kronecker product you can scale up

3380
01:23:24,129 --> 01:23:28,579
 

3381
01:23:24,139 --> 01:23:31,129
 amongst many other ideas but the point

3382
01:23:28,569 --> 01:23:31,129
 

3383
01:23:28,579 --> 01:23:33,679
 is learning task which has downstream

3384
01:23:31,119 --> 01:23:33,679
 

3385
01:23:31,129 --> 01:23:35,449
 applications becomes interesting enough

3386
01:23:33,669 --> 01:23:35,449
 

3387
01:23:33,679 --> 01:23:39,979
 to discover a variety of different

3388
01:23:35,439 --> 01:23:39,979
 

3389
01:23:35,449 --> 01:23:41,659
 techniques to scale it up and I am a

3390
01:23:39,969 --> 01:23:41,659
 

3391
01:23:39,979 --> 01:23:44,269
 comment on this later but I think

3392
01:23:41,649 --> 01:23:44,269
 

3393
01:23:41,659 --> 01:23:45,189
 recently people have also started trying

3394
01:23:44,259 --> 01:23:45,189
 

3395
01:23:44,269 --> 01:23:49,479
 to

3396
01:23:45,179 --> 01:23:49,479
 

3397
01:23:45,189 --> 01:23:50,979
 learn this kernel matrices by embedding

3398
01:23:49,469 --> 01:23:50,979
 

3399
01:23:49,479 --> 01:23:56,199
 them within some nonlinear feature

3400
01:23:50,969 --> 01:23:56,199
 

3401
01:23:50,979 --> 01:23:59,800
 learning framework okay so some open

3402
01:23:56,189 --> 01:23:59,800
 

3403
01:23:56,199 --> 01:24:02,439
 problems for you just broad problems

3404
01:23:59,790 --> 01:24:02,439
 

3405
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:03,789
 okay it's not specified super sharply so

3406
01:24:02,429 --> 01:24:03,789
 

3407
01:24:02,439 --> 01:24:05,439
 one problem is just learning

3408
01:24:03,779 --> 01:24:05,439
 

3409
01:24:03,789 --> 01:24:09,129
 parameterized classes of other s or

3410
01:24:05,429 --> 01:24:09,129
 

3411
01:24:05,439 --> 01:24:13,599
 measures of interest efficiently

3412
01:24:09,119 --> 01:24:13,599
 

3413
01:24:09,129 --> 01:24:15,129
 learning this exponentiated or sharper

3414
01:24:13,589 --> 01:24:15,129
 

3415
01:24:13,599 --> 01:24:16,869
 version of power DP P so it has

3416
01:24:15,119 --> 01:24:16,869
 

3417
01:24:15,129 --> 01:24:18,969
 algebraically it still has determinants

3418
01:24:16,859 --> 01:24:18,969
 

3419
01:24:16,869 --> 01:24:21,419
 but now it has a power the reason it's

3420
01:24:18,959 --> 01:24:21,419
 

3421
01:24:18,969 --> 01:24:24,639
 hard is we cannot we can no longer

3422
01:24:21,409 --> 01:24:24,639
 

3423
01:24:21,419 --> 01:24:26,469
 easily compute its partition function we

3424
01:24:24,629 --> 01:24:26,469
 

3425
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:28,149
 can approximate it but not easily

3426
01:24:26,459 --> 01:24:28,149
 

3427
01:24:26,469 --> 01:24:32,260
 computed so the learning task becomes

3428
01:24:28,139 --> 01:24:32,260
 

3429
01:24:28,149 --> 01:24:34,479
 more challenging or just learning that

3430
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:34,479
 

3431
01:24:32,260 --> 01:24:36,249
 temperature parameter to have just a

3432
01:24:34,469 --> 01:24:36,249
 

3433
01:24:34,479 --> 01:24:38,349
 single scalar to interpolate between

3434
01:24:36,239 --> 01:24:38,349
 

3435
01:24:36,249 --> 01:24:40,809
 uniform sampling and sharper and sharper

3436
01:24:38,339 --> 01:24:40,809
 

3437
01:24:38,349 --> 01:24:45,579
 until as P goes to infinity you come to

3438
01:24:40,799 --> 01:24:45,579
 

3439
01:24:40,809 --> 01:24:47,469
 the mode of the distribution and so on

3440
01:24:45,569 --> 01:24:47,469
 

3441
01:24:45,579 --> 01:24:49,929
 so there's a variety of open problems

3442
01:24:47,459 --> 01:24:49,929
 

3443
01:24:47,469 --> 01:24:51,699
 worth studying further including you

3444
01:24:49,919 --> 01:24:51,699
 

3445
01:24:49,929 --> 01:24:53,169
 don't have to just go by the MLE route

3446
01:24:51,689 --> 01:24:53,169
 

3447
01:24:51,699 --> 01:25:02,889
 you can come up with some other learning

3448
01:24:53,159 --> 01:25:02,889
 

3449
01:24:53,169 --> 01:25:07,149
 framework including like against okay so

3450
01:25:02,879 --> 01:25:07,149
 

3451
01:25:02,889 --> 01:25:09,699
 that was flyby Theory plus algorithm now

3452
01:25:07,139 --> 01:25:09,699
 

3453
01:25:07,149 --> 01:25:11,320
 let me just in the remaining time before

3454
01:25:09,689 --> 01:25:11,320
 

3455
01:25:09,699 --> 01:25:15,309
 I have to wrap up to tell you some of

3456
01:25:11,310 --> 01:25:15,309
 

3457
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:17,109
 the perspectives try to quickly go

3458
01:25:15,299 --> 01:25:17,109
 

3459
01:25:15,309 --> 01:25:24,550
 through as many of these applications as

3460
01:25:17,099 --> 01:25:24,550
 

3461
01:25:17,109 --> 01:25:27,550
 possible so and what we'll do is I think

3462
01:25:24,540 --> 01:25:27,550
 

3463
01:25:24,550 --> 01:25:30,699
 to kind of streamline the rest of the

3464
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:30,699
 

3465
01:25:27,550 --> 01:25:33,579
 speech after I'm done speaking then I

3466
01:25:30,689 --> 01:25:33,579
 

3467
01:25:30,699 --> 01:25:38,139
 can handle questions right now maybe I

3468
01:25:33,569 --> 01:25:38,139
 

3469
01:25:33,579 --> 01:25:41,199
 can just go like a train okay so the

3470
01:25:38,129 --> 01:25:41,199
 

3471
01:25:38,139 --> 01:25:43,269
 first one actually I learned of this

3472
01:25:41,189 --> 01:25:43,269
 

3473
01:25:41,199 --> 01:25:46,610
 recently even though this has been

3474
01:25:43,259 --> 01:25:46,610
 

3475
01:25:43,269 --> 01:25:49,400
 classically the common

3476
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:49,400
 

3477
01:25:46,610 --> 01:25:52,280
 application for diverse sampling the

3478
01:25:49,390 --> 01:25:52,280
 

3479
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:53,870
 idea of recommending a diverse subset

3480
01:25:52,270 --> 01:25:53,870
 

3481
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:56,870
 within a recommender system kind of

3482
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:56,870
 

3483
01:25:53,870 --> 01:25:58,310
 diversity was recognized on 2001 in

3484
01:25:56,860 --> 01:25:58,310
 

3485
01:25:56,870 --> 01:26:06,350
 recommender systems in machine learning

3486
01:25:58,300 --> 01:26:06,350
 

3487
01:25:58,310 --> 01:26:08,030
 it's more recent and it's a big topic in

3488
01:26:06,340 --> 01:26:08,030
 

3489
01:26:06,350 --> 01:26:10,180
 recommender systems to diversify the

3490
01:26:08,020 --> 01:26:10,180
 

3491
01:26:08,030 --> 01:26:12,590
 basket of stuff shown to users right

3492
01:26:10,170 --> 01:26:12,590
 

3493
01:26:10,180 --> 01:26:14,150
 Twitter still doesn't do a good job it

3494
01:26:12,580 --> 01:26:14,150
 

3495
01:26:12,590 --> 01:26:17,480
 shows me the traits from the same person

3496
01:26:14,140 --> 01:26:17,480
 

3497
01:26:14,150 --> 01:26:19,940
 ten times come on so they need to do

3498
01:26:17,470 --> 01:26:19,940
 

3499
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:22,100
 this so recommender system however

3500
01:26:19,930 --> 01:26:22,100
 

3501
01:26:19,940 --> 01:26:23,960
 there's a bunch of challenges you know

3502
01:26:22,090 --> 01:26:23,960
 

3503
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:28,070
 like you want to recommend you can see I

3504
01:26:23,950 --> 01:26:28,070
 

3505
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:30,080
 just picked up some channel for babies

3506
01:26:28,060 --> 01:26:30,080
 

3507
01:26:28,070 --> 01:26:32,300
 and children's songs or something I

3508
01:26:30,070 --> 01:26:32,300
 

3509
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:33,920
 don't know if you look at the subtitle

3510
01:26:32,290 --> 01:26:33,920
 

3511
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:35,300
 doesn't look like that diverse even

3512
01:26:33,910 --> 01:26:35,300
 

3513
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:37,670
 though the pictures look quite diverse

3514
01:26:35,290 --> 01:26:37,670
 

3515
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:39,350
 you can already see depending on what

3516
01:26:37,660 --> 01:26:39,350
 

3517
01:26:37,670 --> 01:26:41,390
 features you are using for your kernels

3518
01:26:39,340 --> 01:26:41,390
 

3519
01:26:39,350 --> 01:26:43,970
 notion of diversity starts with a

3520
01:26:41,380 --> 01:26:43,970
 

3521
01:26:41,390 --> 01:26:46,640
 completely Dell quite challenging to

3522
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:46,640
 

3523
01:26:43,970 --> 01:26:49,010
 engineer right so anyhow so there is a

3524
01:26:46,630 --> 01:26:49,010
 

3525
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:52,670
 very interesting work coming out

3526
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:52,670
 

3527
01:26:49,010 --> 01:26:55,430
 actually pretty recently is how to

3528
01:26:52,660 --> 01:26:55,430
 

3529
01:26:52,670 --> 01:26:58,160
 handle diversified recommendations in

3530
01:26:55,420 --> 01:26:58,160
 

3531
01:26:55,430 --> 01:27:01,580
 real life so this is coming from people

3532
01:26:58,150 --> 01:27:01,580
 

3533
01:26:58,160 --> 01:27:08,420
 some people at Google to try to use a

3534
01:27:01,570 --> 01:27:08,420
 

3535
01:27:01,580 --> 01:27:11,660
 DPP to essentially more fine-tune the

3536
01:27:08,410 --> 01:27:11,660
 

3537
01:27:08,420 --> 01:27:14,720
 feed or interesting videos to watch that

3538
01:27:11,650 --> 01:27:14,720
 

3539
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:18,050
 YouTube could show you and this

3540
01:27:14,710 --> 01:27:18,050
 

3541
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:21,730
 application raises the motivation of

3542
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:21,730
 

3543
01:27:18,050 --> 01:27:24,320
 this paper exposes the user to sort of

3544
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:24,320
 

3545
01:27:21,730 --> 01:27:26,150
 very cool challenges that arise when

3546
01:27:24,310 --> 01:27:26,150
 

3547
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:29,900
 trying to do diversity in a real life

3548
01:27:26,140 --> 01:27:29,900
 

3549
01:27:26,150 --> 01:27:32,570
 production type environment for in for

3550
01:27:29,890 --> 01:27:32,570
 

3551
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:33,770
 instance we never talk about this but

3552
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:33,770
 

3553
01:27:32,570 --> 01:27:35,150
 the moment you try to do a real

3554
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:35,150
 

3555
01:27:33,770 --> 01:27:37,640
 application this is the first place

3556
01:27:35,140 --> 01:27:37,640
 

3557
01:27:35,150 --> 01:27:39,920
 things fail right the models notion of

3558
01:27:37,630 --> 01:27:39,920
 

3559
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:42,050
 diversity may or may not have anything

3560
01:27:39,910 --> 01:27:42,050
 

3561
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:43,340
 to do with a user solution of diversity

3562
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:43,340
 

3563
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:45,140
 and different users may have different

3564
01:27:43,330 --> 01:27:45,140
 

3565
01:27:43,340 --> 01:27:47,990
 notions of diversity what are you gonna

3566
01:27:45,130 --> 01:27:47,990
 

3567
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:49,670
 do tough problem right so any all those

3568
01:27:47,980 --> 01:27:49,670
 

3569
01:27:47,990 --> 01:27:51,500
 problems do raise new questions on how

3570
01:27:49,660 --> 01:27:51,500
 

3571
01:27:49,670 --> 01:27:53,870
 to do negative dependence but never the

3572
01:27:51,490 --> 01:27:53,870
 

3573
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:56,180
 less valuable to identify them how to

3574
01:27:53,860 --> 01:27:56,180
 

3575
01:27:53,870 --> 01:27:57,000
 scale this to large-scale data fine is

3576
01:27:56,170 --> 01:27:57,000
 

3577
01:27:56,180 --> 01:27:59,490
 Google me

3578
01:27:56,990 --> 01:27:59,490
 

3579
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:01,080
 zillions of computers not but when we

3580
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:01,080
 

3581
01:27:59,490 --> 01:28:03,900
 are experimenting we may not have those

3582
01:28:01,070 --> 01:28:03,900
 

3583
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:05,730
 computers so it's an even they may need

3584
01:28:03,890 --> 01:28:05,730
 

3585
01:28:03,900 --> 01:28:09,120
 those computers because data comes in

3586
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:09,120
 

3587
01:28:05,730 --> 01:28:12,180
 every day how to scale a more

3588
01:28:09,110 --> 01:28:12,180
 

3589
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:14,310
 interesting challenge which makes it

3590
01:28:12,170 --> 01:28:14,310
 

3591
01:28:12,180 --> 01:28:16,740
 sometimes harder to adopt more

3592
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:16,740
 

3593
01:28:14,310 --> 01:28:18,450
 sophisticated models is how do you

3594
01:28:16,730 --> 01:28:18,450
 

3595
01:28:16,740 --> 01:28:20,160
 integrate this more powerful

3596
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:20,160
 

3597
01:28:18,450 --> 01:28:23,400
 sophisticated model in an existing

3598
01:28:20,150 --> 01:28:23,400
 

3599
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:26,550
 ecosystem they have a full engineering

3600
01:28:23,390 --> 01:28:26,550
 

3601
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:28,200
 stack the gazillions of features are

3602
01:28:26,540 --> 01:28:28,200
 

3603
01:28:26,550 --> 01:28:29,540
 coming in being engineered clean and

3604
01:28:28,190 --> 01:28:29,540
 

3605
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:32,220
 generated what not

3606
01:28:29,530 --> 01:28:32,220
 

3607
01:28:29,540 --> 01:28:34,260
 finally some recommend something is

3608
01:28:32,210 --> 01:28:34,260
 

3609
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:36,600
 ready to be recommended so at which

3610
01:28:34,250 --> 01:28:36,600
 

3611
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:38,810
 stage can you plug in a negatively

3612
01:28:36,590 --> 01:28:38,810
 

3613
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:42,240
 dependent model to do diversification

3614
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:42,240
 

3615
01:28:38,810 --> 01:28:45,300
 that's in production level decision a

3616
01:28:42,230 --> 01:28:45,300
 

3617
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:47,160
 very crucial one so the way this paper

3618
01:28:45,290 --> 01:28:47,160
 

3619
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:49,140
 handled their decision is they say ok

3620
01:28:47,150 --> 01:28:49,140
 

3621
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:51,540
 let us learn the deep learning based

3622
01:28:49,130 --> 01:28:51,540
 

3623
01:28:49,140 --> 01:28:53,640
 features etc etc will use those

3624
01:28:51,530 --> 01:28:53,640
 

3625
01:28:51,540 --> 01:28:56,630
 nonlinear features and only in the end

3626
01:28:53,630 --> 01:28:56,630
 

3627
01:28:53,640 --> 01:29:00,000
 out of the hundred identified items

3628
01:28:56,620 --> 01:29:00,000
 

3629
01:28:56,630 --> 01:29:01,610
 rather than rank them point wise one by

3630
01:28:59,990 --> 01:29:01,610
 

3631
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:05,010
 one I show you this is the best ranked

3632
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:05,010
 

3633
01:29:01,610 --> 01:29:07,320
 video for your second best I'll select a

3634
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,320
 

3635
01:29:05,010 --> 01:29:09,300
 subset of diverse videos rather than

3636
01:29:07,310 --> 01:29:09,300
 

3637
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:11,010
 point wise I operate set wise and to go

3638
01:29:09,290 --> 01:29:11,010
 

3639
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:13,890
 from points to sets they use DPP's

3640
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,890
 

3641
01:29:11,010 --> 01:29:15,630
 that's kind of the summary but it's you

3642
01:29:13,880 --> 01:29:15,630
 

3643
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:17,400
 can see how much more work goes into

3644
01:29:15,620 --> 01:29:17,400
 

3645
01:29:15,630 --> 01:29:19,560
 translating something into reality but

3646
01:29:17,390 --> 01:29:19,560
 

3647
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:21,360
 it's really nice that they can do that

3648
01:29:19,550 --> 01:29:21,360
 

3649
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:24,690
 and it's a starting point there's many

3650
01:29:21,350 --> 01:29:24,690
 

3651
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:27,120
 other interesting applied plus

3652
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:27,120
 

3653
01:29:24,690 --> 01:29:30,290
 theoretical open problems that arise as

3654
01:29:27,110 --> 01:29:30,290
 

3655
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:30,290
 a consequence of this work

3656
01:29:35,220 --> 01:29:35,220
 

3657
01:29:35,230 --> 01:29:43,670
 okay so that was what let's do the flyby

3658
01:29:38,770 --> 01:29:43,670
 

3659
01:29:38,780 --> 01:29:46,190
 of the next application is this one is

3660
01:29:43,660 --> 01:29:46,190
 

3661
01:29:43,670 --> 01:29:48,470
 let's say more theoretical and

3662
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:48,470
 

3663
01:29:46,190 --> 01:29:49,670
 simultaneously practical application is

3664
01:29:48,460 --> 01:29:49,670
 

3665
01:29:48,470 --> 01:29:52,130
 the famous Nystrom

3666
01:29:49,660 --> 01:29:52,130
 

3667
01:29:49,670 --> 01:29:54,110
 approximation so many of you may have

3668
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:54,110
 

3669
01:29:52,130 --> 01:29:55,670
 heard something like I don't know random

3670
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:55,670
 

3671
01:29:54,110 --> 01:29:58,400
 kitchen sink random for your features

3672
01:29:55,660 --> 01:29:58,400
 

3673
01:29:55,670 --> 01:30:00,650
 Nystrom approximation so random features

3674
01:29:58,390 --> 01:30:00,650
 

3675
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:02,800
 say okay let's not look really at the

3676
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:02,800
 

3677
01:30:00,650 --> 01:30:04,910
 data and just do some random features

3678
01:30:02,790 --> 01:30:04,910
 

3679
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:06,770
 matrix approximation low rank matrix

3680
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:06,770
 

3681
01:30:04,910 --> 01:30:08,360
 approximation nice term approximation

3682
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:08,360
 

3683
01:30:06,770 --> 01:30:11,140
 these methods say let's actually look at

3684
01:30:08,350 --> 01:30:11,140
 

3685
01:30:08,360 --> 01:30:14,360
 the data and try to come up with a more

3686
01:30:11,130 --> 01:30:14,360
 

3687
01:30:11,140 --> 01:30:18,200
 data-driven approximation to a kernel

3688
01:30:14,350 --> 01:30:18,200
 

3689
01:30:14,360 --> 01:30:22,040
 matrix so if I have a kernel matrix it's

3690
01:30:18,190 --> 01:30:22,040
 

3691
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:23,780
 a big box of numbers I want to

3692
01:30:22,030 --> 01:30:23,780
 

3693
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:26,600
 approximate it with something that uses

3694
01:30:23,770 --> 01:30:26,600
 

3695
01:30:23,780 --> 01:30:28,850
 fewer parameters I don't want to have n

3696
01:30:26,590 --> 01:30:28,850
 

3697
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:30,920
 square in there for n data points and

3698
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:30,920
 

3699
01:30:28,850 --> 01:30:32,450
 have an N square kernel matrix n square

3700
01:30:30,910 --> 01:30:32,450
 

3701
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:34,100
 entries each entry take some time to

3702
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:34,100
 

3703
01:30:32,450 --> 01:30:35,030
 compute even approximate it with

3704
01:30:34,090 --> 01:30:35,030
 

3705
01:30:34,100 --> 01:30:36,890
 something smaller

3706
01:30:35,020 --> 01:30:36,890
 

3707
01:30:35,030 --> 01:30:38,380
 well low-rank approximation but what

3708
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:38,380
 

3709
01:30:36,890 --> 01:30:41,570
 illuminant approximation

3710
01:30:38,370 --> 01:30:41,570
 

3711
01:30:38,380 --> 01:30:44,450
 Stephani already hinted at this but

3712
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:44,450
 

3713
01:30:41,570 --> 01:30:46,280
 actually this particular task people in

3714
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:46,280
 

3715
01:30:44,450 --> 01:30:49,430
 our community have studied since a long

3716
01:30:46,270 --> 01:30:49,430
 

3717
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:51,590
 time so mr. om studied it I think in

3718
01:30:49,420 --> 01:30:51,590
 

3719
01:30:49,430 --> 01:30:53,990
 1930 in term in the when he was doing

3720
01:30:51,580 --> 01:30:53,990
 

3721
01:30:51,590 --> 01:30:56,240
 quadrature but it was taken up in

3722
01:30:53,980 --> 01:30:56,240
 

3723
01:30:53,990 --> 01:31:01,130
 machine learning earliest by this

3724
01:30:56,230 --> 01:31:01,130
 

3725
01:30:56,240 --> 01:31:03,170
 Williams and Zeta paper from 2001 their

3726
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:03,170
 

3727
01:31:01,130 --> 01:31:05,270
 motivation that time was to scale a

3728
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:05,270
 

3729
01:31:03,170 --> 01:31:08,840
 Gaussian process regression and

3730
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:08,840
 

3731
01:31:05,270 --> 01:31:12,410
 inference with GPS another consumer of

3732
01:31:08,830 --> 01:31:12,410
 

3733
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:19,190
 kernels and there's been a variety of

3734
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:19,190
 

3735
01:31:12,410 --> 01:31:22,220
 ideas on how to sub sample data to come

3736
01:31:19,180 --> 01:31:22,220
 

3737
01:31:19,190 --> 01:31:26,090
 up with a good approximation to the

3738
01:31:22,210 --> 01:31:26,090
 

3739
01:31:22,220 --> 01:31:29,000
 kernel matrix and the fact that I'm

3740
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:29,000
 

3741
01:31:26,090 --> 01:31:31,460
 talking about this you can guess I'm

3742
01:31:28,990 --> 01:31:31,460
 

3743
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:33,020
 trying to pick columns it's a symmetric

3744
01:31:31,450 --> 01:31:33,020
 

3745
01:31:31,460 --> 01:31:34,370
 matrix so you pick rows column same

3746
01:31:33,010 --> 01:31:34,370
 

3747
01:31:33,020 --> 01:31:36,790
 thing right so I'm trying to pick

3748
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:36,790
 

3749
01:31:34,370 --> 01:31:40,099
 columns of this matrix to come up with

3750
01:31:36,780 --> 01:31:40,099
 

3751
01:31:36,790 --> 01:31:43,309
 some kind of low-rank approximation

3752
01:31:40,089 --> 01:31:43,309
 

3753
01:31:40,099 --> 01:31:46,070
 and by the theory of talks because I'm

3754
01:31:43,299 --> 01:31:46,070
 

3755
01:31:43,309 --> 01:31:53,150
 talking about it clearly these columns

3756
01:31:46,060 --> 01:31:53,150
 

3757
01:31:46,070 --> 01:31:54,679
 will be picked according to some so in

3758
01:31:53,140 --> 01:31:54,679
 

3759
01:31:53,150 --> 01:31:59,539
 fact what I'll do is I will pick a

3760
01:31:54,669 --> 01:31:59,539
 

3761
01:31:54,679 --> 01:32:01,909
 subset of columns according to a KD P P

3762
01:31:59,529 --> 01:32:01,909
 

3763
01:31:59,539 --> 01:32:03,500
 I should have called it a CDP because I

3764
01:32:01,899 --> 01:32:03,500
 

3765
01:32:01,909 --> 01:32:05,750
 want to pick see columns bigger than

3766
01:32:03,490 --> 01:32:05,750
 

3767
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:09,670
 equal to K but whatever and I'll

3768
01:32:05,740 --> 01:32:09,670
 

3769
01:32:05,750 --> 01:32:09,670
 construct this approximation K hat

3770
01:32:10,799 --> 01:32:10,799
 

3771
01:32:10,809 --> 01:32:22,389
 MATLAB notation sorry to the Python

3772
01:32:15,009 --> 01:32:22,389
 

3773
01:32:15,019 --> 01:32:25,789
 folks so fine but interestingly you can

3774
01:32:22,379 --> 01:32:25,789
 

3775
01:32:22,389 --> 01:32:28,789
 subsample according to that dependent

3776
01:32:25,779 --> 01:32:28,789
 

3777
01:32:25,789 --> 01:32:33,260
 probability measure and you can prove

3778
01:32:28,779 --> 01:32:33,260
 

3779
01:32:28,789 --> 01:32:35,690
 that it's not too far from the best rank

3780
01:32:33,250 --> 01:32:35,690
 

3781
01:32:33,260 --> 01:32:39,139
 approximation which actually SVD or

3782
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:39,139
 

3783
01:32:35,690 --> 01:32:41,510
 eigenvectors would give you and it has

3784
01:32:39,129 --> 01:32:41,510
 

3785
01:32:39,139 --> 01:32:43,159
 some further downstream implications on

3786
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:43,159
 

3787
01:32:41,510 --> 01:32:44,599
 regression that if you were to instead

3788
01:32:43,149 --> 01:32:44,599
 

3789
01:32:43,159 --> 01:32:46,880
 of using if you were doing kernel

3790
01:32:44,589 --> 01:32:46,880
 

3791
01:32:44,599 --> 01:32:52,300
 regression instead of using K you would

3792
01:32:46,870 --> 01:32:52,300
 

3793
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:54,739
 use K hat how the expected risk behaves

3794
01:32:52,290 --> 01:32:54,739
 

3795
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:58,010
 so it's pretty interesting that one can

3796
01:32:54,729 --> 01:32:58,010
 

3797
01:32:54,739 --> 01:33:02,719
 prove something like this because these

3798
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:02,719
 

3799
01:32:58,010 --> 01:33:04,849
 are non iid samples and of course I

3800
01:33:02,709 --> 01:33:04,849
 

3801
01:33:02,719 --> 01:33:07,369
 wouldn't share this with you here but

3802
01:33:04,839 --> 01:33:07,369
 

3803
01:33:04,849 --> 01:33:09,170
 unless these things actually also work

3804
01:33:07,359 --> 01:33:09,170
 

3805
01:33:07,369 --> 01:33:12,889
 in practice because remember we are

3806
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:12,889
 

3807
01:33:09,170 --> 01:33:16,099
 talking about applications so in fact if

3808
01:33:12,879 --> 01:33:16,099
 

3809
01:33:12,889 --> 01:33:18,739
 you try to have this dual access scatter

3810
01:33:16,089 --> 01:33:18,739
 

3811
01:33:16,099 --> 01:33:21,380
 plot x axis is the time it takes to

3812
01:33:18,729 --> 01:33:21,380
 

3813
01:33:18,739 --> 01:33:23,840
 generate the approximation why is XS

3814
01:33:21,370 --> 01:33:23,840
 

3815
01:33:21,380 --> 01:33:26,119
 gives the quality of approximation how

3816
01:33:23,830 --> 01:33:26,119
 

3817
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:28,039
 much is the error then clearly want to

3818
01:33:26,109 --> 01:33:28,039
 

3819
01:33:26,119 --> 01:33:29,630
 be closer to the origin there's a

3820
01:33:28,029 --> 01:33:29,630
 

3821
01:33:28,039 --> 01:33:35,030
 variety of choices based on either

3822
01:33:29,620 --> 01:33:35,030
 

3823
01:33:29,630 --> 01:33:37,489
 cluster the data k-means or do some

3824
01:33:35,020 --> 01:33:37,489
 

3825
01:33:35,030 --> 01:33:40,780
 leverage scores or adaptive leverage

3826
01:33:37,479 --> 01:33:40,780
 

3827
01:33:37,489 --> 01:33:43,099
 scores or so on and when engineered

3828
01:33:40,770 --> 01:33:43,099
 

3829
01:33:40,780 --> 01:33:45,920
 correctly which means if you implement

3830
01:33:43,089 --> 01:33:45,920
 

3831
01:33:43,099 --> 01:33:47,190
 the sampler nicely then a DPP based

3832
01:33:45,910 --> 01:33:47,190
 

3833
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:48,510
 approximation

3834
01:33:47,180 --> 01:33:48,510
 

3835
01:33:47,190 --> 01:33:50,630
 is kind of getting the best of both

3836
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:50,630
 

3837
01:33:48,510 --> 01:33:53,400
 world so there's running code for this

3838
01:33:50,620 --> 01:33:53,400
 

3839
01:33:50,630 --> 01:33:55,520
 so this is a reasonable approach which

3840
01:33:53,390 --> 01:33:55,520
 

3841
01:33:53,400 --> 01:34:06,120
 of course can be further improved but

3842
01:33:55,510 --> 01:34:06,120
 

3843
01:33:55,520 --> 01:34:09,150
 let me not go there this was a this is

3844
01:34:06,110 --> 01:34:09,150
 

3845
01:34:06,120 --> 01:34:10,980
 was an interesting application this is

3846
01:34:09,140 --> 01:34:10,980
 

3847
01:34:09,150 --> 01:34:12,810
 the starting point to get people

3848
01:34:10,970 --> 01:34:12,810
 

3849
01:34:10,980 --> 01:34:16,500
 thinking in this direction okay this is

3850
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:16,500
 

3851
01:34:12,810 --> 01:34:19,350
 just a proof-of-concept application for

3852
01:34:16,490 --> 01:34:19,350
 

3853
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:21,449
 this is motivated by the following idea

3854
01:34:19,340 --> 01:34:21,449
 

3855
01:34:19,350 --> 01:34:24,050
 you have a big model you want to

3856
01:34:21,439 --> 01:34:24,050
 

3857
01:34:21,449 --> 01:34:27,180
 compress it without losing the models

3858
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:27,180
 

3859
01:34:24,050 --> 01:34:32,550
 predictive power what are you going to

3860
01:34:27,170 --> 01:34:32,550
 

3861
01:34:27,180 --> 01:34:34,380
 do so those of you who work in neural

3862
01:34:32,540 --> 01:34:34,380
 

3863
01:34:32,550 --> 01:34:36,570
 networks or compressing neural networks

3864
01:34:34,370 --> 01:34:36,570
 

3865
01:34:34,380 --> 01:34:39,900
 you may be aware of a variety of

3866
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:39,900
 

3867
01:34:36,570 --> 01:34:41,550
 heuristics to do this right people like

3868
01:34:39,890 --> 01:34:41,550
 

3869
01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:44,250
 to do this it's an important thing

3870
01:34:41,540 --> 01:34:44,250
 

3871
01:34:41,550 --> 01:34:48,030
 anytime you have say a big model you

3872
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:48,030
 

3873
01:34:44,250 --> 01:34:50,190
 trained on some cluster with thousand

3874
01:34:48,020 --> 01:34:50,190
 

3875
01:34:48,030 --> 01:34:51,780
 GPUs now you want to compress this model

3876
01:34:50,180 --> 01:34:51,780
 

3877
01:34:50,190 --> 01:34:53,460
 so you can deploy it if you want a

3878
01:34:51,770 --> 01:34:53,460
 

3879
01:34:51,780 --> 01:34:57,960
 version of it on your small hardware

3880
01:34:53,450 --> 01:34:57,960
 

3881
01:34:53,460 --> 01:34:59,880
 like this thing unless you have internet

3882
01:34:57,950 --> 01:34:59,880
 

3883
01:34:57,960 --> 01:35:01,620
 access so how would you go about model

3884
01:34:59,870 --> 01:35:01,620
 

3885
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:05,640
 compression without losing capability

3886
01:35:01,610 --> 01:35:05,640
 

3887
01:35:01,620 --> 01:35:08,310
 well means maybe my model is

3888
01:35:05,630 --> 01:35:08,310
 

3889
01:35:05,640 --> 01:35:10,410
 parametrized in a way that I can do a

3890
01:35:08,300 --> 01:35:10,410
 

3891
01:35:08,310 --> 01:35:15,989
 dependent sampling of the most diverse

3892
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:15,989
 

3893
01:35:10,410 --> 01:35:20,880
 parameters some select those reallocate

3894
01:35:15,979 --> 01:35:20,880
 

3895
01:35:15,989 --> 01:35:23,340
 the and then delete the rest while doing

3896
01:35:20,870 --> 01:35:23,340
 

3897
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:27,030
 some adjustment because I'm deleting and

3898
01:35:23,330 --> 01:35:27,030
 

3899
01:35:23,340 --> 01:35:29,960
 damaging the model might this simple

3900
01:35:27,020 --> 01:35:29,960
 

3901
01:35:27,030 --> 01:35:33,660
 minded thinking work and interestingly

3902
01:35:29,950 --> 01:35:33,660
 

3903
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:37,400
 we tried it on just a here's a toy kind

3904
01:35:33,650 --> 01:35:37,400
 

3905
01:35:33,660 --> 01:35:40,830
 of setup feed-forward neural look you

3906
01:35:37,390 --> 01:35:40,830
 

3907
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:42,630
 take a layer you see oh these neurons

3908
01:35:40,820 --> 01:35:42,630
 

3909
01:35:40,830 --> 01:35:45,270
 they of course you know they Co adapt a

3910
01:35:42,620 --> 01:35:45,270
 

3911
01:35:42,630 --> 01:35:48,239
 lot menu then they look repetitive so

3912
01:35:45,260 --> 01:35:48,239
 

3913
01:35:45,270 --> 01:35:49,659
 some of them they do know different

3914
01:35:48,229 --> 01:35:49,659
 

3915
01:35:48,239 --> 01:35:51,699
 things but many of them do

3916
01:35:49,649 --> 01:35:51,699
 

3917
01:35:49,659 --> 01:35:54,610
 things because because these things are

3918
01:35:51,689 --> 01:35:54,610
 

3919
01:35:51,699 --> 01:35:56,489
 almost always over parametrized so can

3920
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:56,489
 

3921
01:35:54,610 --> 01:36:04,630
 we delete some of the radar net ones

3922
01:35:56,479 --> 01:36:04,630
 

3923
01:35:56,489 --> 01:36:08,940
 challenge is which ones so even though I

3924
01:36:04,620 --> 01:36:08,940
 

3925
01:36:04,630 --> 01:36:11,679
 say ok fine again my theory of tutorials

3926
01:36:08,930 --> 01:36:11,679
 

3927
01:36:08,940 --> 01:36:13,510
 I'm gonna say some SR measure or some

3928
01:36:11,669 --> 01:36:13,510
 

3929
01:36:11,679 --> 01:36:16,540
 determinantal measure but which one

3930
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:16,540
 

3931
01:36:13,510 --> 01:36:18,460
 right can you learn that measure

3932
01:36:16,530 --> 01:36:18,460
 

3933
01:36:16,540 --> 01:36:21,280
 differentiable II would be great

3934
01:36:18,450 --> 01:36:21,280
 

3935
01:36:18,460 --> 01:36:22,690
 so once you start putting these things

3936
01:36:21,270 --> 01:36:22,690
 

3937
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:25,630
 into an application of course all those

3938
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:25,630
 

3939
01:36:22,690 --> 01:36:28,590
 concerns are important but suppose we

3940
01:36:25,620 --> 01:36:28,590
 

3941
01:36:25,630 --> 01:36:30,880
 pick some simple parameterised

3942
01:36:28,580 --> 01:36:30,880
 

3943
01:36:28,590 --> 01:36:32,679
 probability measure which allows us to

3944
01:36:30,870 --> 01:36:32,679
 

3945
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:34,690
 do this negatively dependent sampling

3946
01:36:32,669 --> 01:36:34,690
 

3947
01:36:32,679 --> 01:36:38,260
 and we do that or learn it from data

3948
01:36:34,680 --> 01:36:38,260
 

3949
01:36:34,690 --> 01:36:40,750
 this is a supervised task here sample

3950
01:36:38,250 --> 01:36:40,750
 

3951
01:36:38,260 --> 01:36:42,940
 according to that so this is done in

3952
01:36:40,740 --> 01:36:42,940
 

3953
01:36:40,750 --> 01:36:45,360
 work called diversity networks that we

3954
01:36:42,930 --> 01:36:45,360
 

3955
01:36:42,940 --> 01:36:49,239
 had worked on a couple of years ago

3956
01:36:45,350 --> 01:36:49,239
 

3957
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:51,429
 which that's exactly what I said and it

3958
01:36:49,229 --> 01:36:51,429
 

3959
01:36:49,239 --> 01:36:54,219
 had this interesting property that hey

3960
01:36:51,419 --> 01:36:54,219
 

3961
01:36:51,429 --> 01:36:56,949
 if I want to just randomly delete then

3962
01:36:54,209 --> 01:36:56,949
 

3963
01:36:54,219 --> 01:36:58,540
 it takes I have a lot of this is test

3964
01:36:56,939 --> 01:36:58,540
 

3965
01:36:56,949 --> 01:36:59,949
 error okay not training error because

3966
01:36:58,530 --> 01:36:59,949
 

3967
01:36:58,540 --> 01:37:02,949
 ultimately in machine learning that's

3968
01:36:59,939 --> 01:37:02,949
 

3969
01:36:59,949 --> 01:37:04,750
 what we really care about and if I do

3970
01:37:02,939 --> 01:37:04,750
 

3971
01:37:02,949 --> 01:37:06,730
 some kind of importance based pruning

3972
01:37:04,740 --> 01:37:06,730
 

3973
01:37:04,750 --> 01:37:08,260
 okay I can do better than random but if

3974
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:08,260
 

3975
01:37:06,730 --> 01:37:11,170
 I actually do carefully engineered

3976
01:37:08,250 --> 01:37:11,170
 

3977
01:37:08,260 --> 01:37:15,340
 diversity based pruning I can compress

3978
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:15,340
 

3979
01:37:11,170 --> 01:37:18,100
 the model by taking a much less severe

3980
01:37:15,330 --> 01:37:18,100
 

3981
01:37:15,340 --> 01:37:20,380
 hit on the prediction performance so

3982
01:37:18,090 --> 01:37:20,380
 

3983
01:37:18,100 --> 01:37:24,790
 this is just a proof of concept of how

3984
01:37:20,370 --> 01:37:24,790
 

3985
01:37:20,380 --> 01:37:28,239
 to go about compressing a big model and

3986
01:37:24,780 --> 01:37:28,239
 

3987
01:37:24,790 --> 01:37:30,340
 I invited to be creative about coming up

3988
01:37:28,229 --> 01:37:30,340
 

3989
01:37:28,239 --> 01:37:34,650
 with other settings and scenarios where

3990
01:37:30,330 --> 01:37:34,650
 

3991
01:37:30,340 --> 01:37:34,650
 you could profit from compressing models

3992
01:37:37,790 --> 01:37:37,790
 

3993
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:45,730
 so one other small application then I'll

3994
01:37:42,780 --> 01:37:45,730
 

3995
01:37:42,790 --> 01:37:49,659
 spend more time on slightly bigger

3996
01:37:45,720 --> 01:37:49,659
 

3997
01:37:45,730 --> 01:37:53,620
 application this is just us trying to

3998
01:37:49,649 --> 01:37:53,620
 

3999
01:37:49,659 --> 01:37:55,390
 see what else kind of correlates with

4000
01:37:53,610 --> 01:37:55,390
 

4001
01:37:53,620 --> 01:37:56,969
 diversity and what are some of the

4002
01:37:55,380 --> 01:37:56,969
 

4003
01:37:55,390 --> 01:38:01,600
 challenges that arise from that

4004
01:37:56,959 --> 01:38:01,600
 

4005
01:37:56,969 --> 01:38:04,630
 well sometimes trying to be overly

4006
01:38:01,590 --> 01:38:04,630
 

4007
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:06,400
 biased towards diversity please this is

4008
01:38:04,620 --> 01:38:06,400
 

4009
01:38:04,630 --> 01:38:10,290
 all in the context of math here only

4010
01:38:06,390 --> 01:38:10,290
 

4011
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:13,679
 nothing with the rest of the stuff you

4012
01:38:10,280 --> 01:38:13,679
 

4013
01:38:10,290 --> 01:38:16,060
 may tend to actually pick outliers

4014
01:38:13,669 --> 01:38:16,060
 

4015
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:17,860
 because they will look maximally

4016
01:38:16,050 --> 01:38:17,860
 

4017
01:38:16,060 --> 01:38:19,390
 different I mean that's the very

4018
01:38:17,850 --> 01:38:19,390
 

4019
01:38:17,860 --> 01:38:22,929
 definition it's a vague term right

4020
01:38:19,380 --> 01:38:22,929
 

4021
01:38:19,390 --> 01:38:25,179
 outlier is as good as fine-grained a

4022
01:38:22,919 --> 01:38:25,179
 

4023
01:38:22,929 --> 01:38:29,440
 mathematical term as diversity whatever

4024
01:38:25,169 --> 01:38:29,440
 

4025
01:38:25,179 --> 01:38:32,260
 that means right so then you may flip it

4026
01:38:29,430 --> 01:38:32,260
 

4027
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:35,770
 on its head and say fine then in that

4028
01:38:32,250 --> 01:38:35,770
 

4029
01:38:32,260 --> 01:38:40,350
 case we could use some tuned measures of

4030
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:40,350
 

4031
01:38:35,770 --> 01:38:40,350
 diversity to help do outlier detection

4032
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:42,200
 

4033
01:38:42,210 --> 01:38:48,010
 just another application that seems

4034
01:38:44,580 --> 01:38:48,010
 

4035
01:38:44,590 --> 01:38:50,170
 natural so in fact here I'm talking

4036
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,170
 

4037
01:38:48,010 --> 01:38:51,699
 about using that diversity measure where

4038
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:51,699
 

4039
01:38:50,170 --> 01:38:54,580
 I have this temperature parameter P

4040
01:38:51,689 --> 01:38:54,580
 

4041
01:38:51,699 --> 01:38:57,070
 equal to zero is uniform and SP grows

4042
01:38:54,570 --> 01:38:57,070
 

4043
01:38:54,580 --> 01:39:00,179
 bigger P equal to one is DP P P bigger

4044
01:38:57,060 --> 01:39:00,179
 

4045
01:38:57,070 --> 01:39:03,100
 than one is something stronger than DP P

4046
01:39:00,169 --> 01:39:03,100
 

4047
01:39:00,179 --> 01:39:05,020
 the preference for picking outliers will

4048
01:39:03,090 --> 01:39:05,020
 

4049
01:39:03,100 --> 01:39:07,420
 change accordingly so P is equal to half

4050
01:39:05,010 --> 01:39:07,420
 

4051
01:39:05,020 --> 01:39:09,580
 looks like this picture and as you

4052
01:39:07,410 --> 01:39:09,580
 

4053
01:39:07,420 --> 01:39:12,520
 compare visually P equal to one you can

4054
01:39:09,570 --> 01:39:12,520
 

4055
01:39:09,580 --> 01:39:16,840
 see bias towards outliers equal to two

4056
01:39:12,510 --> 01:39:16,840
 

4057
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:20,429
 and stronger bias and so on so in

4058
01:39:16,830 --> 01:39:20,429
 

4059
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:24,610
 particular this is one example of using

4060
01:39:20,419 --> 01:39:24,610
 

4061
01:39:20,429 --> 01:39:27,100
 those stronger notions of negative

4062
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:27,100
 

4063
01:39:24,610 --> 01:39:29,679
 dependence even though this is not an SR

4064
01:39:27,090 --> 01:39:29,679
 

4065
01:39:27,100 --> 01:39:31,330
 measure in general if you're just doing

4066
01:39:29,669 --> 01:39:31,330
 

4067
01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:33,340
 outlier detection within that

4068
01:39:31,320 --> 01:39:33,340
 

4069
01:39:31,330 --> 01:39:39,190
 application it seems to fit quite well

4070
01:39:33,330 --> 01:39:39,190
 

4071
01:39:33,340 --> 01:39:40,900
 and it works fairly well it has some

4072
01:39:39,180 --> 01:39:40,900
 

4073
01:39:39,190 --> 01:39:42,199
 very interesting mathematical properties

4074
01:39:40,890 --> 01:39:42,199
 

4075
01:39:40,900 --> 01:39:44,929
 which I don't have time

4076
01:39:42,189 --> 01:39:44,929
 

4077
01:39:42,199 --> 01:39:51,920
 go into but for those you should consult

4078
01:39:44,919 --> 01:39:51,920
 

4079
01:39:44,929 --> 01:39:54,709
 Zelda okay I will I think the last

4080
01:39:51,910 --> 01:39:54,709
 

4081
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:56,570
 application I want to talk with because

4082
01:39:54,699 --> 01:39:56,570
 

4083
01:39:54,709 --> 01:39:58,729
 this also branches out to establishing

4084
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:58,729
 

4085
01:39:56,570 --> 01:40:01,749
 connections to other areas that many of

4086
01:39:58,719 --> 01:40:01,749
 

4087
01:39:58,729 --> 01:40:04,459
 you may be familiar with is this

4088
01:40:01,739 --> 01:40:04,459
 

4089
01:40:01,749 --> 01:40:07,760
 application to optimal design and active

4090
01:40:04,449 --> 01:40:07,760
 

4091
01:40:04,459 --> 01:40:13,820
 learning so I just told this picture

4092
01:40:07,750 --> 01:40:13,820
 

4093
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:18,559
 from it from the IAC group the kind of

4094
01:40:13,810 --> 01:40:18,559
 

4095
01:40:13,820 --> 01:40:19,159
 motivation is experiments are expensive

4096
01:40:18,549 --> 01:40:19,159
 

4097
01:40:18,559 --> 01:40:21,769
 to run

4098
01:40:19,149 --> 01:40:21,769
 

4099
01:40:19,159 --> 01:40:23,510
 so one simplified version of this you

4100
01:40:21,759 --> 01:40:23,510
 

4101
01:40:21,769 --> 01:40:27,860
 can think in language of supervised

4102
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:27,860
 

4103
01:40:23,510 --> 01:40:33,320
 learning for many real problems getting

4104
01:40:27,850 --> 01:40:33,320
 

4105
01:40:27,860 --> 01:40:35,239
 labels is very hard and expensive but

4106
01:40:33,310 --> 01:40:35,239
 

4107
01:40:33,320 --> 01:40:40,749
 even if we could get the labels from an

4108
01:40:35,229 --> 01:40:40,749
 

4109
01:40:35,239 --> 01:40:40,749
 expert so this is not like mechanical

4110
01:40:42,689 --> 01:40:42,689
 

4111
01:40:42,699 --> 01:40:46,429
 running the experiment itself could be

4112
01:40:45,009 --> 01:40:46,429
 

4113
01:40:45,019 --> 01:40:48,170
 hard because this involves doing

4114
01:40:46,419 --> 01:40:48,170
 

4115
01:40:46,429 --> 01:40:49,519
 something in the wet labs you're trying

4116
01:40:48,160 --> 01:40:49,519
 

4117
01:40:48,170 --> 01:40:51,409
 to figure out something about a

4118
01:40:49,509 --> 01:40:51,409
 

4119
01:40:49,519 --> 01:40:53,959
 biological process a chemical process

4120
01:40:51,399 --> 01:40:53,959
 

4121
01:40:51,409 --> 01:40:56,090
 you have a limited budget so you can

4122
01:40:53,949 --> 01:40:56,090
 

4123
01:40:53,959 --> 01:40:58,760
 only carry out few experiments than you

4124
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:58,760
 

4125
01:40:56,090 --> 01:41:00,469
 as you're running the experiment you are

4126
01:40:58,750 --> 01:41:00,469
 

4127
01:40:58,760 --> 01:41:02,090
 kind of uncertain about whether you're

4128
01:41:00,459 --> 01:41:02,090
 

4129
01:41:00,469 --> 01:41:04,190
 maybe is explaining what you're

4130
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:04,190
 

4131
01:41:02,090 --> 01:41:06,440
 observing so you want to decrease your

4132
01:41:04,180 --> 01:41:06,440
 

4133
01:41:04,190 --> 01:41:08,659
 model uncertainty and how am I to

4134
01:41:06,430 --> 01:41:08,659
 

4135
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:10,729
 decrease the model uncertainty when

4136
01:41:08,649 --> 01:41:10,729
 

4137
01:41:08,659 --> 01:41:13,249
 figuring out it will be the next best

4138
01:41:10,719 --> 01:41:13,249
 

4139
01:41:10,729 --> 01:41:15,650
 experiment to run and so on so that kind

4140
01:41:13,239 --> 01:41:15,650
 

4141
01:41:13,249 --> 01:41:17,300
 of is an entire sub area called optimal

4142
01:41:15,640 --> 01:41:17,300
 

4143
01:41:15,650 --> 01:41:18,769
 design of experiments you can have a

4144
01:41:17,290 --> 01:41:18,769
 

4145
01:41:17,300 --> 01:41:20,929
 Bayesian approach to it you can have an

4146
01:41:18,759 --> 01:41:20,929
 

4147
01:41:18,769 --> 01:41:22,670
 online learning active different

4148
01:41:20,919 --> 01:41:22,670
 

4149
01:41:20,929 --> 01:41:25,340
 whichever way you want to think about it

4150
01:41:22,660 --> 01:41:25,340
 

4151
01:41:22,670 --> 01:41:27,170
 I'm just talking about one very

4152
01:41:25,330 --> 01:41:27,170
 

4153
01:41:25,340 --> 01:41:29,900
 simplistic set in which I will describe

4154
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:29,900
 

4155
01:41:27,170 --> 01:41:32,389
 in precise detail in the next slide is

4156
01:41:29,890 --> 01:41:32,389
 

4157
01:41:29,900 --> 01:41:35,900
 this particular motivation experiments

4158
01:41:32,379 --> 01:41:35,900
 

4159
01:41:32,389 --> 01:41:39,079
 are expensive to run I'm using some

4160
01:41:35,890 --> 01:41:39,079
 

4161
01:41:35,900 --> 01:41:42,499
 fixed model my model has uncertainty and

4162
01:41:39,069 --> 01:41:42,499
 

4163
01:41:39,079 --> 01:41:44,749
 I want to reduce my uncertainty by

4164
01:41:42,489 --> 01:41:44,749
 

4165
01:41:42,499 --> 01:41:48,199
 picking the right set of experiments to

4166
01:41:44,739 --> 01:41:48,199
 

4167
01:41:44,749 --> 01:41:52,489
 run what does this translate into formal

4168
01:41:48,189 --> 01:41:52,489
 

4169
01:41:48,199 --> 01:41:55,940
 language as this is the translation so

4170
01:41:52,479 --> 01:41:55,940
 

4171
01:41:52,489 --> 01:41:59,210
 suppose I have impossible experiment

4172
01:41:55,930 --> 01:41:59,210
 

4173
01:41:55,940 --> 01:42:02,210
 that I can run and each experiment

4174
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:02,210
 

4175
01:41:59,210 --> 01:42:04,010
 involves these measurements these are

4176
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:04,010
 

4177
01:42:02,210 --> 01:42:08,000
 vectors let's say n dimensional vectors

4178
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:08,000
 

4179
01:42:04,010 --> 01:42:09,710
 and there is scalar outcomes so just to

4180
01:42:07,990 --> 01:42:09,710
 

4181
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:13,760
 get the model across to you let's assume

4182
01:42:09,700 --> 01:42:13,760
 

4183
01:42:09,710 --> 01:42:15,710
 the trivial linear model the labels or

4184
01:42:13,750 --> 01:42:15,710
 

4185
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:18,760
 whatever regression values here are

4186
01:42:15,700 --> 01:42:18,760
 

4187
01:42:15,710 --> 01:42:23,480
 given by a linear function of the

4188
01:42:18,750 --> 01:42:23,480
 

4189
01:42:18,760 --> 01:42:25,580
 measurements in the aim one way of

4190
01:42:23,470 --> 01:42:25,580
 

4191
01:42:23,480 --> 01:42:27,739
 formulating this experimental design

4192
01:42:25,570 --> 01:42:27,739
 

4193
01:42:25,580 --> 01:42:30,230
 problem of picking optimal subsets of

4194
01:42:27,729 --> 01:42:30,230
 

4195
01:42:27,739 --> 01:42:32,210
 experiments this is just one way not the

4196
01:42:30,220 --> 01:42:32,210
 

4197
01:42:30,230 --> 01:42:38,570
 only way it's just for illustration but

4198
01:42:32,200 --> 01:42:38,570
 

4199
01:42:32,210 --> 01:42:42,830
 it's very widely used formulation is to

4200
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:42,830
 

4201
01:42:38,570 --> 01:42:44,960
 pick a subset of say size less than

4202
01:42:42,820 --> 01:42:44,960
 

4203
01:42:42,830 --> 01:42:47,630
 equal to K or say k case your budget of

4204
01:42:44,950 --> 01:42:47,630
 

4205
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:51,199
 which experiments to run to minimize

4206
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:51,199
 

4207
01:42:47,630 --> 01:42:58,670
 uncertainty so now you look at the

4208
01:42:51,189 --> 01:42:58,670
 

4209
01:42:51,199 --> 01:43:00,650
 covariance matrix inverse there and you

4210
01:42:58,660 --> 01:43:00,650
 

4211
01:42:58,670 --> 01:43:02,540
 can see it is indexed by I belonging to

4212
01:43:00,640 --> 01:43:02,540
 

4213
01:43:00,650 --> 01:43:06,230
 s so it's like the covariance of the

4214
01:43:02,530 --> 01:43:06,230
 

4215
01:43:02,540 --> 01:43:08,090
 experiments that you choose to run so

4216
01:43:06,220 --> 01:43:08,090
 

4217
01:43:06,230 --> 01:43:09,890
 the uncertainties characterize the

4218
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:09,890
 

4219
01:43:08,090 --> 01:43:12,980
 amount of uncertainty in there is given

4220
01:43:09,880 --> 01:43:12,980
 

4221
01:43:09,890 --> 01:43:16,190
 by that inverse and you want to minimize

4222
01:43:12,970 --> 01:43:16,190
 

4223
01:43:12,980 --> 01:43:18,219
 the uncertainty so you want to what do

4224
01:43:16,180 --> 01:43:18,219
 

4225
01:43:16,190 --> 01:43:21,410
 you want to do like that thing is a

4226
01:43:18,209 --> 01:43:21,410
 

4227
01:43:18,219 --> 01:43:24,110
 matrix so what is that five function Phi

4228
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:24,110
 

4229
01:43:21,410 --> 01:43:26,900
 function is just something that takes

4230
01:43:24,100 --> 01:43:26,900
 

4231
01:43:24,110 --> 01:43:28,699
 that uncertainty matrix spits out a

4232
01:43:26,890 --> 01:43:28,699
 

4233
01:43:26,900 --> 01:43:31,310
 single scalar for you so that you can

4234
01:43:28,689 --> 01:43:31,310
 

4235
01:43:28,699 --> 01:43:33,530
 understand some single number on what

4236
01:43:31,300 --> 01:43:33,530
 

4237
01:43:31,310 --> 01:43:35,090
 quantifies uncertainty and we want to

4238
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:35,090
 

4239
01:43:33,530 --> 01:43:37,580
 minimize the uncertainty so we have a

4240
01:43:35,080 --> 01:43:37,580
 

4241
01:43:35,090 --> 01:43:38,900
 budget so this is as you can see it

4242
01:43:37,570 --> 01:43:38,900
 

4243
01:43:37,580 --> 01:43:41,870
 looks like a combinatorial optimization

4244
01:43:38,890 --> 01:43:41,870
 

4245
01:43:38,900 --> 01:43:43,699
 problem it's developed in great detail

4246
01:43:41,860 --> 01:43:43,699
 

4247
01:43:41,870 --> 01:43:45,890
 if you okay there's a classic can

4248
01:43:43,689 --> 01:43:45,890
 

4249
01:43:43,699 --> 01:43:47,960
 reference text on it by pokel time

4250
01:43:45,880 --> 01:43:47,960
 

4251
01:43:45,890 --> 01:43:52,130
 called optimal design of experiments

4252
01:43:47,950 --> 01:43:52,130
 

4253
01:43:47,960 --> 01:43:53,660
 that outlines pretty nice story around

4254
01:43:52,120 --> 01:43:53,660
 

4255
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:55,910
 this whole topic so in case you're

4256
01:43:53,650 --> 01:43:55,910
 

4257
01:43:53,660 --> 01:44:01,489
 interested for the check that book out

4258
01:43:55,900 --> 01:44:01,489
 

4259
01:43:55,910 --> 01:44:07,550
 it was recently reprinted by Siam so

4260
01:44:01,479 --> 01:44:07,550
 

4261
01:44:01,489 --> 01:44:09,530
 here it is simultaneously so if

4262
01:44:07,540 --> 01:44:09,530
 

4263
01:44:07,550 --> 01:44:12,770
 that scaler ization function that's what

4264
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:12,770
 

4265
01:44:09,530 --> 01:44:15,530
 i'll call it if you take it to be the

4266
01:44:12,760 --> 01:44:15,530
 

4267
01:44:12,770 --> 01:44:18,460
 trace of that matrix you get what is

4268
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:18,460
 

4269
01:44:15,530 --> 01:44:22,909
 called a optimal design

4270
01:44:18,450 --> 01:44:22,909
 

4271
01:44:18,460 --> 01:44:25,730
 my guess is forever G if you take D to

4272
01:44:22,899 --> 01:44:25,730
 

4273
01:44:22,909 --> 01:44:27,889
 be the determinant you get what is

4274
01:44:25,720 --> 01:44:27,889
 

4275
01:44:25,730 --> 01:44:29,599
 called d optimal desire both of these

4276
01:44:27,879 --> 01:44:29,599
 

4277
01:44:27,889 --> 01:44:38,480
 are combinatorial optimization problems

4278
01:44:29,589 --> 01:44:38,480
 

4279
01:44:29,599 --> 01:44:40,670
 by the way and recently also yeah I

4280
01:44:38,470 --> 01:44:40,670
 

4281
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:43,659
 don't have all the citations here due to

4282
01:44:40,660 --> 01:44:43,659
 

4283
01:44:40,670 --> 01:44:46,400
 a shortage of space so if somebody

4284
01:44:43,649 --> 01:44:46,400
 

4285
01:44:43,659 --> 01:44:48,380
 thinks I missed anything please let me

4286
01:44:46,390 --> 01:44:48,380
 

4287
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:52,040
 know but these are some recent works

4288
01:44:48,370 --> 01:44:52,040
 

4289
01:44:48,380 --> 01:44:54,619
 that have considered coming up with

4290
01:44:52,030 --> 01:44:54,619
 

4291
01:44:52,040 --> 01:44:59,300
 approximation algorithms with guarantees

4292
01:44:54,609 --> 01:44:59,300
 

4293
01:44:54,619 --> 01:45:01,579
 for solving these problems so for a

4294
01:44:59,290 --> 01:45:01,579
 

4295
01:44:59,300 --> 01:45:04,969
 optimal there is that set of authors and

4296
01:45:01,569 --> 01:45:04,969
 

4297
01:45:01,579 --> 01:45:07,760
 the D optimal version has also been

4298
01:45:04,959 --> 01:45:07,760
 

4299
01:45:04,969 --> 01:45:11,500
 viewed as a as an application of general

4300
01:45:07,750 --> 01:45:11,500
 

4301
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:14,739
 theory developed by other authors and

4302
01:45:11,490 --> 01:45:14,739
 

4303
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:18,800
 those are the two most widely known ones

4304
01:45:14,729 --> 01:45:18,800
 

4305
01:45:14,739 --> 01:45:20,619
 interestingly if you instead of trace or

4306
01:45:18,790 --> 01:45:20,619
 

4307
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:22,550
 determinant you pick some other

4308
01:45:20,609 --> 01:45:22,550
 

4309
01:45:20,619 --> 01:45:24,520
 coefficient of the characteristic

4310
01:45:22,540 --> 01:45:24,520
 

4311
01:45:22,550 --> 01:45:26,780
 polynomial of a matrix also known as an

4312
01:45:24,510 --> 01:45:26,780
 

4313
01:45:24,520 --> 01:45:29,570
 this coefficient is also known as an

4314
01:45:26,770 --> 01:45:29,570
 

4315
01:45:26,780 --> 01:45:31,940
 elementary symmetric polynomial you can

4316
01:45:29,560 --> 01:45:31,940
 

4317
01:45:29,570 --> 01:45:38,920
 interpolate between the two extremes of

4318
01:45:31,930 --> 01:45:38,920
 

4319
01:45:31,940 --> 01:45:41,090
 a optimal nd optimum but the crux is

4320
01:45:38,910 --> 01:45:41,090
 

4321
01:45:38,920 --> 01:45:47,389
 that this is a combinatorial

4322
01:45:41,080 --> 01:45:47,389
 

4323
01:45:41,090 --> 01:45:50,630
 optimization problem and you there's a

4324
01:45:47,379 --> 01:45:50,630
 

4325
01:45:47,389 --> 01:45:53,690
 full set of them that you can solve but

4326
01:45:50,620 --> 01:45:53,690
 

4327
01:45:50,630 --> 01:45:57,739
 the most interesting consequence here of

4328
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:57,739
 

4329
01:45:53,690 --> 01:46:00,860
 negative dependence is that you can use

4330
01:45:57,729 --> 01:46:00,860
 

4331
01:45:57,739 --> 01:46:03,110
 some kind of greedy algorithm here to

4332
01:46:00,850 --> 01:46:03,110
 

4333
01:46:00,860 --> 01:46:05,059
 pick which experiments to run and you

4334
01:46:03,100 --> 01:46:05,059
 

4335
01:46:03,110 --> 01:46:08,800
 can prove how well does that greedy

4336
01:46:05,049 --> 01:46:08,800
 

4337
01:46:05,059 --> 01:46:12,469
 method perform and the proof of that

4338
01:46:08,790 --> 01:46:12,469
 

4339
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:13,470
 depends on so not the implementation the

4340
01:46:12,459 --> 01:46:13,470
 

4341
01:46:12,469 --> 01:46:18,990
 proof of

4342
01:46:13,460 --> 01:46:18,990
 

4343
01:46:13,470 --> 01:46:21,460
 being able to sample according to this

4344
01:46:18,980 --> 01:46:21,460
 

4345
01:46:18,990 --> 01:46:24,520
 probability measure which we call dual

4346
01:46:21,450 --> 01:46:24,520
 

4347
01:46:21,460 --> 01:46:26,650
 volume sampling which has definitely

4348
01:46:24,510 --> 01:46:26,650
 

4349
01:46:24,520 --> 01:46:29,140
 noted it's not a DPP but it's an SSR

4350
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:29,140
 

4351
01:46:26,650 --> 01:46:30,880
 measure and some of its value for

4352
01:46:29,130 --> 01:46:30,880
 

4353
01:46:29,140 --> 01:46:32,950
 experimental design actually was

4354
01:46:30,870 --> 01:46:32,950
 

4355
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:37,000
 outlined in this paper by everyone in

4356
01:46:32,940 --> 01:46:37,000
 

4357
01:46:32,950 --> 01:46:38,860
 book series in 2013 we looked at it's

4358
01:46:36,990 --> 01:46:38,860
 

4359
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:40,860
 the generalization of that theory to

4360
01:46:38,850 --> 01:46:40,860
 

4361
01:46:38,860 --> 01:46:43,270
 elementary symmetric polynomials and

4362
01:46:40,850 --> 01:46:43,270
 

4363
01:46:40,860 --> 01:46:46,090
 authors in this room like this in scheme

4364
01:46:43,260 --> 01:46:46,090
 

4365
01:46:43,270 --> 01:46:48,280
 and war mode they came up with a clever

4366
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:48,280
 

4367
01:46:46,090 --> 01:46:51,340
 procedure to sample very efficiently

4368
01:46:48,270 --> 01:46:51,340
 

4369
01:46:48,280 --> 01:46:53,920
 according to this measure we also looked

4370
01:46:51,330 --> 01:46:53,920
 

4371
01:46:51,340 --> 01:46:56,680
 at sampling from that by just invoking

4372
01:46:53,910 --> 01:46:56,680
 

4373
01:46:53,920 --> 01:46:59,380
 an MCMC procedure and there's quite a

4374
01:46:56,670 --> 01:46:59,380
 

4375
01:46:56,680 --> 01:47:02,980
 bit of interesting follow-up work from

4376
01:46:59,370 --> 01:47:02,980
 

4377
01:46:59,380 --> 01:47:05,650
 some of the authors in this topic so

4378
01:47:02,970 --> 01:47:05,650
 

4379
01:47:02,980 --> 01:47:07,630
 this turns out this measures okay turns

4380
01:47:05,640 --> 01:47:07,630
 

4381
01:47:05,650 --> 01:47:09,550
 out to be negatively dependent SR

4382
01:47:07,620 --> 01:47:09,550
 

4383
01:47:07,630 --> 01:47:12,460
 etcetera valuable for experimental

4384
01:47:09,540 --> 01:47:12,460
 

4385
01:47:09,550 --> 01:47:14,590
 design but and hence it has several

4386
01:47:12,450 --> 01:47:14,590
 

4387
01:47:12,460 --> 01:47:15,700
 implications for regression but it also

4388
01:47:14,580 --> 01:47:15,700
 

4389
01:47:14,590 --> 01:47:17,290
 turns out to have several other

4390
01:47:15,690 --> 01:47:17,290
 

4391
01:47:15,700 --> 01:47:21,520
 interesting properties that people have

4392
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:21,520
 

4393
01:47:17,290 --> 01:47:25,720
 recently investigated so now I've kind

4394
01:47:21,510 --> 01:47:25,720
 

4395
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:29,500
 of shared with you a diverse subset of

4396
01:47:25,710 --> 01:47:29,500
 

4397
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:33,660
 applications of diversity so that kind

4398
01:47:29,490 --> 01:47:33,660
 

4399
01:47:29,500 --> 01:47:36,760
 of is the end of the diversity and

4400
01:47:33,650 --> 01:47:36,760
 

4401
01:47:33,660 --> 01:47:38,230
 stable polynomial story so in the

4402
01:47:36,750 --> 01:47:38,230
 

4403
01:47:36,760 --> 01:47:41,380
 remaining time let me just try to

4404
01:47:38,220 --> 01:47:41,380
 

4405
01:47:38,230 --> 01:47:44,230
 quickly wrap up by telling you one quick

4406
01:47:41,370 --> 01:47:44,230
 

4407
01:47:41,380 --> 01:47:46,660
 aside for enthusiasts and aficionados in

4408
01:47:44,220 --> 01:47:46,660
 

4409
01:47:44,230 --> 01:47:49,030
 the room and then a quick wrap-up okay

4410
01:47:46,650 --> 01:47:49,030
 

4411
01:47:46,660 --> 01:47:52,090
 so here's a quick superfast this one

4412
01:47:49,020 --> 01:47:52,090
 

4413
01:47:49,030 --> 01:47:54,340
 will be fast so the dude of the D

4414
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:54,340
 

4415
01:47:52,090 --> 01:47:56,170
 optimal design problem is also known as

4416
01:47:54,330 --> 01:47:56,170
 

4417
01:47:54,340 --> 01:47:57,580
 the minimum volume covering ellipsoid

4418
01:47:56,160 --> 01:47:57,580
 

4419
01:47:56,170 --> 01:47:59,560
 problem which is one of the most

4420
01:47:57,570 --> 01:47:59,560
 

4421
01:47:57,580 --> 01:48:01,630
 fundamental geometric problems in convex

4422
01:47:59,550 --> 01:48:01,630
 

4423
01:47:59,560 --> 01:48:03,010
 optimization okay comes up in the

4424
01:48:01,620 --> 01:48:03,010
 

4425
01:48:01,630 --> 01:48:05,440
 analysis of theory of interior point

4426
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,440
 

4427
01:48:03,010 --> 01:48:06,760
 methods also there's a nice monograph

4428
01:48:05,430 --> 01:48:06,760
 

4429
01:48:05,440 --> 01:48:09,370
 written by Michael taught on that

4430
01:48:06,750 --> 01:48:09,370
 

4431
01:48:06,760 --> 01:48:11,380
 published in 2016 essentially it ends up

4432
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:11,380
 

4433
01:48:09,370 --> 01:48:14,410
 looking like this max log data block so

4434
01:48:11,370 --> 01:48:14,410
 

4435
01:48:11,380 --> 01:48:18,100
 it's a convex relaxation objective is

4436
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:18,100
 

4437
01:48:14,410 --> 01:48:19,960
 concave here so here we see that Wow

4438
01:48:18,090 --> 01:48:19,960
 

4439
01:48:18,100 --> 01:48:22,040
 there was optimal design then it was

4440
01:48:19,950 --> 01:48:22,040
 

4441
01:48:19,960 --> 01:48:23,660
 connected to stable polynomials and some

4442
01:48:22,030 --> 01:48:23,660
 

4443
01:48:22,040 --> 01:48:25,310
 then there's a convex relaxation of a

4444
01:48:23,650 --> 01:48:25,310
 

4445
01:48:23,660 --> 01:48:27,290
 combinatorial problem which connects to

4446
01:48:25,300 --> 01:48:27,290
 

4447
01:48:25,310 --> 01:48:30,860
 deep stuff in geometry and optimization

4448
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:30,860
 

4449
01:48:27,290 --> 01:48:34,490
 so doing that with more general than the

4450
01:48:30,850 --> 01:48:34,490
 

4451
01:48:30,860 --> 01:48:35,870
 optimal is an interesting stuff that you

4452
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:35,870
 

4453
01:48:34,490 --> 01:48:39,470
 could think about for that is you notice

4454
01:48:35,860 --> 01:48:39,470
 

4455
01:48:35,870 --> 01:48:41,270
 okay so there's a bunch of other MLF no

4456
01:48:39,460 --> 01:48:41,270
 

4457
01:48:39,470 --> 01:48:44,270
 time to talk about those I listed few

4458
01:48:41,260 --> 01:48:44,270
 

4459
01:48:41,270 --> 01:48:45,710
 some of the broader version of these

4460
01:48:44,260 --> 01:48:45,710
 

4461
01:48:44,270 --> 01:48:47,960
 things you would see of course within

4462
01:48:45,700 --> 01:48:47,960
 

4463
01:48:45,710 --> 01:48:50,270
 locks of modularity there's been a bunch

4464
01:48:47,950 --> 01:48:50,270
 

4465
01:48:47,960 --> 01:48:52,880
 of tutorials on that the idea of

4466
01:48:50,260 --> 01:48:52,880
 

4467
01:48:50,270 --> 01:48:54,650
 diversity people have been exploring now

4468
01:48:52,870 --> 01:48:54,650
 

4469
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:57,770
 in reinforcement learning because you

4470
01:48:54,640 --> 01:48:57,770
 

4471
01:48:54,650 --> 01:48:59,870
 want to explore nicely not always

4472
01:48:57,760 --> 01:48:59,870
 

4473
01:48:57,770 --> 01:49:02,180
 exploit so diversity becomes important

4474
01:48:59,860 --> 01:49:02,180
 

4475
01:48:59,870 --> 01:49:03,890
 same as this is what's definitely

4476
01:49:02,170 --> 01:49:03,890
 

4477
01:49:02,180 --> 01:49:06,980
 mentioned within fairness in machine

4478
01:49:03,880 --> 01:49:06,980
 

4479
01:49:03,890 --> 01:49:10,190
 learning or summarizing videos you want

4480
01:49:06,970 --> 01:49:10,190
 

4481
01:49:06,980 --> 01:49:11,660
 to extract a subset of frames to

4482
01:49:10,180 --> 01:49:11,660
 

4483
01:49:10,190 --> 01:49:15,800
 summarize a video without being

4484
01:49:11,650 --> 01:49:15,800
 

4485
01:49:11,660 --> 01:49:16,720
 redundant while being meaningful and so

4486
01:49:15,790 --> 01:49:16,720
 

4487
01:49:15,800 --> 01:49:21,170
 on

4488
01:49:16,710 --> 01:49:21,170
 

4489
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:24,230
 so I will when I update the website

4490
01:49:21,160 --> 01:49:24,230
 

4491
01:49:21,170 --> 01:49:27,110
 I'll there's a website corresponding to

4492
01:49:24,220 --> 01:49:27,110
 

4493
01:49:24,230 --> 01:49:32,210
 this tutorial the website will actually

4494
01:49:27,100 --> 01:49:32,210
 

4495
01:49:27,110 --> 01:49:34,550
 have links clickable links for you guys

4496
01:49:32,200 --> 01:49:34,550
 

4497
01:49:32,210 --> 01:49:36,580
 there in case anybody wants to follow up

4498
01:49:34,540 --> 01:49:36,580
 

4499
01:49:34,550 --> 01:49:39,380
 later and change the references okay

4500
01:49:36,570 --> 01:49:39,380
 

4501
01:49:36,580 --> 01:49:41,570
 this bunch of work I just I searched

4502
01:49:39,370 --> 01:49:41,570
 

4503
01:49:39,380 --> 01:49:43,070
 maybe I I hope I didn't miss anything if

4504
01:49:41,560 --> 01:49:43,070
 

4505
01:49:41,570 --> 01:49:44,900
 I did please let me know I can update my

4506
01:49:43,060 --> 01:49:44,900
 

4507
01:49:43,070 --> 01:49:47,570
 slides there's a bunch of related

4508
01:49:44,890 --> 01:49:47,570
 

4509
01:49:44,900 --> 01:49:50,240
 diversity related not necessarily stable

4510
01:49:47,560 --> 01:49:50,240
 

4511
01:49:47,570 --> 01:49:53,180
 polynomial but diversity related papers

4512
01:49:50,230 --> 01:49:53,180
 

4513
01:49:50,240 --> 01:49:57,380
 at this conference and there's actually

4514
01:49:53,170 --> 01:49:57,380
 

4515
01:49:53,180 --> 01:49:59,930
 several of those I'm not going to speak

4516
01:49:57,370 --> 01:49:59,930
 

4517
01:49:57,380 --> 01:50:01,610
 one by one through this is just slide is

4518
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:01,610
 

4519
01:49:59,930 --> 01:50:05,180
 there my slides will be online soon so

4520
01:50:01,600 --> 01:50:05,180
 

4521
01:50:01,610 --> 01:50:07,880
 you can get this anyways and if you

4522
01:50:05,170 --> 01:50:07,880
 

4523
01:50:05,180 --> 01:50:15,920
 didn't take a picture yet so let's try

4524
01:50:07,870 --> 01:50:15,920
 

4525
01:50:07,880 --> 01:50:17,270
 to wrap up now after all of that is we

4526
01:50:15,910 --> 01:50:17,270
 

4527
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:19,670
 talked a lot about this table

4528
01:50:17,260 --> 01:50:19,670
 

4529
01:50:17,270 --> 01:50:21,080
 polynomials and their applications and

4530
01:50:19,660 --> 01:50:21,080
 

4531
01:50:19,670 --> 01:50:23,990
 some of their generalizations some

4532
01:50:21,070 --> 01:50:23,990
 

4533
01:50:21,080 --> 01:50:27,350
 theories and whatnot there has been some

4534
01:50:23,980 --> 01:50:27,350
 

4535
01:50:23,990 --> 01:50:32,360
 recent progress recent as in as of

4536
01:50:27,340 --> 01:50:32,360
 

4537
01:50:27,350 --> 01:50:34,340
 November so pretty recent progress that

4538
01:50:32,350 --> 01:50:34,340
 

4539
01:50:32,360 --> 01:50:35,470
 I thought I'll share with you in this

4540
01:50:34,330 --> 01:50:35,470
 

4541
01:50:34,340 --> 01:50:38,390
 two

4542
01:50:35,460 --> 01:50:38,390
 

4543
01:50:35,470 --> 01:50:41,170
 so it's leaving the world of negative

4544
01:50:38,380 --> 01:50:41,170
 

4545
01:50:38,390 --> 01:50:43,790
 dependence a little bit but not fully

4546
01:50:41,160 --> 01:50:43,790
 

4547
01:50:41,170 --> 01:50:46,430
 Stephane hinted at that so there is

4548
01:50:43,780 --> 01:50:46,430
 

4549
01:50:43,790 --> 01:50:49,910
 actually once again our friend Gurewitz

4550
01:50:46,420 --> 01:50:49,910
 

4551
01:50:46,430 --> 01:50:52,010
 introduced in 2009 the class of

4552
01:50:49,900 --> 01:50:52,010
 

4553
01:50:49,910 --> 01:50:55,250
 polynomials which he called strongly log

4554
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:55,250
 

4555
01:50:52,010 --> 01:50:57,410
 2k polynomials so he introduced first

4556
01:50:55,240 --> 01:50:57,410
 

4557
01:50:55,250 --> 01:51:00,950
 stable polynomials to partition function

4558
01:50:57,400 --> 01:51:00,950
 

4559
01:50:57,410 --> 01:51:02,930
 estimation then he said Wow stable

4560
01:51:00,940 --> 01:51:02,930
 

4561
01:51:00,950 --> 01:51:05,030
 polynomials help me estimate partition

4562
01:51:02,920 --> 01:51:05,030
 

4563
01:51:02,930 --> 01:51:06,410
 functions are they the only polynomials

4564
01:51:05,020 --> 01:51:06,410
 

4565
01:51:05,030 --> 01:51:09,260
 that help me estimate partition

4566
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:09,260
 

4567
01:51:06,410 --> 01:51:12,200
 functions you could have asked that

4568
01:51:09,250 --> 01:51:12,200
 

4569
01:51:09,260 --> 01:51:13,700
 question also right so he asked that

4570
01:51:12,190 --> 01:51:13,700
 

4571
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:15,350
 question and he came up with a class of

4572
01:51:13,690 --> 01:51:15,350
 

4573
01:51:13,700 --> 01:51:17,030
 polynomials to help him estimate

4574
01:51:15,340 --> 01:51:17,030
 

4575
01:51:15,350 --> 01:51:19,190
 partition functions of more complicated

4576
01:51:17,020 --> 01:51:19,190
 

4577
01:51:17,030 --> 01:51:23,330
 probability measures and he calls those

4578
01:51:19,180 --> 01:51:23,330
 

4579
01:51:19,190 --> 01:51:25,070
 strongly locked concave polynomials it's

4580
01:51:23,320 --> 01:51:25,070
 

4581
01:51:23,330 --> 01:51:27,130
 actually a pretty impressive set of

4582
01:51:25,060 --> 01:51:27,130
 

4583
01:51:25,070 --> 01:51:30,080
 things that one can do with that and

4584
01:51:27,120 --> 01:51:30,080
 

4585
01:51:27,130 --> 01:51:33,010
 recently these polynomials their

4586
01:51:30,070 --> 01:51:33,010
 

4587
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:38,110
 properties were further developed by

4588
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:38,110
 

4589
01:51:33,010 --> 01:51:41,210
 some authors Aaron Vincent who actually

4590
01:51:38,100 --> 01:51:41,210
 

4591
01:51:38,110 --> 01:51:43,220
 then developed further properties of

4592
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:43,220
 

4593
01:51:41,210 --> 01:51:45,310
 this slc polynomials and use those to

4594
01:51:43,210 --> 01:51:45,310
 

4595
01:51:43,220 --> 01:51:50,000
 solve some long-standing conjectures in

4596
01:51:45,300 --> 01:51:50,000
 

4597
01:51:45,310 --> 01:51:53,900
 combinatorics including something of

4598
01:51:49,990 --> 01:51:53,900
 

4599
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:56,060
 direct value for us including giving a

4600
01:51:53,890 --> 01:51:56,060
 

4601
01:51:53,900 --> 01:51:58,220
 concrete example of a larger class of

4602
01:51:56,050 --> 01:51:58,220
 

4603
01:51:56,060 --> 01:52:01,600
 polynomials where you can get fast

4604
01:51:58,210 --> 01:52:01,600
 

4605
01:51:58,220 --> 01:52:06,560
 mixing Markov chain Monte Carlo without

4606
01:52:01,590 --> 01:52:06,560
 

4607
01:52:01,600 --> 01:52:08,330
 always requiring the sr property of

4608
01:52:06,550 --> 01:52:08,330
 

4609
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:10,160
 course you give up you lose a few things

4610
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:10,160
 

4611
01:52:08,330 --> 01:52:12,080
 when you go out of stable polynomial and

4612
01:52:10,150 --> 01:52:12,080
 

4613
01:52:10,160 --> 01:52:13,640
 your constants may worsen you may have

4614
01:52:12,070 --> 01:52:13,640
 

4615
01:52:12,080 --> 01:52:15,620
 less precise rates you may have less

4616
01:52:13,630 --> 01:52:15,620
 

4617
01:52:13,640 --> 01:52:18,160
 precise things to say but at least you

4618
01:52:15,610 --> 01:52:18,160
 

4619
01:52:15,620 --> 01:52:24,080
 can say something rather than nothing

4620
01:52:18,150 --> 01:52:24,080
 

4621
01:52:18,160 --> 01:52:26,300
 and in particular for the fractional

4622
01:52:24,070 --> 01:52:26,300
 

4623
01:52:24,080 --> 01:52:28,670
 version the exponentiated version of sr

4624
01:52:26,290 --> 01:52:28,670
 

4625
01:52:26,300 --> 01:52:31,730
 measures as long as the fraction is

4626
01:52:28,660 --> 01:52:31,730
 

4627
01:52:28,670 --> 01:52:33,310
 smaller than 1 you actually even though

4628
01:52:31,720 --> 01:52:33,310
 

4629
01:52:31,730 --> 01:52:37,570
 you leave SR land

4630
01:52:33,300 --> 01:52:37,570
 

4631
01:52:33,310 --> 01:52:39,880
 remain in the slc land so something

4632
01:52:37,560 --> 01:52:39,880
 

4633
01:52:37,570 --> 01:52:42,700
 works out this is super super fast

4634
01:52:39,870 --> 01:52:42,700
 

4635
01:52:39,880 --> 01:52:44,050
 because this is very recent stuff don't

4636
01:52:42,690 --> 01:52:44,050
 

4637
01:52:42,700 --> 01:52:45,910
 have time to go into that of course

4638
01:52:44,040 --> 01:52:45,910
 

4639
01:52:44,050 --> 01:52:48,280
 whether it will have applications at all

4640
01:52:45,900 --> 01:52:48,280
 

4641
01:52:45,910 --> 01:52:51,940
 in machine learning leaves to be seen to

4642
01:52:48,270 --> 01:52:51,940
 

4643
01:52:48,280 --> 01:52:55,060
 the creativity of the audience here okay

4644
01:52:51,930 --> 01:52:55,060
 

4645
01:52:51,940 --> 01:52:56,830
 so I already spoke that so let me not

4646
01:52:55,050 --> 01:52:56,830
 

4647
01:52:55,060 --> 01:52:58,810
 Reis peak that summary let me conclude

4648
01:52:56,820 --> 01:52:58,810
 

4649
01:52:56,830 --> 01:53:04,120
 with an Outlook and then I will stop so

4650
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:04,120
 

4651
01:52:58,810 --> 01:53:08,200
 the outlook is here hate went away I did

4652
01:53:04,110 --> 01:53:08,200
 

4653
01:53:04,120 --> 01:53:13,830
 too much animation oops let me bring it

4654
01:53:08,190 --> 01:53:13,830
 

4655
01:53:08,200 --> 01:53:18,910
 back cuz that sucks so here is the

4656
01:53:13,820 --> 01:53:18,910
 

4657
01:53:13,830 --> 01:53:20,950
 outlook I hinted at this but there's a

4658
01:53:18,900 --> 01:53:20,950
 

4659
01:53:18,910 --> 01:53:23,230
 beautiful number of deeper connections

4660
01:53:20,940 --> 01:53:23,230
 

4661
01:53:20,950 --> 01:53:26,410
 to the world of optimization that stable

4662
01:53:23,220 --> 01:53:26,410
 

4663
01:53:23,230 --> 01:53:28,690
 polynomials enjoy uncovering those

4664
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:28,690
 

4665
01:53:26,410 --> 01:53:33,160
 connections for people who care about

4666
01:53:28,680 --> 01:53:33,160
 

4667
01:53:28,690 --> 01:53:37,600
 optimization like me is an important to

4668
01:53:33,150 --> 01:53:37,600
 

4669
01:53:33,160 --> 01:53:40,450
 do modeling diversity I mentioned to you

4670
01:53:37,590 --> 01:53:40,450
 

4671
01:53:37,600 --> 01:53:42,430
 from the recommender system example that

4672
01:53:40,440 --> 01:53:42,430
 

4673
01:53:40,450 --> 01:53:45,340
 find a model has some notion of

4674
01:53:42,420 --> 01:53:45,340
 

4675
01:53:42,430 --> 01:53:46,720
 diversity but a user or sets of users

4676
01:53:45,330 --> 01:53:46,720
 

4677
01:53:45,340 --> 01:53:49,660
 different people we have different

4678
01:53:46,710 --> 01:53:49,660
 

4679
01:53:46,720 --> 01:53:51,730
 notions of diversity so how should we go

4680
01:53:49,650 --> 01:53:51,730
 

4681
01:53:49,660 --> 01:53:54,700
 about modeling diversity just like there

4682
01:53:51,720 --> 01:53:54,700
 

4683
01:53:51,730 --> 01:53:56,820
 is a lot of enthusiasm in the community

4684
01:53:54,690 --> 01:53:56,820
 

4685
01:53:54,700 --> 01:54:00,130
 currently for modeling fairness

4686
01:53:56,810 --> 01:54:00,130
 

4687
01:53:56,820 --> 01:54:07,410
 similarly I think the time is right to

4688
01:54:00,120 --> 01:54:07,410
 

4689
01:54:00,130 --> 01:54:11,170
 talk about how do we model diversity and

4690
01:54:07,400 --> 01:54:11,170
 

4691
01:54:07,410 --> 01:54:15,280
 I hinted at ok SLC does something for

4692
01:54:11,160 --> 01:54:15,280
 

4693
01:54:11,170 --> 01:54:19,110
 MCMC but can one cook up a comprehensive

4694
01:54:15,270 --> 01:54:19,110
 

4695
01:54:15,280 --> 01:54:22,510
 theory of sampling and approximation

4696
01:54:19,100 --> 01:54:22,510
 

4697
01:54:19,110 --> 01:54:27,870
 which is richer than just the the story

4698
01:54:22,500 --> 01:54:27,870
 

4699
01:54:22,510 --> 01:54:30,400
 I told you today and beyond that as

4700
01:54:27,860 --> 01:54:30,400
 

4701
01:54:27,870 --> 01:54:34,540
 application suggests you cannot always

4702
01:54:30,390 --> 01:54:34,540
 

4703
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:36,550
 bias yourself to either just negative

4704
01:54:34,530 --> 01:54:36,550
 

4705
01:54:34,540 --> 01:54:38,890
 dependence or just positive dependence

4706
01:54:36,540 --> 01:54:38,890
 

4707
01:54:36,550 --> 01:54:42,970
 can we come up with a graded and

4708
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:42,970
 

4709
01:54:38,890 --> 01:54:46,630
 controlled manner on how to model and

4710
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:46,630
 

4711
01:54:42,970 --> 01:54:46,860
 mix and use efficiently both positive

4712
01:54:46,620 --> 01:54:46,860
 

4713
01:54:46,630 --> 01:54:48,900
 and

4714
01:54:46,850 --> 01:54:48,900
 

4715
01:54:46,860 --> 01:54:51,360
 negative dependence in our applications

4716
01:54:48,890 --> 01:54:51,360
 

4717
01:54:48,900 --> 01:54:54,690
 and of course in our math so those are

4718
01:54:51,350 --> 01:54:54,690
 

4719
01:54:51,360 --> 01:54:58,710
 like some rough outlook directions and I

4720
01:54:54,680 --> 01:54:58,710
 

4721
01:54:54,690 --> 01:55:06,570
 think with that I will stop and thank

4722
01:54:58,700 --> 01:55:06,570
 

4723
01:54:58,710 --> 01:55:09,690
 the two students whose work contributed

4724
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:09,690
 

4725
01:55:06,570 --> 01:55:21,179
 a lot to both Stephanie and my shares of

4726
01:55:09,680 --> 01:55:21,179
 

4727
01:55:09,690 --> 01:55:23,280
 the work on this topic thank you thank

4728
01:55:21,169 --> 01:55:23,280
 

4729
01:55:21,179 --> 01:55:25,020
 you so it's time for questions if you

4730
01:55:23,270 --> 01:55:25,020
 

4731
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:31,619
 have questions please come to the two

4732
01:55:25,010 --> 01:55:31,619
 

4733
01:55:25,020 --> 01:55:35,250
 microphones the understanding line this

4734
01:55:31,609 --> 01:55:35,250
 

4735
01:55:31,619 --> 01:55:36,750
 on yeah okay thanks for great tutorial

4736
01:55:35,240 --> 01:55:36,750
 

4737
01:55:35,250 --> 01:55:41,130
 this is new to me and this was awesome

4738
01:55:36,740 --> 01:55:41,130
 

4739
01:55:36,750 --> 01:55:43,440
 so you I think I don't know if I made a

4740
01:55:41,120 --> 01:55:43,440
 

4741
01:55:41,130 --> 01:55:46,920
 mistake but is it can can this be

4742
01:55:43,430 --> 01:55:46,920
 

4743
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:50,280
 extended also to continuous spaces so

4744
01:55:46,910 --> 01:55:50,280
 

4745
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:54,179
 excellent question so M people continue

4746
01:55:50,270 --> 01:55:54,179
 

4747
01:55:50,280 --> 01:55:56,219
 to go out he's asking can we talk about

4748
01:55:54,169 --> 01:55:56,219
 

4749
01:55:54,179 --> 01:55:58,980
 these distributions over continuous

4750
01:55:56,209 --> 01:55:58,980
 

4751
01:55:56,219 --> 01:56:02,280
 spaces and via the answer is yes you

4752
01:55:58,970 --> 01:56:02,280
 

4753
01:55:58,980 --> 01:56:15,659
 just need some more I see and do you see

4754
01:56:02,270 --> 01:56:15,659
 

4755
01:56:02,280 --> 01:56:19,710
 any can you put that reference up also

4756
01:56:15,649 --> 01:56:19,710
 

4757
01:56:15,659 --> 01:56:22,290
 in the and also my second question is do

4758
01:56:19,700 --> 01:56:22,290
 

4759
01:56:19,710 --> 01:56:24,719
 you see potentials in thinking about non

4760
01:56:22,280 --> 01:56:24,719
 

4761
01:56:22,290 --> 01:56:26,580
 convex optimization because I can

4762
01:56:24,709 --> 01:56:26,580
 

4763
01:56:24,719 --> 01:56:34,920
 intuitively think that in some sense

4764
01:56:26,570 --> 01:56:34,920
 

4765
01:56:26,580 --> 01:56:37,980
 diversity could help - let me guess it's

4766
01:56:34,910 --> 01:56:37,980
 

4767
01:56:34,920 --> 01:56:39,330
 coming from this idea that in non convex

4768
01:56:37,970 --> 01:56:39,330
 

4769
01:56:37,980 --> 01:56:41,460
 optimization

4770
01:56:39,320 --> 01:56:41,460
 

4771
01:56:39,330 --> 01:56:44,100
 how could diversity help in non convex

4772
01:56:41,450 --> 01:56:44,100
 

4773
01:56:41,460 --> 01:56:45,160
 optimization what answer is already

4774
01:56:44,090 --> 01:56:45,160
 

4775
01:56:44,100 --> 01:56:46,540
 there in some of the

4776
01:56:45,150 --> 01:56:46,540
 

4777
01:56:45,160 --> 01:56:48,250
 Frances eyesight people who are doing

4778
01:56:46,530 --> 01:56:48,250
 

4779
01:56:46,540 --> 01:56:51,760
 vision optimization to do global

4780
01:56:48,240 --> 01:56:51,760
 

4781
01:56:48,250 --> 01:56:53,940
 optimization of blackbox functions they

4782
01:56:51,750 --> 01:56:53,940
 

4783
01:56:51,760 --> 01:56:57,610
 choose to explore the space using

4784
01:56:53,930 --> 01:56:57,610
 

4785
01:56:53,940 --> 01:57:00,220
 diversity to explore it better enhance

4786
01:56:57,600 --> 01:57:00,220
 

4787
01:56:57,610 --> 01:57:04,330
 attain a better solution so yes there is

4788
01:57:00,210 --> 01:57:04,330
 

4789
01:57:00,220 --> 01:57:06,340
 already some proof-of-concept box and

4790
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:06,340
 

4791
01:57:04,330 --> 01:57:08,890
 you use gradients and sub gradients what

4792
01:57:06,330 --> 01:57:08,890
 

4793
01:57:06,340 --> 01:57:10,780
 not then what can you do

4794
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:10,780
 

4795
01:57:08,890 --> 01:57:12,670
 remains to be seen but there is

4796
01:57:10,770 --> 01:57:12,670
 

4797
01:57:10,780 --> 01:57:15,570
 potential noise and that's in a discrete

4798
01:57:12,660 --> 01:57:15,570
 

4799
01:57:12,670 --> 01:57:15,570
 case that reference

4800
01:57:26,070 --> 01:57:26,070
 

4801
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:30,130
 great talk really enjoyed it I'm afraid

4802
01:57:28,530 --> 01:57:30,130
 

4803
01:57:28,540 --> 01:57:32,230
 I'm not much of an expert so I apologize

4804
01:57:30,120 --> 01:57:32,230
 

4805
01:57:30,130 --> 01:57:34,510
 to this question is naive but this is

4806
01:57:32,220 --> 01:57:34,510
 

4807
01:57:32,230 --> 01:57:35,530
 with application to the things you were

4808
01:57:34,500 --> 01:57:35,530
 

4809
01:57:34,510 --> 01:57:37,930
 talking about with respect to

4810
01:57:35,520 --> 01:57:37,930
 

4811
01:57:35,530 --> 01:57:39,520
 reinforcement learning so there the

4812
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:39,520
 

4813
01:57:37,930 --> 01:57:40,810
 field seems to have started to settle on

4814
01:57:39,510 --> 01:57:40,810
 

4815
01:57:39,520 --> 01:57:42,640
 a notion of diversity based around

4816
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:42,640
 

4817
01:57:40,810 --> 01:57:45,220
 maximum entropy or if you want to visit

4818
01:57:42,630 --> 01:57:45,220
 

4819
01:57:42,640 --> 01:57:46,750
 diverse trajectories through state space

4820
01:57:45,210 --> 01:57:46,750
 

4821
01:57:45,220 --> 01:57:48,310
 you should maximize the entropy of your

4822
01:57:46,740 --> 01:57:48,310
 

4823
01:57:46,750 --> 01:57:49,990
 policy and I was wondering how the

4824
01:57:48,300 --> 01:57:49,990
 

4825
01:57:48,310 --> 01:57:52,690
 things you've been talking about relate

4826
01:57:49,980 --> 01:57:52,690
 

4827
01:57:49,990 --> 01:57:54,640
 to that formulation so the question

4828
01:57:52,680 --> 01:57:54,640
 

4829
01:57:52,690 --> 01:57:56,200
 again I hopefully people heard that okay

4830
01:57:54,630 --> 01:57:56,200
 

4831
01:57:54,640 --> 01:57:57,910
 in reinforcement learning people are

4832
01:57:56,190 --> 01:57:57,910
 

4833
01:57:56,200 --> 01:58:00,460
 maybe quantifying diversity using

4834
01:57:57,900 --> 01:58:00,460
 

4835
01:57:57,910 --> 01:58:03,990
 entropy and maybe sometimes distances

4836
01:58:00,450 --> 01:58:03,990
 

4837
01:58:00,460 --> 01:58:06,550
 and so on how would probability measure

4838
01:58:03,980 --> 01:58:06,550
 

4839
01:58:03,990 --> 01:58:09,070
 relate so one thing I would say is that

4840
01:58:06,540 --> 01:58:09,070
 

4841
01:58:06,550 --> 01:58:12,940
 that's why I kind of ended by saying we

4842
01:58:09,060 --> 01:58:12,940
 

4843
01:58:09,070 --> 01:58:15,310
 need to establish more formally what we

4844
01:58:12,930 --> 01:58:15,310
 

4845
01:58:12,940 --> 01:58:18,790
 even mean by diversity okay entropy just

4846
01:58:15,300 --> 01:58:18,790
 

4847
01:58:15,310 --> 01:58:20,710
 entropy kind of being does that for you

4848
01:58:18,780 --> 01:58:20,710
 

4849
01:58:18,790 --> 01:58:24,370
 by saying okay how uniform are you and

4850
01:58:20,700 --> 01:58:24,370
 

4851
01:58:20,710 --> 01:58:27,580
 the less uniform you are but one benefit

4852
01:58:24,360 --> 01:58:27,580
 

4853
01:58:24,370 --> 01:58:29,050
 about having this graded or controllable

4854
01:58:27,570 --> 01:58:29,050
 

4855
01:58:27,580 --> 01:58:33,070
 model of diversity is that you could

4856
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:33,070
 

4857
01:58:29,050 --> 01:58:35,650
 learn it for your task rather than just

4858
01:58:33,060 --> 01:58:35,650
 

4859
01:58:33,070 --> 01:58:37,240
 like rather than fixing a prior and then

4860
01:58:35,640 --> 01:58:37,240
 

4861
01:58:35,650 --> 01:58:40,630
 just hammering away

4862
01:58:37,230 --> 01:58:40,630
 

4863
01:58:37,240 --> 01:58:44,800
 you could learn this from data

4864
01:58:40,620 --> 01:58:44,800
 

4865
01:58:40,630 --> 01:58:46,510
 it could be used with or as in

4866
01:58:44,790 --> 01:58:46,510
 

4867
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:49,870
 combination with or as a replacement of

4868
01:58:46,500 --> 01:58:49,870
 

4869
01:58:46,510 --> 01:58:52,960
 entropy based thinking but again it

4870
01:58:49,860 --> 01:58:52,960
 

4871
01:58:49,870 --> 01:58:58,810
 depends on the application yeah thank

4872
01:58:52,950 --> 01:58:58,810
 

4873
01:58:52,960 --> 01:59:00,909
 you hello I want to make it aware that

4874
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:00,909
 

4875
01:58:58,810 --> 01:59:03,370
 this optimization problem you mentioned

4876
01:59:00,899 --> 01:59:03,370
 

4877
01:59:00,909 --> 01:59:06,340
 at the end this issue to actually sample

4878
01:59:03,360 --> 01:59:06,340
 

4879
01:59:03,370 --> 01:59:08,020
 something we applied Polly's enumeration

4880
01:59:06,330 --> 01:59:08,020
 

4881
01:59:06,340 --> 01:59:13,600
 theorem to build a large enough group to

4882
01:59:08,010 --> 01:59:13,600
 

4883
01:59:08,020 --> 01:59:15,370
 do that to study ML risk and we'd love

4884
01:59:13,590 --> 01:59:15,370
 

4885
01:59:13,600 --> 01:59:16,929
 to get your opinion on it on Friday when

4886
01:59:15,360 --> 01:59:16,929
 

4887
01:59:15,370 --> 01:59:18,670
 we talk at the AI workshop for

4888
01:59:16,919 --> 01:59:18,670
 

4889
01:59:16,929 --> 01:59:24,040
 challenges and opportunities and

4890
01:59:18,660 --> 01:59:24,040
 

4891
01:59:18,670 --> 01:59:28,030
 financial crime quick question so you

4892
01:59:24,030 --> 01:59:28,030
 

4893
01:59:24,040 --> 01:59:30,639
 mentioned that the PPP idea can be used

4894
01:59:28,020 --> 01:59:30,639
 

4895
01:59:28,030 --> 01:59:34,420
 to simplify a deep neural network you

4896
01:59:30,629 --> 01:59:34,420
 

4897
01:59:30,639 --> 01:59:36,850
 also mentioned that to trade the TPP you

4898
01:59:34,410 --> 01:59:36,850
 

4899
01:59:34,420 --> 01:59:39,520
 can use it using gradient descents have

4900
01:59:36,840 --> 01:59:39,520
 

4901
01:59:36,850 --> 01:59:41,800
 you thought about like connecting the

4902
01:59:39,510 --> 01:59:41,800
 

4903
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:44,469
 paradigm of TPP because it's unlock

4904
01:59:41,790 --> 01:59:44,469
 

4905
01:59:41,800 --> 01:59:46,600
 determinants making it actually deep and

4906
01:59:44,459 --> 01:59:46,600
 

4907
01:59:44,469 --> 01:59:51,580
 use gradient descent to train for the

4908
01:59:46,590 --> 01:59:51,580
 

4909
01:59:46,600 --> 01:59:55,389
 deep objective so there is a workshop

4910
01:59:51,570 --> 01:59:55,389
 

4911
01:59:51,580 --> 01:59:57,580
 here Friday Saturday which talks about

4912
01:59:55,379 --> 01:59:57,580
 

4913
01:59:55,389 --> 02:00:01,330
 deep determinant two-point processes

4914
01:59:57,570 --> 02:00:01,330
 

4915
01:59:57,580 --> 02:00:04,260
 where they jointly kind of learn deep

4916
02:00:01,320 --> 02:00:04,260
 

4917
02:00:01,330 --> 02:00:07,389
 features in combination with lock that

4918
02:00:04,250 --> 02:00:07,389
 

4919
02:00:04,260 --> 02:00:09,730
 but if you mean something beyond that

4920
02:00:07,379 --> 02:00:09,730
 

4921
02:00:07,389 --> 02:00:15,520
 then I don't know yeah maybe in terms of

4922
02:00:09,720 --> 02:00:15,520
 

4923
02:00:09,730 --> 02:00:17,219
 the objective okay yeah it is possible

4924
02:00:15,510 --> 02:00:17,219
 

4925
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:22,210
 because in the end everything is

4926
02:00:17,209 --> 02:00:22,210
 

4927
02:00:17,219 --> 02:00:27,699
 differentiable the the challenge is how

4928
02:00:22,200 --> 02:00:27,699
 

4929
02:00:22,210 --> 02:00:30,190
 to be scalable because determinants are

4930
