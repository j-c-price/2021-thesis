8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:25,560
PROFESSOR: So we have
organized three lectures.

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,520
And the basic idea
of the lectures

10
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:35,120
are to cover some of
the major current issues

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,940
in nuclear arms control
and nonproliferation.

12
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:47,020
So we have the first lecture
today on India and Pakistan,

13
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:53,170
which is one of the world's
possible flash points,

14
00:00:53,170 --> 00:01:00,380
meaning that there's a path to
a possible nuclear war, which

15
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:05,190
I won't go into Vipin Narang
will certainly spell out

16
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,440
the case.

17
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:12,170
But in my view in trying to
decide what to talk about,

18
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,630
this was a golden opportunity
because Vipin is here,

19
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,700
and he's an expert
on these issues.

20
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:24,440
And I consider this, as I
say, one of the possible flash

21
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:29,860
points in the world, one of
the possible conceivable paths.

22
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:34,610
No path is super likely, if
you want to put it that way.

23
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,740
But the effects of
a nuclear exchange

24
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:43,080
are catastrophic both for the
people who get hit, obviously,

25
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,350
because a nuclear weapon--
I don't have to tell you--

26
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,690
is incredibly destructive.

27
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:53,260
In Hiroshima, something
like 40% of the population

28
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:57,480
was killed, more or less
instantly, burns or blasts.

29
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,890
And probably another
20%, 30% died

30
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:03,480
within a year of radiation.

31
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,250
So in addition,
people have realized

32
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:13,260
that there are severe climate
effects of a nuclear exchange.

33
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,330
One of the things that happens
with all the burning that

34
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:22,800
goes on is that soot is
emitted into the atmosphere.

35
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,950
This is the opposite
of global warming.

36
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,290
This is global cooling.

37
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,410
This is like a
volcanic explosion.

38
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:38,030
And in about 1815, 1816,
there was a volcanic explosion

39
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,460
in Asia.

40
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,380
And there was a
winter without-- there

41
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:47,320
was a summer-- excuse me--
there was a summer without crops

42
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,560
in Europe.

43
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,380
And there was actually
starvation in Europe

44
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,155
due to this explosion.

45
00:02:54,155 --> 00:02:57,170
It was a one time thing.

46
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:03,060
The climate models, for
even a limited nuclear war

47
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,370
in Southeast Asia, show that
this effect would probably

48
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:12,870
last 5 to 10 years
and be global,

49
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,810
from roughly 100
nuclear weapons.

50
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:16,760
So there are papers.

51
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,260
I can give people
references if they want.

52
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,970
There is a paper
in Physics Today

53
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,470
a few years ago about this.

54
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:28,370
But there are many
papers on the subject.

55
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:33,400
So one of the things I want
to say-- so the second lecture

56
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:39,850
will be on proliferation
and uranium enrichment

57
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,140
and the implications.

58
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:46,310
So these lectures will combine
both technology and policy.

59
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,420
And finally, the last
lecture I will give--

60
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:53,320
and it's kind of an overview of
where we stand on nuclear arms

61
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,120
control and
proliferation-- I'll try

62
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,230
to fill in some of the gaps.

63
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,440
I'll talk about the
nonproliferation review that's

64
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,260
coming up at the UN next spring.

65
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:08,033
I'll talk about the outlook
for arms control as I see it.

66
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:14,990
I want to talk a few
minutes to the students

67
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:18,769
because one of the things
that's happened over

68
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:22,660
the last few decades, since
the collapse of the Soviet

69
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:28,560
Union in about 1990,
people stopped worrying

70
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,090
about the bomb, so to speak.

71
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:35,810
Before that, there
was a lot of concern.

72
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:39,080
Students were asked to duck
under their desks and things

73
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,780
like that to protect themselves,
which, of course, was totally

74
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,666
ridiculous.

75
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:50,700
A wooden desk wouldn't do you
much good in a nuclear war

76
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,700
as you can well imagine.

77
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:58,880
It'll just probably knock you
on the head with something.

78
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,504
God knows what it would do.

79
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,510
But the issue has
fallen off the table.

80
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,840
And the thing that
concerns people

81
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,450
more on campus when-- if they
think about global issues,

82
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:17,740
is climate change
and global warming.

83
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:21,750
But this is an issue
which has not gone away.

84
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,950
If anything, the probability
of a nuclear exchange

85
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:31,420
is higher now than a
decade ago unfortunately.

86
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:34,300
And we have not
solved these problems.

87
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:39,170
And there are political
and economic problems.

88
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,130
And I just want
to say a few words

89
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:45,950
about some of the
intellectual problems that

90
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,910
need to be solved.

91
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:50,550
For example, on a
technical basis,

92
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:54,220
there are inspection issues.

93
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:59,850
For example, how do you
inspect whether or not

94
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:05,080
a country is cheating on its
nonproliferation obligations?

95
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,080
How do you look for
weapons production

96
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,680
or enrichment production?

97
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,940
These are very difficult issue,
and they're very difficult

98
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,380
technical issues.

99
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,350
And then there are
issues in which

100
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:23,460
you have to combine
technical issues with policy.

101
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,850
For example, if we're
going to go down

102
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:28,720
to a very small
number of weapons--

103
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,110
as you want to do
for nuclear arms

104
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:35,934
control-- then cheating
with a small number--

105
00:06:35,934 --> 00:06:37,350
particularly if
you're going to go

106
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:43,310
to 0-- cheating with a small
number becomes a bigger issue.

107
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:47,620
So verification issues are
very important, reinventing

108
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,730
the bomb, if you
really want to zero.

109
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:55,020
So there are all kinds
of intellectual issues

110
00:06:55,020 --> 00:07:00,410
that need to be worked out,
both historical, technical,

111
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,950
and political.

112
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:07,370
And there are many opportunities
for research in these areas,

113
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,190
UROP, some theses.

114
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,060
So I just want to
point that out.

115
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:15,470
And there are also positions
in government and NGOs.

116
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:19,860
In the last semester, we
had several major arms

117
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,870
control negotiators
in the US government,

118
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,300
including Rose
Gottemoeller who was

119
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:32,880
the chief negotiator on the US
side for the New START Treaty,

120
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,110
said she was particularly
excited to give a talk at MIT

121
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:41,810
because we really needed a
generation of technically

122
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:45,410
trained people to go into
nuclear arms control.

123
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:50,960
And she made a special plea,
so I want to pass that along.

124
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:58,110
So I'm going to get
to today's lecture.

125
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:04,110
Vipin Narang, he's a professor
at the MIT political science

126
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:07,960
department and the
Security Studies program.

127
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:12,760
He's got a BS and MS in
chemical engineering.

128
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,120
He's got a degree
from Balliol College,

129
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:21,250
where I spent a very
happy semester at Oxford.

130
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:29,517
And he's written extensively
on nonproliferation and issues

131
00:08:29,517 --> 00:08:35,740
of arms control, deterrence,
particularly with respect

132
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,179
to Southeast Asia.

133
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:40,049
And he's got a book
recently published

134
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:43,720
on regional powers and
international conflict.

135
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,677
So Vipin?

136
00:08:45,677 --> 00:08:46,510
VIPIN NARANG: Great.

137
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,051
Thanks Aaron.

138
00:08:47,051 --> 00:08:51,400
Thanks for the kind introduction
and for organizing this.

139
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,880
So as Aaron said,
I'm a professor

140
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,830
at the political
science department,

141
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:58,270
and I work primarily on nuclear
strategy and proliferation.

142
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:02,310
And so what I
thought I'd do today

143
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,480
was talk about--
give an overview

144
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,810
of nuclear proliferation and the
consequences of proliferation

145
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,030
in South Asia, between
India and Pakistan, which

146
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:16,030
is-- as Aaron mentioned-- an
active and ongoing conflict

147
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:19,560
where the threat of
conventional war is persistent.

148
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,920
And there are periodic
militarized crises

149
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:28,260
between India and Pakistan
that put both countries

150
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,290
at a risk of conventional
conflict every now and then.

151
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:35,160
And now that both sides, both
states, have nuclear weapons,

152
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,680
the question is what the
likelihood of escalation

153
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,740
to nuclear level is.

154
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,810
Just as a preview of my
own thinking and writing

155
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:48,010
on the subject, I think India
and Pakistan have so far

156
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:51,470
been lucky in that the
conventional conflict is not

157
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,020
yet escalated to
the nuclear level.

158
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,160
But that's not a foregone
conclusion going forward.

159
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,440
I'll talk a little
bit about that.

160
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,100
And it's one of
the regions where

161
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,130
there is still
active arms racing

162
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,194
between India and Pakistan.

163
00:10:03,194 --> 00:10:04,860
And so I'll talk a
little bit about that

164
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,550
and what the dynamics have been
with the nuclear strategies

165
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,640
and what the effects on the
relationship between India

166
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,400
and Pakistan are.

167
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,010
If you have any questions
at all during lecture,

168
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,461
don't hesitate to stop me.

169
00:10:15,461 --> 00:10:17,210
I know there are diverse
backgrounds here,

170
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:19,410
people from different
departments, undergraduates,

171
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,250
graduate students.

172
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:26,420
I'll go through some basic
theoretical material first.

173
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:30,072
If everybody's OK
with that, we can

174
00:10:30,072 --> 00:10:31,780
move through that
pretty quickly and talk

175
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,417
about India and Pakistan.

176
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:35,750
So as I said, India and
Pakistan are both in the process

177
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:39,560
of building up their
nuclear delivery systems

178
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,190
and their nuclear arsenals.

179
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,670
This is a picture of a
Shaheen missile, which

180
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:46,860
is a Pakistani long-- it's a
medium range ballistic missile

181
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,740
in the Pakistani inventory.

182
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,910
And it's based off of a Chinese
export missile, the M-class

183
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,320
exports.

184
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,490
And both are actively testing
short and long range cruise

185
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:03,420
and ballistic missiles as
their inventories are growing.

186
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,750
And that is one of
the concerns, I think,

187
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,790
as we talk about South Asia.

188
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:10,720
The basic puzzle
though is-- does anyone

189
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,900
know what these
pictures are from.

190
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:17,672
So in November, November
26, 2008-- two weeks

191
00:11:17,672 --> 00:11:19,380
before my wife and I
got married in Delhi

192
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:24,615
actually-- a group nominally
a sponsored and based

193
00:11:24,615 --> 00:11:27,250
in Pakistan, the
Lashkar-e-Taiba,

194
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:31,890
orchestrated a pretty
daring sea-launch attack

195
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:37,760
against Bombay where about a
dozen militants, led by the one

196
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:44,790
survivor from the militant
group Ajmal Kasab pictured here,

197
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:50,410
sieged the Taj Hotel, the
Oberoi Hotel, the Chabad

198
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:57,000
House in Bombay and killed over
170 Indians and Westerners.

199
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,012
And the Indian government
was faced with the decision

200
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:01,220
about how to respond to this.

201
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,200
This was the third provocation
that the Indian government

202
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,400
believe was sponsored
by Pakistan since 1998,

203
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,080
the year in which they
tested nuclear weapons.

204
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,390
And the question
facing Indian leaders,

205
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,200
how do we respond
to a state that

206
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,130
sponsors militant attacks
against our metropolitan--

207
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:22,450
or metropoles,
targets our hotels

208
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:26,497
and our financial center, when
they have nuclear weapons?

209
00:12:26,497 --> 00:12:28,080
And the worry in the
Indian government

210
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,790
was that nuclear weapons had
emboldened Pakistan to sponsor

211
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:33,320
these groups who were
perpetrating more daring

212
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,840
and audacious attacks
against India.

213
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,650
And because Pakistan
had nuclear weapons,

214
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:41,649
India didn't have a
conventional retaliatory option

215
00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:43,190
to punish Pakistan
for these attacks.

216
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,024
And so the Indian
government, for a decade,

217
00:12:45,024 --> 00:12:46,940
has been trying to deal
with what they believe

218
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:52,580
is a policy paralysis about
dealing with a Pakistan that

219
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:56,390
is more willing to support
militant organizations

220
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:59,752
to attack India now that
it has nuclear weapons.

221
00:12:59,752 --> 00:13:00,960
So brief outline of the talk.

222
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,290
I'll talk a little bit about
basic deterrence theory.

223
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:06,530
In political science
and in economics,

224
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:10,385
the core of nuclear strategy,
both in the Cold War and now,

225
00:13:10,385 --> 00:13:11,260
is deterrence theory.

226
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,843
So we'll talk a
little bit about that.

227
00:13:12,843 --> 00:13:14,450
Hopefully, it's not too basic.

228
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,280
I don't need to talk about
the basics of nuclear weapons

229
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,010
to a physics audience.

230
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:18,160
We'll go through
it really briefly,

231
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,060
and some of the choices
states have to make

232
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,059
and how they operationalize
their arsenal, which

233
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:24,700
are really important in the
India and Pakistan context.

234
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,010
I'll talk about the
causes of and the process

235
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:29,930
of nuclearization in South Asia,
how and why India and Pakistan

236
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,542
acquired nuclear weapons.

237
00:13:31,542 --> 00:13:33,250
And then I'll close
with the consequences

238
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,860
and where we are
today, focusing mostly

239
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,260
on the period since 1990.

240
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:42,140
May 1998 is the break point
in the India, Pakistan

241
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,290
nuclear equation.

242
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:47,510
That's when India, led by
the then BJP government,

243
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,010
tested nuclear weapons,
followed three weeks later

244
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,696
by the Pakistani government.

245
00:13:52,696 --> 00:13:54,070
I'll close with
some conclusions.

246
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,280
So basic deterrence theory.

247
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,552
The definition of
deterrence, very simple--

248
00:13:58,552 --> 00:14:00,010
this is a definition
of deterrence.

249
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:03,340
This is all inspired by guys
like Tom Schelling, Herman

250
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,860
Kahn, Albert Wohstetter.

251
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,860
Anybody familiar with
Cold War nuclear strategy,

252
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,068
this will be familiar to you.

253
00:14:08,068 --> 00:14:11,420
So basic deterrence
theory, in any context,

254
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,040
is trying to preserve
the status quo

255
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,680
by threatening unacceptable cost
to an opponent or an adversary

256
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,710
if they do x, some
specified action.

257
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:22,240
So if you do x, I will do y.

258
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,320
And the idea is we
preserve the status quo.

259
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,460
And the idea is that y, the
punishment that you impose

260
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:32,210
on your adversary
opponent, should

261
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:37,250
be greater than the benefits
of them achieving whatever

262
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,380
their objective is,
x, such that they

263
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,590
are deterred from
undertaking the action.

264
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:45,150
Tom Schelling used to love
examples with children.

265
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:48,330
So I have an
18-month-old son myself,

266
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:51,190
and he's starting to
understand things.

267
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:56,310
And as children get
older, deterrence

268
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:59,810
by punishment example
that Tom Schelling used

269
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:04,070
was if your child
does something bad,

270
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,480
you punish them by
sending to their room,

271
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,420
denying them dinner, time out.

272
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:14,640
So there's some punishment
after the fact if they do x.

273
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:21,760
In another example is if you
hit me, I will kill your mother.

274
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:27,230
So there's a punitive aspect
to the deterrence threat

275
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:32,370
such that the punishment exceeds
the benefit of whatever am

276
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:34,950
adversary's objective would be.

277
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:37,470
So in the Cold War, the
deterrence by denial threat

278
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,080
was counterforce.

279
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,179
We were going to disarm and
target their own nuclear forces

280
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:44,970
to make it impossible
for them to carry out

281
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,920
their first strike.

282
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,792
So in a case where
somebody's attacking me,

283
00:15:48,792 --> 00:15:50,250
a deterrence by
denial threat would

284
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,666
be instead of
killing your mother,

285
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:54,290
I cut you're arm off
so you can't attack me.

286
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:57,040
And presumably, the cost
of cutting your arm off,

287
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,042
so you cannot achieve your
objective in the first place,

288
00:16:01,042 --> 00:16:03,000
is sufficient to deter
you from undertaking it.

289
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,280
So a good way to think about
this deterrence by punishment

290
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:10,660
is we will punish you
with such severe cost,

291
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:14,987
after you undertake the
action, such that you'll

292
00:16:14,987 --> 00:16:16,570
have no incentive--
rational incentive

293
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:20,280
to do so verses we will
ratchet up the costs

294
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,760
while you try to achieve the
objective such that you won't

295
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,950
be able to in the first place.

296
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,825
So I think it's an
important distinction when

297
00:16:26,825 --> 00:16:30,040
we think about nuclear strategy
even in the South Asia case.

298
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,540
But in the Cold
War, the distinction

299
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,840
was counterforce
versus countervalue.

300
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,530
So for those familiar with
Cold War nuclear strategy,

301
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:40,060
when we threatened to
target Soviet cities

302
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:43,080
or their economic or
industrial capacity,

303
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,900
that was largely a deterrence
by punishment strategy.

304
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,590
So in the event
that they launched

305
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,380
a conventional or a first
nuclear strike against us,

306
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,844
we would retaliate
against their cities.

307
00:16:52,844 --> 00:16:54,760
The alternative was, and
this was a big debate

308
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,250
early in the Cold War, in a
case of a conventional conflict,

309
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,312
we would launch nuclear weapons
at their nuclear weapons

310
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:03,020
such that they would
not have the ability

311
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:06,630
to launch those weapons at the
United States or its allies.

312
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:12,459
So the deterrence theory has
several basic requirements.

313
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:15,490
We call them the three C's.

314
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:18,030
So you need to
have the capability

315
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:21,010
to impose the threat
that you're promising.

316
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:27,562
So if you're threatening to
destroy an adversary's cities

317
00:17:27,562 --> 00:17:29,020
in the event they
do something, you

318
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,519
need to have the
capability do that.

319
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:33,460
So you need some
explosive capability,

320
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,720
but you also, most importantly,
in the nuclear sense,

321
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,844
need a delivery capability.

322
00:17:36,844 --> 00:17:38,920
You need to be able
to hit their cities.

323
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:43,502
And it needs to be
transparent to the adversary.

324
00:17:43,502 --> 00:17:45,790
It needs to be credible.

325
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:49,500
And this term credibility and
the concept of credibility

326
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,470
is what dogged Cold War strategy
and still dogs nuclear strategy

327
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,910
today.

328
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,730
Credibility is the
hardest part of this.

329
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:02,840
How could you threaten what was
tantamount to mutual suicide

330
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,000
and have it be credible
by your adversary?

331
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,400
So in the event of-- so in
the Cold War, a good example

332
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:17,975
is if the Soviet Union
took West Berlin,

333
00:18:17,975 --> 00:18:20,100
was it really credible that
the United States would

334
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,210
threaten to launch
hundreds of nuclear weapons

335
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:25,640
at Soviet cities?

336
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,837
The Soviet Union
probably didn't think so.

337
00:18:28,837 --> 00:18:30,920
So in a deterrence by
punishment versus deterrence

338
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:35,260
by denial trade off, which one
do you think is more credible?

339
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,530
So in the case where an
attacker is coming at you,

340
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,154
is it more credible
to threaten to kill

341
00:18:39,154 --> 00:18:43,180
their mother in response
or to cut off their arm?

342
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,030
What is an attacker
more likely to believe?

343
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,940
It is disproportionate
to threaten

344
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:52,600
certain punitive action, and
so it is often more credible--

345
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,560
and this is where the trade
off between-- the debate early

346
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:59,230
in the Cold War about deterrence
by punishment versus deterrence

347
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:01,660
by denial turned on the
credibility differences

348
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,717
between the two.

349
00:19:02,717 --> 00:19:05,105
That deterrence by denial
seemed to be more credible.

350
00:19:05,105 --> 00:19:06,730
The adversary is more
likely to believe

351
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,620
that you would try to stop them
from achieving their objectives

352
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,680
than to kill millions
of innocent civilians

353
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,310
that had nothing to do with
the fight in the first place

354
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:16,810
after something had
already happened.

355
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:19,500
And so the United States
ended up threatening both.

356
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:26,650
And part of it was that
the size of the US arsenal

357
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:30,030
made it possible
to threaten both.

358
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,042
But I think there were
many strategists who

359
00:19:32,042 --> 00:19:34,000
believed that the deterrence
by denial missions

360
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,100
were still more credible
to the adversary.

361
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:40,845
But at the heart of deterrence
is this issue of credibility.

362
00:19:40,845 --> 00:19:42,220
And the third C
is communication.

363
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,720
The adversary needs
to know that you

364
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,540
have the capability
and the credibility

365
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:51,990
to threaten the punishment or
deterrence by denial threat

366
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,852
that you make.

367
00:19:53,852 --> 00:19:55,060
So you have to make a threat.

368
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:55,945
IT has to be public.

369
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:58,170
The adversary has to
know what the threat is.

370
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:02,390
The adversary needs
to know what objective

371
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:05,451
you are laying a red line
down for and that you

372
00:20:05,451 --> 00:20:07,700
have the capability to inflict
the punishment that you

373
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,200
threaten.

374
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,030
So there's a huge
amount of transparency

375
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:13,650
that is required for
deterrence to operate.

376
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:16,520
Has anyone seen Dr.
Strangelove, the movie?

377
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,410
What's the problem
with the doomsday

378
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,840
machine in Dr. Strangelove?

379
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,846
There's a great line.

380
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,720
What's the point of a
doomsday machine if you

381
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,850
don't tell anybody about it.

382
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:30,790
The adversary needs to know
that undertaking certain actions

383
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:35,220
will result in some punishment
for deterrence to operate.

384
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:39,190
So nuclear weapons and--
deterrence, as a concept,

385
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,969
pre-dated nuclear weapons.

386
00:20:40,969 --> 00:20:42,510
The concept of
ratcheting up the cost

387
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:46,000
to trying to deter an adversary
predates nuclear weapons

388
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,640
by centuries, since
the dawn of warfare.

389
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,470
But nuclear weapons
fundamentally

390
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:55,690
alter deterrence equations
for several reasons.

391
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:58,040
One, the explosive yields,
and as Aaron mentioned,

392
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,540
even the Hiroshima
bomb, 20 kilotons

393
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,130
could kill 100,000 people.

394
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:10,760
You could kill cities, entire
cities, with a single warhead.

395
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,430
But more than that,
the missile age really

396
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:17,020
changed how deterrence
could operate because, prior

397
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,000
to nuclear weapons,
what was the most

398
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,810
destructive military technology
in States' inventory?

399
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,210
Does anyone know?

400
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:28,140
Before nuclear weapons
in World War II,

401
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,214
how did the United States and
Allies and Germany attack?

402
00:21:31,214 --> 00:21:32,380
AUDIENCE: Strategic bombing.

403
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,570
VIPIN NARANG: Strategic bombing
and fire bombing, right?

404
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:37,153
And the problem was that you had
to send hundreds of airplanes

405
00:21:37,153 --> 00:21:42,350
and sorties into enemy territory
to inflict that kind of damage.

406
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:44,460
So your own pilots and
air force was a risk.

407
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,543
Now, with the missile age,
you can launch warheads

408
00:21:46,543 --> 00:21:49,350
at no risk to your pilots.

409
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,910
The numbers that
you were required

410
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:56,530
to destroy entire cities
were much smaller.

411
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:59,080
So you could ratchet up
the cost really quickly

412
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,810
without incurring much
cost yourself in the way

413
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:05,850
the strategic bombing and fire
bombing required of a state

414
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:08,617
prior to the advent
of the nuclear age.

415
00:22:08,617 --> 00:22:10,950
And one shouldn't underestimate
the psychological impact

416
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:13,320
of an adversary being able
to destroy entire cities

417
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,250
with a single
warhead, from afar,

418
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,850
at very low risk to itself.

419
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:21,930
So nuclear weapons
ratchet up the ease

420
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:24,500
of imposing punishment
in ways that didn't

421
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,970
exist prior to the nuclear age.

422
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:28,553
So nuclear weapons fundamentally
changed deterrence equations.

423
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,970
Is everyone familiar with
the basics of uranium,

424
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:34,053
plutonium nuclear weapons?

425
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:36,060
So I don't need to go
through enriched uranium.

426
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,682
plutonium from reprocessing.

427
00:22:38,682 --> 00:22:41,140
Those are basic fission weapons
and boosted fission weapon.

428
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,660
So what is important,
I think, is

429
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:49,190
most regional powers are
operating-- so India, Pakistan,

430
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:51,215
South Africa when they
had nuclear weapons.

431
00:22:51,215 --> 00:22:52,590
A little known
fact, South Africa

432
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:57,760
had nuclear weapons
from 1979 to about 1991.

433
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,010
Most states start with
fission weapons, move

434
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,175
to boosted fission weapons.

435
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,220
The advanced nuclear
powers have fusion weapons.

436
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,700
Most of the United
States' nuclear inventory

437
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:16,430
is composed of thermo-- these
are thermonuclear weapons.

438
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:19,090
So when you think of
the A-bomb, that's

439
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,590
fission and boosted
fission weapons.

440
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:25,220
The H--bomb are fusion weapons.

441
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:28,100
The United States has extremely
advanced dial up, dial down

442
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,890
yield nuclear weapons.

443
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:32,170
But they're all
thermonuclear weapons

444
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:35,720
where there's a primary that
ignites a fusion secondary.

445
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,360
But most regional powers
are operating here.

446
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:43,030
So North Korea, India, Pakistan.

447
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:46,250
Israel is assumed to have
boosted fission devices.

448
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,369
But it's possible they
have fusion weapons.

449
00:23:48,369 --> 00:23:48,910
It's unknown.

450
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,493
They have never
tested or acknowledged

451
00:23:50,493 --> 00:23:51,525
their nuclear forces.

452
00:23:54,995 --> 00:23:56,786
Well, Britain is
basically an adjunct force

453
00:23:56,786 --> 00:23:57,660
of the United States.

454
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,450
They lease their
weapons from the United

455
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:05,080
States for their tridents, so
those are basically US weapons.

456
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,700
The French have fusion weapons.

457
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:11,330
But India and Pakistan are
operating in boosted fission

458
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:12,000
range.

459
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I mean that's important.

460
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,459
When you can get
to megaton yields,

461
00:24:14,459 --> 00:24:16,541
you are talking about
characteristically different

462
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:17,150
weapons.

463
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:18,525
The number that
would be required

464
00:24:18,525 --> 00:24:20,712
to destroy an entire
city are much lower

465
00:24:20,712 --> 00:24:21,920
once you have fusion weapons.

466
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,650
But obviously, a fission
or boosted fission device

467
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:27,160
could do a lot of
damage as well.

468
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:31,350
But once you have
nuclear warheads,

469
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:33,784
you're only halfway there
in terms of operationalizing

470
00:24:33,784 --> 00:24:34,450
nuclear arsenal.

471
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:35,949
I think this is
often forgotten when

472
00:24:35,949 --> 00:24:38,230
we talk about the
proliferation process.

473
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:40,380
States need more than
just nuclear weapons

474
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,517
and warheads-- functional
and reliable warheads--

475
00:24:42,517 --> 00:24:43,600
to have a nuclear arsenal.

476
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,330
They need delivery
capabilities, right?

477
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:47,560
So the first
question you have is,

478
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,980
how many and what type
of nuclear weapons

479
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:50,892
do I want to have?

480
00:24:50,892 --> 00:24:53,100
India and Pakistan are still
answering this question.

481
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:56,190
It is unclear how much is
enough for India and Pakistan.

482
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:58,060
It is unclear how much
is enough for China.

483
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:03,320
China has about-- it's
estimated in the 200 to 400

484
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:08,170
thermonuclear weapon
range arsenal size.

485
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:11,560
But faced with US
missile defenses,

486
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,550
conventional counterforce
capabilities,

487
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,300
it's unclear how much
is enough for China.

488
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,400
You need to be able to--
a big piece of answering

489
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,730
this question is-- a big
concept in the Cold War

490
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:25,459
was secure second
strike capability.

491
00:25:25,459 --> 00:25:27,000
So we were worried
about-- the United

492
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,860
States was worried about a bolt
out of the blue first strike.

493
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,500
You would lose n
number of weapons.

494
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,830
You needed to have enough that
would be able to survive that

495
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:38,034
not only in terms of numbers,
but in deployment modes,

496
00:25:38,034 --> 00:25:39,950
where they were based
and how they were based,

497
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:43,060
to be able to retaliate
back with certainty

498
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:46,260
against the Soviet Union such
that it deterred the Soviet

499
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,590
from trying to
undertake what is known

500
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,590
as the splendid first
strike in the first place.

501
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:54,070
A splendid first strike being
the ability to fully wipe out

502
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,660
your nuclear arsenal.

503
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:59,070
So secure second strike
capability for states is when

504
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:02,620
they achieve a level of numbers
and deployment modes such that

505
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:06,880
an adversary cannot be confident
that it could fully disarm that

506
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,280
state's nuclear arsenal.

507
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:15,440
Other question is, how
do you deliver them?

508
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,930
So most states
start with aircraft.

509
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:19,230
You've got aircraft.

510
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:21,390
You rig them to carry
nuclear weapons.

511
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:24,855
But what's the problem with
aircrafts as a nuclear delivery

512
00:26:24,855 --> 00:26:25,355
capability?

513
00:26:28,805 --> 00:26:30,138
AUDIENCE: You have to get inside

514
00:26:30,138 --> 00:26:30,950
VIPIN NARANG: Yeah.

515
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:33,280
You have to penetrate
enemy defenses, right?

516
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,196
You're not going to get
there without a fight.

517
00:26:35,196 --> 00:26:38,710
And so it's not the ideal
type of delivery capability.

518
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:41,140
We have strategic bombers
with huge complements

519
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,400
of escort aircraft.

520
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,310
They were not survivable.

521
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:48,820
The advantage to aircraft
is you can recall them.

522
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:51,540
They're piloted so you
can bring them back.

523
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,570
The disadvantage is they still
have to penetrate enemy air

524
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:56,170
forces-- air defenses.

525
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:57,530
Sorry.

526
00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:00,800
So then the United States
and most regional powers

527
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,319
are attracted to ballistic
missiles of various types.

528
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:04,860
Ballistic missiles
have the advantage

529
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:07,840
that you can launch
them from afar.

530
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:13,730
They have different ranges,
liquid fuel, solid fuel.

531
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:17,000
It's not risky for the user.

532
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,522
They can't be recalled though.

533
00:27:19,522 --> 00:27:20,980
But they're different
basing modes,

534
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:23,580
so you can have land-based
ballistic missiles.

535
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:29,072
We have ICBM silos in
Wyoming and North Dakota.

536
00:27:29,072 --> 00:27:31,030
You can have mobile
ballistic missiles on land.

537
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,630
The United States
moved quickly to

538
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:40,610
sea-based ballistic
missiles, SLBMs.

539
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:41,110
Why?

540
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:43,190
Why do you think
sea-based is attractive,

541
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:45,690
at least for the United States?

542
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,820
AUDIENCE: The enemy can't
find them hopefully.

543
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:53,530
VIPIN NARANG: So in theory,
if your subs are quiet enough,

544
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:57,230
they are virtually
100% survivable

545
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:59,070
because they're very
difficult to track

546
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:02,320
if your subs are quiet enough.

547
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,700
And this was something--
there's an assumption

548
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,980
that once a state acquires
a sea-based capability,

549
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:12,360
it has a survivable
second strike force.

550
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,950
That's true probably
in the US case,

551
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:22,060
but other states' SSBNs, the
sea-based ballistic missile

552
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,687
nuclear submarines, are not
quiet as the United States is.

553
00:28:24,687 --> 00:28:27,020
There is increasing evidence
to show that we were pretty

554
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,330
good at tracking Soviet SSBNs.

555
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:32,394
We're pretty good at tracking
subs during the Cold War.

556
00:28:32,394 --> 00:28:34,060
I don't know how much
we track them now.

557
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:37,900
I mean you have to
assume-- Soviet SSBNs,

558
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:41,272
as the later generations
became quieter,

559
00:28:41,272 --> 00:28:43,230
and we're still pretty
good at attracting them.

560
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:46,980
You can imagine first
generation Chinese SSBNs,

561
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,499
Indian SSBNs are
going to be so loud.

562
00:28:49,499 --> 00:28:51,040
Some of them are
not nuclear powered.

563
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,360
They're diesel
powered, which actually

564
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,651
helps with the noise signature.

565
00:28:53,651 --> 00:28:57,825
But it is not
necessarily the case

566
00:28:57,825 --> 00:28:59,950
that all states that acquire
sea-based capabilities

567
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,741
are going to have
survivable second strike.

568
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:06,080
But this is the attraction
of a sea-based force.

569
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,190
A submarine-based
nuclear force is

570
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:11,950
more survivable than land-based
force because land-based force,

571
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:14,200
with all the [INAUDIBLE]
out there now,

572
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,170
you can track-- you know
where launch sites might be,

573
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:19,270
where they may flush
out land-based forces,

574
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:22,900
so then you can target them.

575
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,954
Increasingly, some states
led by the United States

576
00:29:25,954 --> 00:29:28,120
are attracted to cruise
missiles as nuclear delivery

577
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,530
capabilities, Tomahawks.

578
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:36,320
We have a Tomahawk land and
air-based nuclear version.

579
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,820
The French have an air
launched cruise missile,

580
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:43,130
which is a mainstay of their
nuclear force structure.

581
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:46,240
India and Pakistan are also
looking at cruise missiles

582
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,210
because they can-- what's the
advantage of cruise missiles?

583
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:55,689
What's the worry now
with ballistic missiles?

584
00:29:55,689 --> 00:29:57,230
AUDIENCE: They might
shoot them down.

585
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:59,230
VIPIN NARANG: So missile
defenses and the advent

586
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,820
of missile defenses is starting
to threaten the survivability

587
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:04,130
of ballistic
missiles, so one shift

588
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:09,060
is to cruise
missiles, which fly--

589
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:12,420
they have lower altitudes.

590
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,410
They can be more
easily controlled,

591
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:17,037
so there's more
recallability, I think,

592
00:30:17,037 --> 00:30:19,120
with cruise missiles than
with ballistic missiles,

593
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,828
but primarily to defeat
missile defenses.

594
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:25,140
Third question is, how
do you manage them?

595
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:28,920
Some states put their nuclear
forces under military control.

596
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,996
Some states put them under
very firm civilian control.

597
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,870
This is a question the
United States wrestled

598
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:35,510
with during the Cold War.

599
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:40,300
Initially, the Department
of Atomic Energy

600
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,744
managed the nuclear pits
in the United States.

601
00:30:42,744 --> 00:30:44,410
It was under very
firm civilian control.

602
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:47,530
And then as it became clear
that the United States would

603
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:51,960
have to delegate some actual
nuclear forces to the Army

604
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:56,390
in Western Europe for
tactical nuclear weapons,

605
00:30:56,390 --> 00:31:01,630
the US arsenal came under
military management,

606
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:04,890
but still under
civilian authority.

607
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:07,040
Other states like
Pakistan are completely

608
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,414
under military
control, and we'll

609
00:31:08,414 --> 00:31:11,070
talk a little bit about that.

610
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:14,100
But fundamentally, the
question that regional powers

611
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,920
in particular have
to face, in ways

612
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,920
that the superpowers
didn't as much as,

613
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:21,270
is what are you trying to
deter with nuclear weapons?

614
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:23,260
Why are you attracting
nuclear weapons,

615
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:26,370
and what are you using
them for in your larger

616
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:28,450
strategic policy?

617
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:30,570
So some states need
nuclear weapons

618
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:33,150
just to deter nuclear
use against them.

619
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:37,320
States, like China for example,
which have huge geographies,

620
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:41,210
3 million men under arms,
defense in depth strategy

621
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:44,230
aren't really facing
conventional threats

622
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:48,380
on land the way that the US and
Soviet Union were facing off

623
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,870
in Western Europe.

624
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:53,019
So China and India
both primarily

625
00:31:53,019 --> 00:31:55,310
have nuclear weapons to deter
nuclear use against them.

626
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:57,030
So you are worried about
a nuclear armed adversary.

627
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:59,620
You don't want your adversary
to have nuclear weapons

628
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,732
and you not have the
ability to retaliate.

629
00:32:01,732 --> 00:32:03,190
You're really using
nuclear weapons

630
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:04,900
to deter nuclear
use against you.

631
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:08,550
You can then rely on what we
call an assured retaliation

632
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:09,980
strategy.

633
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,352
You just need to be
able survive what

634
00:32:12,352 --> 00:32:13,810
might be a first
strike against you

635
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:15,226
and retaliate with
nuclear weapons

636
00:32:15,226 --> 00:32:18,680
against your adversaries
population centers.

637
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,200
This is your classic deterrence
by punishment strategy.

638
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,232
Nuclear weapons don't
need to be on high alert.

639
00:32:25,232 --> 00:32:26,940
Retaliation doesn't
need to be immediate.

640
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:30,452
It just needs to
be certain, and you

641
00:32:30,452 --> 00:32:31,910
don't need tactical
nuclear weapons

642
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:35,820
because you're not using nuclear
weapons on conventional forces

643
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,000
that might be attacking you.

644
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,380
So this allows for much
more centralized, recessed

645
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:43,860
management if that's your aim.

646
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:47,060
If your aim is to deter
conventional aggression--

647
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:50,290
this was the US and NATO
during the Cold War.

648
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:53,080
We had conventional
inferiority in Europe.

649
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:57,130
In order to offset the
conventional capability

650
00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:02,050
of the Warsaw Pact
and the Soviet Union,

651
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:04,270
the United States
needed nuclear weapons--

652
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:06,140
the threat of tactical
nuclear weapons

653
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:09,379
to offset that differential.

654
00:33:09,379 --> 00:33:11,670
And we needed to threaten to
use nuclear weapons first.

655
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:14,314
If Warsaw Pact nuclear
conventional forces

656
00:33:14,314 --> 00:33:15,730
came crashing in
a Western Europe,

657
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:17,781
the United States
very explicitly

658
00:33:17,781 --> 00:33:19,530
threatened to use
tactical nuclear weapons

659
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:23,860
against advancing
Warsaw Pact forces.

660
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,540
Unlike in the assured
retaliation case,

661
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,220
you can say, look, I have
a no first use policy.

662
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,178
I won't use nuclear
weapons unless you use them

663
00:33:29,178 --> 00:33:34,370
against me, primarily strategic
weapons, compared to here

664
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:38,280
you have a very forward,
aggressive tactical nuclear

665
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,034
weapons capability
where you have

666
00:33:40,034 --> 00:33:41,700
to threaten to use
nuclear weapons first

667
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,074
right because you're trying
to deter conventional attacks

668
00:33:44,074 --> 00:33:46,040
against you.

669
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,890
And it looks like a
denial and punishment

670
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:49,605
mission at the same time.

671
00:33:49,605 --> 00:33:51,980
And now regional powers are
faced with the same question.

672
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:54,575
Now, can anyone guess
where India falls?

673
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,620
Did I say it already?

674
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,850
Yeah.

675
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:02,460
Assured retaliation.

676
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,695
They have conventional
superiority against Pakistan.

677
00:34:04,695 --> 00:34:06,278
They're not really
worried about China

678
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:08,780
invading India and marching
all the way to Delhi.

679
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,670
They're primarily trying
to deter nuclear use

680
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:15,269
against its own cities.

681
00:34:15,269 --> 00:34:16,310
Where does Pakistan fall?

682
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:17,949
What is Pakistan worried about?

683
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:21,429
So Pakistan is primarily worried
about Indian conventional

684
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:22,420
superiority.

685
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:25,500
And having been at the
receiving end of dismemberment

686
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,300
from India in 1971,
which I'll talk about,

687
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,909
Pakistan has
operationalized a posture

688
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:34,830
that is very aggressive, very
oriented towards battlefield

689
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:37,530
nuclear weapons against any
conventional forces that might

690
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:39,260
cross the international border.

691
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:43,310
And so they have a first use--
I call it asymmetric escalation

692
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,075
doctrine.

693
00:34:44,075 --> 00:34:46,116
They threaten to escalate
a conventional conflict

694
00:34:46,116 --> 00:34:52,520
to the nuclear very quickly
because-- or earlier than India

695
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,570
would-- before any other
nuclear weapons are used

696
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:59,760
because they're worried about
Indian conventional superiority

697
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,920
against it.

698
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,590
Pakistan actually started
its nuclear program

699
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:08,720
before India tested the
so-called PNE in 1974

700
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,720
because on the
heels of the 1974--

701
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,160
I'll talk about this,
actually, right now.

702
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,190
So India security environment,
historically, so it

703
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:18,970
has the 1962 war
with China in which

704
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:27,527
its conventional performance
shocked even the Indian army

705
00:35:27,527 --> 00:35:28,610
and the Indian leadership.

706
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:35,100
The Chinese performed so
much better than the Indians

707
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,810
in the '62 war, and India
decisively lost the '62 war.

708
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:43,260
Two years later, China
tested its nuclear weapons.

709
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:49,530
So the Indian military program
gets its motivation, initially,

710
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:54,230
from its experiences in
'62 and '64 with China.

711
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:59,760
And to avoid nuclear coercion
in the future against China,

712
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,870
India hedges under
the Nehru years

713
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:05,940
and then the subsequent
leadership under Indira Ghandi.

714
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:09,320
It does also have these
persistent wars with Pakistan.

715
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,390
But it has conventional
superiority,

716
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:14,730
and there was really
never any talk

717
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:17,720
about needing nuclear weapons
to deter the Pakistanis.

718
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,450
So India had a civilian
nuclear program.

719
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:23,860
It got a CANDU reactor Canada.

720
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:27,590
Some of the heavy waters was
supplied by the United States,

721
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:31,570
and 54 reprocessing
facilities in '64.

722
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:35,870
And then in 1974,
Indira Ghandi authorizes

723
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:38,480
what's known at the time-- under
the Atoms for Peace program,

724
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,570
there was a category known as
a Peaceful Nuclear Explosion,

725
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:49,230
which was-- I mean there
are legitimate uses, it

726
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:51,710
was believed at the
time, for nuclear.

727
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,900
Like, if you needed to
clear large swaths of land

728
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,190
for dams for example.

729
00:36:56,190 --> 00:37:01,654
And India had some
potential uses for this,

730
00:37:01,654 --> 00:37:03,070
but it didn't
really fool-- I mean

731
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:05,486
a peaceful nuclear explosion
is still a nuclear explosion.

732
00:37:05,486 --> 00:37:06,970
It wasn't, however, a warhead.

733
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:09,300
I mean this thing
was a rickety--

734
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,000
I think was it was eight
meters in diameter device.

735
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,211
I mean it was a hulking,
unstable, rickety fission

736
00:37:18,211 --> 00:37:19,710
device that they
tested in 1974-- it

737
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,610
wasn't suitable for
a military program.

738
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:22,850
It wasn't miniaturized.

739
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:28,600
It didn't have-- it was
even suitable for delivery

740
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,280
by aircraft.

741
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,010
You'd have to throw it out
the back of a cargo plane.

742
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:35,960
I mean it still gave
them, certainly,

743
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:44,610
the physics of being able
to sustain fission and have

744
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:45,770
spherical compression.

745
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:48,330
All of that was-- and it
was a plutonium device,

746
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:51,630
so it wasn't trivial.

747
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:55,210
But it wasn't a nuclear
weapon in the sense of the way

748
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:56,550
that we think of.

749
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:59,000
So a lot of work was still
yet to be done after 1974,

750
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,790
but it demonstrated that Indian
scientists had the ability

751
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:04,797
to at least design
rudimentary nuclear weapons.

752
00:38:04,797 --> 00:38:06,380
There are several
explanations for why

753
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,840
it tested in '74, as
a general security

754
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,160
environment-- I talked about
China-- persistent wars

755
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:11,743
with Pakistan.

756
00:38:11,743 --> 00:38:15,630
They had just won the 1970
war with Pakistan-- 1971 war

757
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,696
with Pakistan, which
split Pakistan in two.

758
00:38:17,696 --> 00:38:18,570
I'll talk about that.

759
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:21,340
That was the real motivation
for the Pakistani program.

760
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,230
But the real explanation
is a combination

761
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:25,750
of domestic politics
and the power

762
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,210
of the scientists in India.

763
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:30,330
So Indira Ghandi was
facing a potential series

764
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:33,120
of losses in state governments.

765
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:36,350
She wanted a big win.

766
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:41,000
There were several very
prominent Indian physicists

767
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:48,200
and engineers who promised a big
boost in her electoral fortunes

768
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,777
if she tested a nuclear
weapon, and they really

769
00:38:50,777 --> 00:38:52,610
wanted to test a nuclear
weapon because they

770
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:53,526
had bee working on it.

771
00:38:53,526 --> 00:38:55,740
Scientists like to test the
things that they work on.

772
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:58,740
And they had been doing this
persistently for several years.

773
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:01,910
And she then found her
opportunity in 1974

774
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:04,250
when, right before a
series of state elections,

775
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,290
she authorized the test.

776
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,920
Empirically, the
test didn't actually

777
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:14,400
help her that much electorally,
but there was a belief

778
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,712
that it might.

779
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:17,920
And so that was some of the
motivations for the test.

780
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,310
From 1974 until about
1989, for about 15 years,

781
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:25,770
India's nuclear program went
into effective dormancy.

782
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:27,480
There was no high
level authorization

783
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:31,890
from Indira Gandhi, or her son
who later became prime minister

784
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:35,800
after her assassination in
1984, for the militarization

785
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,150
of the program.

786
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:42,130
So India's scientists
worked on some of the--

787
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:45,760
did some of the theoretical
work for miniaturization,

788
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,930
getting India in a place
where if it had to militarize

789
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:50,270
a program, it could.

790
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:56,740
But there was no actual physical
worked done on that after 1974.

791
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:59,610
Pakistan faced a somewhat
different security environment.

792
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:02,610
So where as India lost
the '62 war and then

793
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:05,130
faced China's nuclear test--
but never really faced

794
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:07,430
the threat of a massive
conventional invasion

795
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:09,470
from China, really
wanting nuclear weapons

796
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:12,510
to deter the Chinese
nuclear threat, not

797
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,230
the Chinese
conventional threat--

798
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:17,750
Pakistan was really
scarred by the 1971 war.

799
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:26,010
So the 1971 war was the
war in which East Pakistan

800
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:27,590
was birthed into Bangladesh.

801
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:29,750
So there was a refugee
crisis the West Pakistan

802
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:33,410
and East-- so Pakistan
at birth, in 1947,

803
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:36,790
was split non-contiguous
with India in the middle.

804
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:38,130
You had East and West Pakistan.

805
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:40,065
West Pakistan was
dominated by Punjab.

806
00:40:40,065 --> 00:40:43,150
East Pakistan was dominated
by Bangladeshis-- Bengalis.

807
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,780
Sorry.

808
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:45,670
Later Bangladeshis.

809
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:46,490
Bengalis.

810
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:51,020
So there was ethnic tension
between Punjabis and Bengalis.

811
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:53,390
The Punjabis dominated
the politics of Pakistan.

812
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:55,640
Bengalis felt like
they were second class

813
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,550
citizens in Pakistan.

814
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:58,450
That created political tension.

815
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:00,870
And there was an
uprising in 1971.

816
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:03,810
India intervened on
behalf of the Bengalis

817
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:06,370
to split East Pakistan
off of a West Pakistan.

818
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:10,090
Now, if you're India, this is a
huge strategic victory, right?

819
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:13,950
You had two flanks of
Pakistan surrounding you,

820
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:19,650
and you were able to make
them two independent countries

821
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:25,090
with the benefit that you helped
birth Bangladesh from Pakistan.

822
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:29,590
So it's not like
they would be allies

823
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:31,730
against you in a conflict.

824
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:35,080
So strategically this worked
out pretty well for India.

825
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:38,060
But for West Pakistan,
now present day Pakistan,

826
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:40,420
this was a pretty scary moment.

827
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:45,580
Your east wing is
amputated, and it was

828
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,360
at the hands of the Indians.

829
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,830
So as early as 1965,
when it became clear

830
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:54,239
that India might look at nuclear
weapons because of China,

831
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:56,780
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was
the prime minister that ended up

832
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:00,780
authorizing the program
through the 1970s,

833
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:03,032
said "we will eat grass or
leaves or even go hungry,

834
00:42:03,032 --> 00:42:04,490
but we will get a
bomb of our own."

835
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:05,739
It's one of his famous quotes.

836
00:42:05,739 --> 00:42:08,920
Remember, this was
said as early as 1965.

837
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:12,030
But after the 1971
war-- in January 1972,

838
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:16,380
so right after 1971 war, Bhutto
authorizes the nuclear weapons

839
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:19,450
program with express intent of
a militarized nuclear weapons

840
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:22,520
program to deter Indian
conventional power.

841
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:29,460
So it wasn't because of the
Indian PNE, which was 1974.

842
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:31,760
Pakistan's nuclear
weapons program

843
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,830
predates India's 1974 test.

844
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:37,530
The real motivation
was the 1971 war.

845
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:40,040
Pakistan could not suffer
the conventional defeat

846
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:44,550
at the hands of
the Indians again.

847
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:48,080
And so Pakistan's nuclear
program was triggered.

848
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:52,780
For a state that was essentially
desperate for nuclear weapons,

849
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:55,030
Pakistan tried all
possible avenues.

850
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:58,985
So you had the uranium pathway,
which was led by AQ Khan.

851
00:42:58,985 --> 00:43:00,360
Everyone's familiar
with AQ Khan?

852
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,670
Yes we Khan?

853
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:03,880
Horrible, horrible joke.

854
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,640
I apologize.

855
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,130
So he essentially stole
the URENCO designs.

856
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:09,850
URENCO is a European consortium.

857
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:14,480
He stole it from
the Netherlands.

858
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,520
He worked at URENCO.

859
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,186
From the inside, he
stole the blueprints

860
00:43:17,186 --> 00:43:20,210
for what ended up being the P1.

861
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:22,390
And then he modified it
later to be P2 designs.

862
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:24,170
So he stole the
URENCO centrifuge

863
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:29,207
designs from URENCO itself
where he was an employee.

864
00:43:29,207 --> 00:43:30,790
He went back to
Bhutto and said, look,

865
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:35,590
I can deliver a nuclear
weapons program.

866
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:42,270
And they set up cascades
of the P1s at Kahuta,

867
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:45,180
which Pakistan would
deny through the 1980s,

868
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,510
was a uranium
enrichment facility.

869
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:51,640
The then president,
General Zia, referred to it

870
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:55,300
as a goat shed repeatedly in
interactions with the United

871
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,230
States.

872
00:43:57,230 --> 00:44:03,160
The problem was what
happened in 1979?

873
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,866
Charlie Wilson's War, anyone?

874
00:44:05,866 --> 00:44:06,850
AUDIENCE: Iran.

875
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:08,100
VIPIN NARANG: Well, also Iran.

876
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:10,025
OK, that's true.

877
00:44:10,025 --> 00:44:12,876
You had the Iran Hostage Crisis
and the revolution in Iran.

878
00:44:12,876 --> 00:44:16,947
But you also had what
else, December 1979?

879
00:44:16,947 --> 00:44:18,030
AUDIENCE: Soviet invasion.

880
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,730
VIPIN NARANG: Yes,
Christmas invasion.

881
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:22,810
So the Soviets
invade Afghanistan.

882
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:27,080
And all of a sudden, Pakistan
is America's-- one of the most

883
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:30,930
useful countries in the
world for the United States

884
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:33,590
because the United
States decides to supply

885
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:35,950
the mujahideen in Afghanistan
to fight the Soviets.

886
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:37,810
How do you get supplies
to the mujahideen?

887
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:39,520
You have to route
them through Pakistan.

888
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,420
That's when the relationship
between Pakistan and the United

889
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:46,320
States flourished because
we really had no option.

890
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,840
History doesn't repeat
itself, but it rhymes.

891
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:51,210
We did the exact same
thing in the 2000s.

892
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:55,880
And when we were at
war in Afghanistan,

893
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:59,790
we needed the ground lines of
communication through Pakistan.

894
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:05,487
And the relationship between the
ISI and the CIA in the 1980s,

895
00:45:05,487 --> 00:45:07,070
because of the US
role in Afghanistan,

896
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:13,270
became-- what's the right
word for it-- blossomed.

897
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:16,340
But there was always tension
in that relationship.

898
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:23,570
But due to US nonproliferation
legislation in Congress,

899
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:26,720
the United States would
have been obligated

900
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,750
to sanction Pakistan
and cut off all aid

901
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:32,934
if Pakistan were to
assemble a nuclear weapon.

902
00:45:32,934 --> 00:45:34,350
Remember, Pakistan
and India never

903
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:36,870
signed the Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty.

904
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:40,660
US legislation required
that a state that was not

905
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:43,070
a member of the
Non-Proliferation Treaty

906
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:48,950
found with nuclear weapons--
or who had nuclear weapons,

907
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:51,740
would face immediate
sanctions cut off of US aid.

908
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:54,700
But that threatened US
operations in Afghanistan,

909
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,180
so that couldn't happen.

910
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:59,470
So there was a lot of tension
between the nonproliferation

911
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:02,690
hawks at the state
department and the executive.

912
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:07,090
So the Reagan administration
went to great lengths

913
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:10,430
to play fast and loose
on where Pakistan

914
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:12,580
was with its nuclear program.

915
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:16,230
Everybody knew that Pakistan
had a nuclear weapons program.

916
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:18,930
But the wording of the
language of the legislation

917
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:22,930
required-- and it
later embodied in what

918
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:24,490
was known as the
Solarz Amendment

919
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:26,560
that the US presence
certify that Pakistan

920
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,610
doesn't have nuclear weapons.

921
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:32,920
So as long as the
executive-- and the executive

922
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:37,030
defined nuclear weapons as the
assembly of a nuclear weapon.

923
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:40,760
So as long as Pakistan
did not cross that line,

924
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,640
the executive could
certify that Pakistan

925
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,000
was a non-nuclear weapon state.

926
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,140
And therefore, the aid and the
relationship between the US

927
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,340
and Pakistan could continue.

928
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:54,630
AUDIENCE: When you say
Pakistan, is this so east

929
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:56,830
and west are actually
separate countries?

930
00:46:56,830 --> 00:46:57,890
VIPIN NARANG: So
Bangladesh, at this point,

931
00:46:57,890 --> 00:47:00,431
is an independent country after
1970-- so this is west-- this

932
00:47:00,431 --> 00:47:02,460
is Pakistan, Pakistan,
present day Pakistan.

933
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:03,860
And this is with Zia.

934
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:05,960
Zia is the president general.

935
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:11,740
He executed Bhutto in 1979
I think also, '77 or '79.

936
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:17,240
And he's the present of
Pakistan during the 1980s.

937
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:20,070
And we'll get through
the-- there's a slow march

938
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:22,250
to nuclearization
So '83, there's

939
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:25,100
some Chinese assistance to
the Pakistani nuclear program.

940
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:28,530
In fact, on precedent, I think,
in the annals of proliferation,

941
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:33,070
China transferred--
is now, I think, out

942
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:38,177
in declassified documents,
the United States believes,

943
00:47:38,177 --> 00:47:40,510
and i think Pakistan has
admitted, that they received 50

944
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:44,610
kilograms of HEU from Pakistan.

945
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:49,230
That's effectively two
bombs worth of HEU.

946
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:54,110
Assuming 25 kilograms
a per bomb--

947
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:57,900
two bombs worth of HEU
from China plus the design

948
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:04,300
for uranium core warhead,
known as CHIC-4 design.

949
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:06,800
It was the fourth test in
the Chinese test series.

950
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,510
So that's 1983.

951
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:11,370
By 1986, the US is
essentially convinced

952
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:13,555
that Pakistan is a
nuclear capable state.

953
00:48:13,555 --> 00:48:14,930
But remember, it
had it certified

954
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:17,150
as a non-nuclear weapons state.

955
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:19,410
So they were two
screwdriver turns away,

956
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:21,660
you could certify them as a
non-nuclear weapons state.

957
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:25,420
And the executive
continued to do that.

958
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:27,269
In March 1987, Zia
complicates all

959
00:48:27,269 --> 00:48:29,560
of this when he claims that
Pakistan has the capability

960
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:32,910
to make a bomb in Time magazine.

961
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:36,790
So all of the nonproliferation
hawks go nuts.

962
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:38,950
Here, you have the
president of Pakistan

963
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:43,810
saying to Time magazine that
Pakistan-- he literally said,

964
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:46,360
you could write Pakistan has
the capability to make a bomb,

965
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,360
and they did.

966
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:52,450
And it was then that
congressman Stephen Solarz

967
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:54,854
passed the Solarz
amendment where

968
00:48:54,854 --> 00:48:56,770
the president had to
actually certify Pakistan

969
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:57,670
not a nuclear weapon state.

970
00:48:57,670 --> 00:48:59,290
But the language he
put in there made

971
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:03,310
it easier for the president
to be able to say that and not

972
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:07,404
be lying because the language
is basically nuclear device.

973
00:49:07,404 --> 00:49:08,820
So if the device
wasn't assembled,

974
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:12,750
the executive could legitimately
claim that Pakistan did not

975
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:14,550
have a nuclear weapon.

976
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:16,360
Even though it had
the pit over there,

977
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:20,480
the explosive package over
here, the assembly over here,

978
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,210
but it would all be on
three sides of the room.

979
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:25,670
But you could certify
that it wasn't assembled,

980
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:29,250
so it wasn't a nuclear weapon.

981
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:32,380
And so by 1988, the
nonproliferation hawks

982
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:35,930
had given up, and Solarz
quipped that it had a Saturday

983
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:37,760
night special capability.

984
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:42,610
It may not be elegant,
but it'll do the job.

985
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:46,410
And one of the advantages to
the Pakistani nuclear weapons

986
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:47,980
program was, given
the fact that they

987
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:50,550
had a tested design
from the Chinese,

988
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:52,810
they conducted a series of
cold tests in the 1980s.

989
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:55,060
But they didn't have to
necessarily conduct a hot test

990
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:57,390
to know that their
weapons would work,

991
00:49:57,390 --> 00:50:00,070
unlike the Indians who
were indigenously designing

992
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:02,202
their plutonium devices.

993
00:50:02,202 --> 00:50:04,660
So by the late 1980s, Pakistan
is a nuclear weapons capable

994
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:05,160
state.

995
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:11,010
In fact, the War in Afghanistan
ends around 1989, 1990.

996
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:13,810
President George H
W Bush is president.

997
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:19,210
And as soon as the US stops--
as soon as the Cold War

998
00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:22,980
collapse-- sorry-- the
Soviet Union collapses,

999
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:25,640
President H W Bush
refuse to certify

1000
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,640
Pakistan as a non-nuclear
weapon states anymore.

1001
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,955
AUDIENCE: You talk
a out cold test.

1002
00:50:29,955 --> 00:50:31,394
What constitutes a cold test?

1003
00:50:31,394 --> 00:50:33,810
VIPIN NARANG: A cold test is
without the fissile material.

1004
00:50:33,810 --> 00:50:35,160
So you--

1005
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,760
AUDIENCE: Do they really
know that it works?

1006
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,450
VIPIN NARANG:
Especially in this case,

1007
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:41,477
it's a spherical compression.

1008
00:50:41,477 --> 00:50:44,060
So they wanted to, as they were
testing the explosive charges,

1009
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:46,965
make sure they get a
uniform compression wave.

1010
00:50:46,965 --> 00:50:49,090
Because they weren't using--
it's a uranium device,

1011
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:51,790
but they weren't
designing contact devices.

1012
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:53,205
It was still an implosion.

1013
00:50:53,205 --> 00:50:55,610
It was a uranium
implosion device.

1014
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:59,190
And so you could do a cold test
without the fissile material

1015
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:01,230
to make sure that you had
a uniform compression.

1016
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:04,842
So you can do a
sufficient number of tests

1017
00:51:04,842 --> 00:51:06,050
without the fissile material.

1018
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:12,400
And since the design itself
was tested in a hot test,

1019
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,210
I think the Pakistanis
were quite confident

1020
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:17,687
that once they had enough
fissile material in the design,

1021
00:51:17,687 --> 00:51:18,270
it would work.

1022
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:25,080
So in this period, remember,
India is in dormancy.

1023
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:30,920
But there's a-- in response to
Zia's claim in Time magazine

1024
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:35,820
and several other statements,
India brings its program out

1025
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:37,740
of dormancy in
response, actually,

1026
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:38,720
to Pakistan's program.

1027
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,630
So there's a narrative--
the conventional wisdom

1028
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:45,740
is that India's
nuclear program beget

1029
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:47,710
Pakistan's nuclear program.

1030
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:49,110
But it's the other way around.

1031
00:51:49,110 --> 00:51:50,710
So Pakistan's
program is triggered

1032
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:52,920
by Indian conventional power.

1033
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:56,780
India has this rudimentary
nuclear hedging program

1034
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,300
in the 1970s.

1035
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:01,030
It was only when
Pakistan claimed publicly

1036
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:04,010
that it had a nuclear weapons
capability that India brings

1037
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:05,620
its program out of dormancy.

1038
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:09,550
So it was only in 1988, 1989--
it was actually winter of 1989.

1039
00:52:09,550 --> 00:52:11,780
Then Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi orders

1040
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:15,170
work on weaponization,
miniaturization, production

1041
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:17,940
line, all the things you need
to have a military program.

1042
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:20,470
And India only is starting
then, at that point, racing

1043
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:21,940
to develop delivery capability.

1044
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:24,380
So they had indigenous
missiles, the Agni

1045
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:26,170
and the Prithvi missile.

1046
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:30,479
And so India was playing
from behind in this period.

1047
00:52:30,479 --> 00:52:32,520
So it would take India
another four or five years

1048
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:35,210
before they would have
a militarized program

1049
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:38,480
that they could test.

1050
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,540
Once they reached
that point, there

1051
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:42,030
were several aborted tests.

1052
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:46,180
1995, Prime Minister Rao
of the Congress Party,

1053
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:47,710
he is on the brink of tests.

1054
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:50,090
And the US Ambassador,
Frank Wisner

1055
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:53,912
goes to Prime
Minister Rao and says,

1056
00:52:53,912 --> 00:52:55,120
we know you're about to test.

1057
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:56,142
Don't do it.

1058
00:52:56,142 --> 00:52:58,100
The weight of American
sanctions will kill you,

1059
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:01,151
and Rao backs off.

1060
00:53:01,151 --> 00:53:04,310
A couple months later, the
BJP, which is the opposition

1061
00:53:04,310 --> 00:53:06,700
party-- the main opposition
party at the time,

1062
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:08,222
when's office for
the first time.

1063
00:53:08,222 --> 00:53:09,680
They're in office
for only 13 days,

1064
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,305
so they have to pull
back from the test

1065
00:53:11,305 --> 00:53:13,270
that they were
planning to conduct.

1066
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:15,060
When they return to
power in May 1998,

1067
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:16,930
the BJP, in its
manifesto, says it's

1068
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:19,100
going to test nuclear weapons.

1069
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:20,850
Yet the CIA claims it
was caught off guard

1070
00:53:20,850 --> 00:53:22,475
when they came back
to power after they

1071
00:53:22,475 --> 00:53:24,420
had ordered tests in 1996.

1072
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:26,690
Everyone claims that the
CIA was caught off guard

1073
00:53:26,690 --> 00:53:28,550
by the May 1998 test.

1074
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:31,595
But the BJP had said it publicly
that if they came into office,

1075
00:53:31,595 --> 00:53:33,780
they were going to test
nuclear weapons again.

1076
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:36,210
And they did take
steps to camouflage

1077
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:38,450
the activity in the test sites.

1078
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:41,730
But as soon as they come back
to office, two months after they

1079
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:46,457
win office in a
permanent majority,

1080
00:53:46,457 --> 00:53:47,540
they test nuclear weapons.

1081
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:50,830
It was five fission devices.

1082
00:53:50,830 --> 00:53:52,330
They cited everything
under the sun,

1083
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:53,480
but primarily,
China's the reason

1084
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,646
for testing nuclear weapons.

1085
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,674
And then the question
was, how does India, now

1086
00:53:59,674 --> 00:54:01,340
that they overly
tested nuclear weapons,

1087
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:03,120
operationalize its
nuclear capabilities?

1088
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:07,250
As I mentioned before, India has
an assured retaliation posture.

1089
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:08,800
So it tested nuclear
weapons in 1998,

1090
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,210
and then the question is, how
do we manage these things?

1091
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:14,650
India very quickly decided to
have a no first use policy.

1092
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:17,240
And they were going to have
a very assertive management

1093
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:20,460
of their nuclear forces and
rely on an assured retaliation

1094
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:22,960
capability, so no tactical
nuclear weapons, just

1095
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,160
strategic weapons.

1096
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,680
The capability is
under civilian custody,

1097
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,960
and the aim of their doctrine
is to deter nuclear use

1098
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,789
against Indian
population centers.

1099
00:54:32,789 --> 00:54:34,580
So it's a deterrent by
punishment strategy.

1100
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:38,794
And they have long range
ballistic missiles.

1101
00:54:38,794 --> 00:54:40,210
They had some
aircraft capability,

1102
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:42,900
but they're primarily moving
a missile capability now.

1103
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:46,300
And they have very
recessed posture,

1104
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:48,490
very few weapons on alert.

1105
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:52,336
Most of the arsenal is actually
disassembled during peace time.

1106
00:54:52,336 --> 00:54:54,210
Some subset is at higher
states of readiness,

1107
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:58,129
but it's primarily-- it
would take several steps

1108
00:54:58,129 --> 00:55:00,170
up the alert ladder before
India is in a position

1109
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:01,128
to use nuclear weapons.

1110
00:55:01,128 --> 00:55:05,160
So they're not on
hair trigger alert

1111
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,970
as American and
Soviet weapons were.

1112
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:13,020
Pakistan, on the other hand--
so it tests shortly after India.

1113
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:15,660
They have moved away
from uranium enrichment

1114
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:16,457
to plutonium.

1115
00:55:16,457 --> 00:55:18,915
For the physicists here, what's
the advantage of plutonium?

1116
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,712
Plutonium weapons.

1117
00:55:25,712 --> 00:55:27,107
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1118
00:55:27,107 --> 00:55:27,940
VIPIN NARANG: Right.

1119
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:29,773
So the yield-to-weight
ratio is much better.

1120
00:55:29,773 --> 00:55:34,190
So if you want battlefield
nuclear weapons or higher yield

1121
00:55:34,190 --> 00:55:37,770
strategic weapons, and you
have payload constraints--

1122
00:55:37,770 --> 00:55:39,820
you're trading off
range for payload,

1123
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:43,760
so a plutonium gets you much
better yield-to-weight ratios.

1124
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,630
So it is about 4 to 1 advantage.

1125
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:51,520
And once they had
the uranium devices,

1126
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,320
they're worried--
Pakistan was always

1127
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:56,780
worried that India would
attack its nuclear facilities.

1128
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:58,840
Once it acquired basic
nuclear weapons capability

1129
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:02,264
through the uranium pathway, now
it doesn't fear that as much.

1130
00:56:02,264 --> 00:56:04,680
And so most of the plutonium
production is out in the open

1131
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:05,626
and with Chinese help.

1132
00:56:05,626 --> 00:56:07,250
So there are series
of Chinese reactors

1133
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:10,170
and reprocessing facilities
that are coming on line.

1134
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:13,850
And Pakistan is shifting
to plutonium production,

1135
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:17,392
primarily for its battlefield
nuclear weapons capability.

1136
00:56:17,392 --> 00:56:19,100
It's delivery capabilities
were initially

1137
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:21,020
bought from China
and North Korea,

1138
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:24,000
so there were missiles for
uranium enrichment capability

1139
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,800
trade that Pakistan had with
China-- sorry-- with North

1140
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,721
Korea.

1141
00:56:28,721 --> 00:56:30,720
So it got the No-Dong
missiles from North Korea.

1142
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,430
In exchange, North
Korea got some basis

1143
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:37,670
for its uranium enrichment
capability that it now has.

1144
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:44,390
And China also sold
Pakistan some MX-4 missiles,

1145
00:56:44,390 --> 00:56:48,137
which are the Shaheen and
Gaznavi missiles for Pakistan.

1146
00:56:48,137 --> 00:56:50,553
AUDIENCE: What's the motivation
for China to sell and give

1147
00:56:50,553 --> 00:56:52,110
this aid to Pakistan?

1148
00:56:52,110 --> 00:56:54,026
VIPIN NARANG: Well, so
if you're China, what's

1149
00:56:54,026 --> 00:56:55,920
the advantage of having
Pakistan be nuclear

1150
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,220
and-- who's in the middle?

1151
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:01,920
Look at thee-- They can
sandwich India, right?

1152
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:05,610
So the enemy of my
enemy is my friend.

1153
00:57:05,610 --> 00:57:08,485
AUDIENCE: I mean it seams China
had their own nuclear weapons,

1154
00:57:08,485 --> 00:57:11,922
so anything from Pakistan
would be trivial.

1155
00:57:11,922 --> 00:57:13,395
Pakistan's a little unstable.

1156
00:57:13,395 --> 00:57:17,570
You never quite know if the
government collapses, what

1157
00:57:17,570 --> 00:57:18,820
might happen to those weapons.

1158
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:20,430
VIPIN NARANG: No, I mean these
are all reasonable questions.

1159
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:22,430
And I think they're raised
of the Chinese a lot.

1160
00:57:22,430 --> 00:57:25,530
Like that you provide a
state a nuclear capability

1161
00:57:25,530 --> 00:57:29,320
or assist them, but you don't
want to take responsibility

1162
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:33,250
if there's a fracture in the
state and nuclear weapons

1163
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:35,350
fall into extremist hands.

1164
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:37,050
And the Chinese
will always-- you

1165
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:39,330
go to some of these Track
IIs and China has always

1166
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:40,800
washed their hands of it.

1167
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,787
But you can think from
a strategic perspective

1168
00:57:42,787 --> 00:57:45,370
why it makes sense for them to
have India focused on Pakistan,

1169
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:46,453
and this is one way to do.

1170
00:57:46,453 --> 00:57:50,090
And I think that's the
Chinese motivation.

1171
00:57:50,090 --> 00:57:54,010
So Pakistan,
because it is trying

1172
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:56,120
to deter Indian
conventional power,

1173
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:59,510
has an explicit
first use doctrine.

1174
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:04,460
And this has evolved in
the past 15, 16 years.

1175
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:07,635
First of all, it's
credible because all

1176
00:58:07,635 --> 00:58:10,290
of Pakistan's nuclear weapons
are under military custody.

1177
00:58:10,290 --> 00:58:12,450
Unlike India where the
civilian custody and control

1178
00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:15,340
of nuclear weapons, Pakistan
is a de facto praetorian state.

1179
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:18,300
The Army is a dominant
decision making body.

1180
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:21,010
And so all the nuclear weapons
program, from cradle to grave,

1181
00:58:21,010 --> 00:58:23,060
is under army management.

1182
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:24,910
So they control the
nuclear weapons program.

1183
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:27,870
There's been a shift to
battlefield nuclear weapons.

1184
00:58:27,870 --> 00:58:30,460
There's a capability
known as the NASR missile.

1185
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:34,650
If anyone's been following
this, it's a 60 kilometer,

1186
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:40,340
short range nuclear
weapon system

1187
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:42,965
that will be fielded at the
rear edge of battle that

1188
00:58:42,965 --> 00:58:44,970
would target Indian
forces if they

1189
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:46,772
cross the international border.

1190
00:58:46,772 --> 00:58:48,980
They have a series of cruise
missiles, which are also

1191
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:51,188
designed to be battlefield
nuclear weapons, the Ra'ad

1192
00:58:51,188 --> 00:58:51,880
and the Babur.

1193
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:54,435
And they have an explicitly
deterrence by denial mission.

1194
00:58:54,435 --> 00:58:56,560
They're trying to deter
Indian conventional attacks

1195
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:58,270
across the international border.

1196
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:06,690
So there are some--
any questions

1197
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:11,770
about where we are in terms of
how India and Pakistan think

1198
00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:13,870
about nuclear weapons
in their force postures?

1199
00:59:13,870 --> 00:59:14,160
Yeah?

1200
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,435
AUDIENCE: Around that time
was India suggesting at all

1201
00:59:16,435 --> 00:59:19,454
that that they were
interested in traditional war

1202
00:59:19,454 --> 00:59:20,110
with Pakistan?

1203
00:59:20,110 --> 00:59:20,970
VIPIN NARANG: So this is
an excellent question.

1204
00:59:20,970 --> 00:59:23,660
Why would Pakistan-- I'll
skip through some of this

1205
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:28,480
because the crux of the
problem now is India

1206
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:31,040
doesn't have any territorial
designs on Pakistan.

1207
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:34,320
Why would India want to
dismember Pakistani further?

1208
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,410
It prefers a stable Pakistan.

1209
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:38,400
It has no territorial
ambitions in Pakistan.

1210
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,230
There are some-- Kashmir
is a disputed-- there's

1211
00:59:41,230 --> 00:59:42,610
a dispute over Kashmir.

1212
00:59:42,610 --> 00:59:45,540
But frankly, the line
of control on both sides

1213
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,860
is effectively the
de facto border.

1214
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:51,171
There won't be much territorial
revision over Kashmir.

1215
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:53,670
And certainly, if you're worried
about a conventional attack

1216
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:58,180
across the international
border, how do you get there?

1217
00:59:58,180 --> 01:00:02,290
I'll get to that in one second
after very quickly talking

1218
01:00:02,290 --> 01:00:05,080
about, in the
nuclear sense, what

1219
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:07,640
the difference is between
South Asian the Cold War.

1220
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:09,810
So both sides now
have nuclear weapons.

1221
01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:12,200
Some of the key differences
between India, Pakistan,

1222
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:13,990
and the United States
and the Soviet Union

1223
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:18,300
are, one, rudimentary
capabilities still,

1224
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:19,860
organizational
command and control

1225
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:22,830
is not as mature in either
country as in the Cold

1226
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:27,630
War, especially in the later
years the Cold War obviously.

1227
01:00:27,630 --> 01:00:30,540
But the other big difference
is they border each other.

1228
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:33,500
So the flight times
between India and Pakistan

1229
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:36,700
is on the order of
a couple minutes.

1230
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:38,990
The US and Soviet
Union was 30 minutes.

1231
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:42,504
So you had a half hour to
figure what was going on.

1232
01:00:42,504 --> 01:00:45,540
In India and Pakistan,
you have two minutes--

1233
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:48,040
if you had any early warning--
and early warning systems are

1234
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:49,720
very rudimentary-- if you
had any early warning,

1235
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:51,610
or indication that the
other side is launching

1236
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:53,160
a potential nuclear strike,
you have two minutes

1237
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:54,800
before that thing
is going to hit.

1238
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:57,860
So your reaction times
have to be much quicker.

1239
01:00:57,860 --> 01:00:59,790
The other big difference
is-- I'm going

1240
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:02,800
to skip through this here.

1241
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:07,380
The other big difference
is, as you mentioned,

1242
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:10,820
why would India be interested
in conventional attacks

1243
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:12,154
against Pakistan?

1244
01:01:12,154 --> 01:01:13,820
Well, it wouldn't be
ab-- it wouldn't be

1245
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:15,180
the first to initiate conflict.

1246
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:17,070
The Indian problem
right now is it

1247
01:01:17,070 --> 01:01:21,580
is facing a Pakistan that is
more aggressively emboldened

1248
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:24,880
to launch militant attacks
in India using organization--

1249
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,990
proxy organization
sponsored by the state--

1250
01:01:26,990 --> 01:01:28,830
or believed to be
sponsored by the state,

1251
01:01:28,830 --> 01:01:31,340
like Lushkar-e-Taiba,
Jaish-e-Mohammed.

1252
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:33,722
And the strategy has
changed since Pakistan

1253
01:01:33,722 --> 01:01:34,680
tested nuclear weapons.

1254
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:40,020
Prior to 1998, Pakistan--
there was a strategy,

1255
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:43,410
coined by Zia and
General Aslam Baig,

1256
01:01:43,410 --> 01:01:46,040
known as bleeding
India by 1,000 cuts.

1257
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:48,730
So there's a strategy of
cutting India at the periphery.

1258
01:01:48,730 --> 01:01:51,495
In the line of control in
Jammu Kashmir in the mountains,

1259
01:01:51,495 --> 01:01:53,370
you couldn't have a real
conventional battle,

1260
01:01:53,370 --> 01:01:55,120
but you could have
terrorist infiltration.

1261
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:59,800
There would be some attacks
and just small cuts.

1262
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,720
But the strategy has shifted
since 1998, it seems.

1263
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:05,860
The frequency of
over infiltration

1264
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:09,250
by regular forces in
the Kargil War in 1999

1265
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:13,200
and then multiple attacks on
Indian metropolitan cities

1266
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,892
with these Pakistan-based
militant organizations.

1267
01:02:16,892 --> 01:02:18,350
It leads to a
condition where India

1268
01:02:18,350 --> 01:02:20,820
wouldn't be starting a war,
but it would be retaliating.

1269
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:23,620
So India's mainstay threat
prior to nuclearization

1270
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:27,512
was if you try the strategy of
bleeding us by a thousand cuts,

1271
01:02:27,512 --> 01:02:29,220
we're going to punish
you where it hurts.

1272
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:30,720
We're going to
destroy your army.

1273
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:34,169
If you're an army led state,
an army controlled state,

1274
01:02:34,169 --> 01:02:35,710
we'll cross the
international border,

1275
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:37,890
and we will attrit your army.

1276
01:02:37,890 --> 01:02:39,609
And that will punish Pakistan.

1277
01:02:39,609 --> 01:02:41,650
So that was the deterrence
by punishment strategy

1278
01:02:41,650 --> 01:02:45,050
India had at the conventional
level prior to nuclearization.

1279
01:02:45,050 --> 01:02:48,520
But post-nuclearization
now Pakistan is doing what?

1280
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:51,530
It threatens-- well, it's going
to stand and fight for a while.

1281
01:02:51,530 --> 01:02:54,290
But in extreme, it threatens
tactical nuclear use

1282
01:02:54,290 --> 01:02:56,780
on Indian forces if
India tries to retaliate

1283
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:58,570
across the international border.

1284
01:02:58,570 --> 01:03:00,900
And so that's the scenario
that India finds itself now.

1285
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:02,310
And that's the
scenario in which India

1286
01:03:02,310 --> 01:03:04,560
would think about conventional
conflict with Pakistan.

1287
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:06,129
It's not for
territorial ambition

1288
01:03:06,129 --> 01:03:07,170
or any territorial gains.

1289
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:10,810
It would be for retaliation
after a provocation.

1290
01:03:10,810 --> 01:03:14,070
So there are a couple examples.

1291
01:03:14,070 --> 01:03:15,470
The first is the Kargil War.

1292
01:03:15,470 --> 01:03:18,450
Does anyone remember
this, May 1999?

1293
01:03:18,450 --> 01:03:24,320
So this was a year after
they tested nuclear weapons.

1294
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:29,920
General Pervez Musharraf,
who ended up being president

1295
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:32,630
during the first phase of
the Afghan war in 2000-- this

1296
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:36,540
was right before September--
two years before September 11.

1297
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:38,760
Nawaz Sharif-- man history
does repeat itself.

1298
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,190
Nawaz Sharif was then
the prime minister.

1299
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:46,230
He is again the prime
minister today by the way.

1300
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:48,230
He claims he had no
knowledge of this operation.

1301
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:50,040
But then General
Pervez Musharraf,

1302
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:52,750
who was the chief of army
staff, orchestrated an operation

1303
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:56,780
where un-uniformed regular
Pakistan forces, known

1304
01:03:56,780 --> 01:03:59,610
as the Northern Light Infiltry--
the Northern Light Infantry,

1305
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:04,190
infiltrated into several sectors
in to Indian held Kashmir,

1306
01:04:04,190 --> 01:04:05,240
into Indian territory.

1307
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:09,610
And India responded
with trying to dislodge

1308
01:04:09,610 --> 01:04:11,460
the Pakistani forces.

1309
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:15,800
Previously, this exact operation
had been attempted in 1965.

1310
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:18,070
India launched air strikes
across the line of control

1311
01:04:18,070 --> 01:04:21,270
and opened a second front
across the international border.

1312
01:04:21,270 --> 01:04:25,850
This, time the BJP
responded very differently.

1313
01:04:25,850 --> 01:04:28,870
Because of Pakistan's
nuclearization,

1314
01:04:28,870 --> 01:04:32,510
the BJP was much more restrained
and sustained heavier losses

1315
01:04:32,510 --> 01:04:36,510
because the threat of
escalating the conflict

1316
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:39,920
deterred the BJP from
the same kind of response

1317
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:42,230
that it had in 1965--
that India had.

1318
01:04:42,230 --> 01:04:44,950
So it refused to
allow air operations

1319
01:04:44,950 --> 01:04:46,650
across the line of control.

1320
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:49,860
So Indian aircraft could not
cross the line of control

1321
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:53,064
in hot pursuit of
Pakistsani infiltrators.

1322
01:04:53,064 --> 01:04:54,480
And most importantly,
they did not

1323
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,021
threaten to open up
the second front.

1324
01:04:56,021 --> 01:04:59,990
The place where India's
conventional advantage really

1325
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:05,496
comes to bear is on the
international border, here.

1326
01:05:05,496 --> 01:05:06,870
So most of the
fighting was here.

1327
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:08,760
This was where the
infiltration was.

1328
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:11,350
But India has a huge advantage
in this plane sector, which

1329
01:05:11,350 --> 01:05:12,516
is the international border.

1330
01:05:12,516 --> 01:05:14,842
So any time there has been
a previous provocation,

1331
01:05:14,842 --> 01:05:17,050
India has always mobilized
forces here and threatened

1332
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:18,925
to open up a second
front where it can really

1333
01:05:18,925 --> 01:05:21,080
bring its conventional
power to bear on Pakistan.

1334
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:24,570
This time, the BJP
refused to threaten

1335
01:05:24,570 --> 01:05:26,150
to open-- it did
not mobilize any

1336
01:05:26,150 --> 01:05:27,820
of its mainstay
conventional forces

1337
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:29,915
on the international
border and didn't threaten

1338
01:05:29,915 --> 01:05:31,120
to open up a second front.

1339
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:33,620
And so it took Indian
forces a lot longer,

1340
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:36,630
and they sustained much heavier
losses in the Kargil War,

1341
01:05:36,630 --> 01:05:41,460
because they had to expel
Pakistani forces symmetrically.

1342
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:44,840
So they didn't have the
virtue of air power hitting

1343
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,510
behind Pakistani lines.

1344
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:52,250
And there wasn't any ability to
take pressure off of this front

1345
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:56,200
by opening up a second front
in the international border.

1346
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:58,740
So already you can see
India's response is restrained

1347
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:02,190
because Pakistan
was a nuclear power.

1348
01:06:02,190 --> 01:06:06,380
So shortly after September
11 here, two months later--

1349
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:09,740
three months later,
there was an attack

1350
01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:10,920
on the Indian parliament.

1351
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:14,294
So you had about half
a dozen gunman break

1352
01:06:14,294 --> 01:06:16,460
through the barriers of the
Indian Parliament house.

1353
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:18,670
I mean imagine an
attack on Congress here.

1354
01:06:18,670 --> 01:06:19,800
It would be the equivalent.

1355
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:26,510
So you had Jaish-e-Mohammed and
Lushkar-e-Taiba joint attack

1356
01:06:26,510 --> 01:06:28,530
on the Indian
parliament in Delhi.

1357
01:06:28,530 --> 01:06:31,780
Never heard of before that
they-- these militant groups,

1358
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:35,280
which are nominally supported
by the Pakistani state,

1359
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,150
would attack the Indian capital.

1360
01:06:38,150 --> 01:06:40,380
So you had this
attack in December.

1361
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:42,381
The BJP is furious.

1362
01:06:42,381 --> 01:06:43,880
Imagine what the
United States would

1363
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:48,680
do if a militant organization
attacked the US Congress.

1364
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:51,670
So you can imagine the
outrage in India at the time.

1365
01:06:51,670 --> 01:06:55,000
So the BJP contemplates
limited war here

1366
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:59,320
across the line of control,
so destroying terrorist camps

1367
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:01,720
across the line of control.

1368
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:03,675
Under a lot of pressure
from the US government

1369
01:07:03,675 --> 01:07:05,050
because remember
what's happened?

1370
01:07:05,050 --> 01:07:07,492
We were mobilizing for war
on Afghanistan at this point.

1371
01:07:07,492 --> 01:07:08,200
We need Pakistan.

1372
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:11,210
The United States
needs General Musharraf

1373
01:07:11,210 --> 01:07:14,080
to not be distracted by a
conventional war with India.

1374
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:16,690
Can you imagine how that
would have affected the US

1375
01:07:16,690 --> 01:07:18,571
war in Afghanistan if
India and Pakistan got

1376
01:07:18,571 --> 01:07:20,070
into a conventional
war at the time.

1377
01:07:20,070 --> 01:07:23,000
So a lot of pressure on
both sides to not go to war.

1378
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,051
So Deputy Secretary of State
at the time, Dick Armitage,

1379
01:07:26,051 --> 01:07:26,800
gets on the phone.

1380
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:30,710
He's on the phone, he said,
twice a day with the BJP

1381
01:07:30,710 --> 01:07:33,690
urging them to show restraint.

1382
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:36,250
And India backs off
actually for a while.

1383
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:38,940
But then there's
a secondary attack

1384
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:42,390
in a small town called
Kaluchack in Jammu,

1385
01:07:42,390 --> 01:07:43,440
which is an army town.

1386
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:47,670
And the Jaish militants killed
36 Indian army families.

1387
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:49,480
And so the BJP, at
this point-- this

1388
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:52,049
is the second peak
of the crisis.

1389
01:07:52,049 --> 01:07:53,590
And so the BJP says
enough is enough.

1390
01:07:53,590 --> 01:07:57,730
So they mobilize India's three--
they call them the three Strike

1391
01:07:57,730 --> 01:07:58,640
Corps.

1392
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:01,560
These are the main offensive
components of the Indian army.

1393
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:03,940
800,000 forces in total.

1394
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:06,430
And they're mobilized in
their assembly boxes, which

1395
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:10,490
are much larger than shown
here, 60 kilometer breadth,

1396
01:08:10,490 --> 01:08:13,960
in these three positions,
poised for attacks

1397
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:15,863
across the international border.

1398
01:08:15,863 --> 01:08:17,279
So this is where
the threat of war

1399
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:19,660
becomes real for South Asia.

1400
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:24,520
SO the BJP, you don't mobilize
these forces just as a bluff.

1401
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:26,870
And so there's a real
concern that the BJP

1402
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:29,040
would authorize attacks.

1403
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,829
And at this point,
Pakistan engages

1404
01:08:30,829 --> 01:08:32,120
in some serious nuclear signal.

1405
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:34,520
They test three nuclear
capable missiles,

1406
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:37,910
without the warheads of course.

1407
01:08:37,910 --> 01:08:40,240
President Musharraf makes
very explicit nuclear threats

1408
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:42,656
to the Indians that if they
cross the international border

1409
01:08:42,656 --> 01:08:45,810
that Pakistan may have no option
but to use nuclear weapons.

1410
01:08:45,810 --> 01:08:48,500
The US and the United
Kingdom evacuate

1411
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,640
their nonessential
personnel from India.

1412
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:52,348
I mean it was very
serious at this point.

1413
01:08:58,529 --> 01:09:01,330
After these nuclear
threats, and again,

1414
01:09:01,330 --> 01:09:05,140
a lot of pressure from the
United States on India,

1415
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:08,529
Prime Minister Vajpayee
orders, several months later,

1416
01:09:08,529 --> 01:09:11,210
the Strike Corps back to their
peacetime cantonments, which

1417
01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:12,970
are in the interior of India.

1418
01:09:12,970 --> 01:09:15,910
And later on, he
said, look, I don't

1419
01:09:15,910 --> 01:09:17,660
think that a risk of
nuclear war was high,

1420
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:20,200
but I didn't want to be
responsible for starting one.

1421
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:21,881
And so there was a
real palpable threat

1422
01:09:21,881 --> 01:09:24,380
that if India engaged in this
kind of conventional operation

1423
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:26,840
against Pakistan and
defeated the Pakistan army,

1424
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:29,340
that there's a real risk that
nuclear weapons would be used.

1425
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,650
The third instance was
the Bombay attack in 2008

1426
01:09:37,650 --> 01:09:40,270
that we already talked
about at the beginning.

1427
01:09:40,270 --> 01:09:45,040
So here, this was even more
audacious, in some ways,

1428
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:46,439
than the parliament attack.

1429
01:09:46,439 --> 01:09:49,880
This wasn't a ragtag group
of six guys in a car.

1430
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:52,689
This was a dozen well-trained,
heavily armed militants coming

1431
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:56,140
by sea from Karachi,
quarterbacked-- it now turns

1432
01:09:56,140 --> 01:10:02,480
out-- by retired ISI handlers.

1433
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:05,830
The United States picked
up signals intelligence

1434
01:10:05,830 --> 01:10:10,320
and intercepts between
handlers in Pakistan

1435
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:14,560
who were former ISI officers
quarterbacking the operation

1436
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:17,090
as they attacked Bombay.

1437
01:10:17,090 --> 01:10:19,680
And it killed 170 civilians.

1438
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:25,580
So the media tends to downplay
the number of Westerners that

1439
01:10:25,580 --> 01:10:29,600
were deliberately
targeted by the militant--

1440
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:33,640
by the LeT militants.

1441
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:39,530
And India was justifiably
outraged at this attack.

1442
01:10:39,530 --> 01:10:42,022
But the government
was again paralyzed.

1443
01:10:42,022 --> 01:10:43,730
So this time it's the
Congress government

1444
01:10:43,730 --> 01:10:46,210
not the BJP government
that's making decisions.

1445
01:10:46,210 --> 01:10:48,270
And it doesn't mobilize
forces this time.

1446
01:10:48,270 --> 01:10:49,900
The prime minister,
Mahmud Hussein,

1447
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:53,660
said he did not want a
repeat of 2001, 2002.

1448
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:56,080
We don't want to mobilize
forces and not do anything.

1449
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:57,560
So what do we do?

1450
01:10:57,560 --> 01:11:01,230
And here we have the paralysis
that the Indian policy

1451
01:11:01,230 --> 01:11:05,609
community faces is any serious
conventional retaliation risks

1452
01:11:05,609 --> 01:11:06,400
nuclear escalation.

1453
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:09,320
I think this is where
India finds itself.

1454
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:12,520
And this is from
a cabinet meeting.

1455
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:14,460
So this is a report
from the cabinet meeting

1456
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:16,950
where the prime
minister and the defense

1457
01:11:16,950 --> 01:11:21,090
minister, foreign minister,
finance minister, home minister

1458
01:11:21,090 --> 01:11:22,710
are meeting.

1459
01:11:22,710 --> 01:11:24,810
And the conclusion was,
when the dust settled,

1460
01:11:24,810 --> 01:11:26,660
all the principles agreed
that the unpredictability

1461
01:11:26,660 --> 01:11:28,610
on the Pakistan side and the
fear that its decision-makers

1462
01:11:28,610 --> 01:11:30,900
could offer a disproportionate
response, including

1463
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:33,260
the nuclear option,
stymied any possible chance

1464
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:37,630
of military action on India'a
behalf after-- 26/11 is their--

1465
01:11:37,630 --> 01:11:39,310
is what they call
the Bombay attacks.

1466
01:11:39,310 --> 01:11:43,270
It happened on the
26th of November.

1467
01:11:43,270 --> 01:11:47,180
So there's real
paralysis now about how

1468
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:50,150
do you deter-- see
nuclear weapons can't

1469
01:11:50,150 --> 01:11:52,929
deter militant attacks
against the Indian state.

1470
01:11:52,929 --> 01:11:54,470
But you lost your
conventional option

1471
01:11:54,470 --> 01:11:56,261
to punish Pakistan,
which was how you tried

1472
01:11:56,261 --> 01:11:58,370
to deter it in the first place.

1473
01:11:58,370 --> 01:12:01,460
And Pakistan has
successfully deterred

1474
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:04,700
Indian a conventional power by
lowering the nuclear threshold,

1475
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:08,100
taking a play right out
of the NATO playbook,

1476
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:11,335
threatening early nuclear use if
Indian forces threaten to cross

1477
01:12:11,335 --> 01:12:14,170
the international border.

1478
01:12:14,170 --> 01:12:16,260
So now, after
nuclearization 1998,

1479
01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:18,320
what we have is more
frequent and intense

1480
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:21,024
crises triggered by Pakistan.

1481
01:12:21,024 --> 01:12:22,690
There's a belief that
they're emboldened

1482
01:12:22,690 --> 01:12:25,740
by the shield of
early nuclear use,

1483
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:30,087
knowing that India can't really
retaliate with ground power.

1484
01:12:30,087 --> 01:12:32,170
We can get into-- we have
some time for questions.

1485
01:12:32,170 --> 01:12:35,130
We can get into why India hasn't
tried to develop an air strike

1486
01:12:35,130 --> 01:12:36,074
option.

1487
01:12:36,074 --> 01:12:38,240
That gets into the politics
of the Indian military--

1488
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:41,020
the service rivalries
that India has.

1489
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:47,360
The Air Force has always
refused to think about options

1490
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,710
that don't involve
the army mobilizing

1491
01:12:49,710 --> 01:12:52,630
because the belief is that
Pakistan would retaliate

1492
01:12:52,630 --> 01:12:53,610
on the ground.

1493
01:12:53,610 --> 01:12:57,030
And so the Air Force doesn't
believe that standalone air

1494
01:12:57,030 --> 01:13:00,590
options are possible without a
ground option being mobilized.

1495
01:13:00,590 --> 01:13:02,115
AUDIENCE: So what
is Pakistan trying

1496
01:13:02,115 --> 01:13:03,366
to achieve with these attacks?

1497
01:13:03,366 --> 01:13:05,823
VIPIN NARANG: So this is an
interesting strategic question.

1498
01:13:05,823 --> 01:13:07,830
What does Pakistan hope--
so if your Pakistan,

1499
01:13:07,830 --> 01:13:09,371
you're facing a
conventional-- you're

1500
01:13:09,371 --> 01:13:11,720
facing massive conventional
inferiority, which is only

1501
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:14,180
growing because the size
and growth rates of the two

1502
01:13:14,180 --> 01:13:16,460
countries are so
disproportionate that India's

1503
01:13:16,460 --> 01:13:18,420
gap is just going-- it's
going to be a yawning

1504
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:20,130
gap at this point.

1505
01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:23,130
So going forward, how
do you slow India down?

1506
01:13:23,130 --> 01:13:25,580
So there's one theory
out there, which

1507
01:13:25,580 --> 01:13:30,400
is these periodic attacks on
India's financial and political

1508
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:34,690
hubs create these
periodic crises to get

1509
01:13:34,690 --> 01:13:36,900
foreign investors skittish.

1510
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:39,210
So you get periodic slowdowns
being triggered by this,

1511
01:13:39,210 --> 01:13:41,730
and you can slow down
India's economic growth

1512
01:13:41,730 --> 01:13:44,609
potential if you make it
risky to invest in India.

1513
01:13:44,609 --> 01:13:45,900
So that's one theory out there.

1514
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:50,030
The other theory is Pakistan
has always had crazies

1515
01:13:50,030 --> 01:13:51,870
that is trained to attack.

1516
01:13:51,870 --> 01:13:53,680
Good crazies kill Indians.

1517
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:55,430
Bad crazies kill Pakistanis.

1518
01:13:55,430 --> 01:13:58,017
And so they need-- there's
a safety valve theory.

1519
01:13:58,017 --> 01:13:59,600
And they've always
had a safety valve.

1520
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,020
Before it was Kashmir.

1521
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:03,310
Now, Kashmir is locked
down because Indian army

1522
01:14:03,310 --> 01:14:06,387
knows how to prevent
infiltration at Kashmir.

1523
01:14:06,387 --> 01:14:07,720
For a while, it was Afghanistan.

1524
01:14:10,827 --> 01:14:13,160
US military has to be asked,
why are these guys speaking

1525
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:14,320
Punjabi in Afghanistan?

1526
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:17,410
Because these are the Punjabi
trained militants, the LeT,

1527
01:14:17,410 --> 01:14:20,420
that have gone now to
Afghanistan to fight,

1528
01:14:20,420 --> 01:14:21,860
and they're killing Americans.

1529
01:14:21,860 --> 01:14:24,690
And now if you can turn them
against the Indian state,

1530
01:14:24,690 --> 01:14:26,611
great.

1531
01:14:26,611 --> 01:14:28,360
As long as they're not
killing Pakistanis,

1532
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:29,360
they are good militants.

1533
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:31,600
And so there's one
theory out there

1534
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:37,400
that the Pakistan state still
views these militant groups

1535
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:40,100
as strategic assets
of the states

1536
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:44,160
to perpetually attack and
bleed India by 1,000 cuts.

1537
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:47,920
And if you can't get
in through Kashmir,

1538
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:51,740
if you could infiltrate
by sea to Bombay, great.

1539
01:14:51,740 --> 01:14:54,170
If you can hit Delhi, great.

1540
01:14:54,170 --> 01:14:56,460
Before nuclear weapons,
hitting Bombay or Delhi

1541
01:14:56,460 --> 01:14:59,389
really risked serious
conventional retaliation.

1542
01:14:59,389 --> 01:15:00,930
But now that you
have nuclear weapons

1543
01:15:00,930 --> 01:15:03,000
and operational
nuclear capability

1544
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,960
and tactical nuclear
weapons to deter

1545
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:07,650
that conventional
retaliation, those kinds

1546
01:15:07,650 --> 01:15:09,820
of audacious attacks
are more possible.

1547
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:12,070
And so these are the two
kind of theories out there,

1548
01:15:12,070 --> 01:15:13,560
and they're not
mutually exclusive.

1549
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:18,286
AUDIENCE: What [INAUDIBLE]
in Afghanistan.

1550
01:15:18,286 --> 01:15:20,161
What are they called
the thieves, the rebels,

1551
01:15:20,161 --> 01:15:24,369
or whatever-- they were fighting
[INAUDIBLE] in Afghanistan?

1552
01:15:24,369 --> 01:15:26,660
VIPIN NARANG: I mean I think
that there are people here

1553
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:28,749
who can say more
about this who had

1554
01:15:28,749 --> 01:15:30,040
firsthand experience with this.

1555
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:34,410
But there are a lot of reports
that you had Punjabi speaking.

1556
01:15:34,410 --> 01:15:40,670
I mean most of the Afghan
mujahideen are Pashto speaking.

1557
01:15:40,670 --> 01:15:42,050
There's a Haqqani network.

1558
01:15:42,050 --> 01:15:46,140
A lot of these
networks predate 9/11.

1559
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:50,160
And they were supported,
funded, and there

1560
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:53,120
are strong relationships
between the ISI

1561
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:56,227
and some of the mujahideen
groups in Afghanistan that

1562
01:15:56,227 --> 01:15:58,310
ended up being the Taliban--
remember the only two

1563
01:15:58,310 --> 01:15:59,935
states that recognized
the Taliban were

1564
01:15:59,935 --> 01:16:01,500
Pakistan, Saudi Arabia.

1565
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:04,900
So the networks that
Pakistan had in Afghanistan

1566
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:05,880
were very strong.

1567
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:07,870
And they had these
other groups also,

1568
01:16:07,870 --> 01:16:11,800
so if they needed militants
to go help fight what ended up

1569
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:14,750
being the Americans as
well as Karzai's ANA,

1570
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:19,100
it would be the LeT and
the Jaish-e-Mohammeds.

1571
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:21,490
So there were reports of
Punjabi speaking militants,

1572
01:16:21,490 --> 01:16:24,480
well-trained Punjabi
speaking militants,

1573
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:26,420
fighting in Afghanistan
alongside Pashto

1574
01:16:26,420 --> 01:16:29,290
speaking Haqqani
network militants.

1575
01:16:29,290 --> 01:16:32,180
So that was a safety
valve for a while.

1576
01:16:32,180 --> 01:16:35,230
And now, I think
this is why Pakistan

1577
01:16:35,230 --> 01:16:36,727
may have an
incentive for a fight

1578
01:16:36,727 --> 01:16:38,310
to continue in
Afghanistan for a while

1579
01:16:38,310 --> 01:16:40,477
so it has someplace
to send its crazies.

1580
01:16:40,477 --> 01:16:41,810
It's a safety valve for a while.

1581
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:44,185
And they're worried about
Indian influence in Afghanistan

1582
01:16:44,185 --> 01:16:47,600
so that there would
be-- those militants

1583
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:49,870
would be boxed into Pakistan.

1584
01:16:49,870 --> 01:16:51,250
On the one hand,
Pakistan faces--

1585
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:55,730
there was this awful
school attack recently.

1586
01:16:55,730 --> 01:16:58,775
There's a real terrorist
problem in Pakistan also.

1587
01:16:58,775 --> 01:17:00,150
So bad militants
kill Pakistanis.

1588
01:17:00,150 --> 01:17:01,405
Good militants kill
Indians and Americans.

1589
01:17:01,405 --> 01:17:01,905
Steph?

1590
01:17:01,905 --> 01:17:04,100
AUDIENCE: I was going
to ask that question as

1591
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:06,980
to whether [INAUDIBLE]
are all bad.

1592
01:17:06,980 --> 01:17:09,380
But initially, that
comes out maybe

1593
01:17:09,380 --> 01:17:11,670
to supporting the
militants out there.

1594
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:16,576
Do you think that that is--
that initial rhetoric is

1595
01:17:16,576 --> 01:17:17,310
going to stick?

1596
01:17:17,310 --> 01:17:19,337
Or do you think they
will then go back

1597
01:17:19,337 --> 01:17:20,803
to what they've
always done which

1598
01:17:20,803 --> 01:17:23,002
is we're going to support
whoever destablizes people

1599
01:17:23,002 --> 01:17:23,350
we don't like?

1600
01:17:23,350 --> 01:17:25,766
VIPIN NARANG: So I think the
evidence suggests the latter.

1601
01:17:25,766 --> 01:17:32,200
I mean it is remarkable that
the LeT-- so after 2001, 2000,

1602
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:35,180
the LeT was nominally banned.

1603
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:37,490
But they just renamed
themselves to Jamaat-ud-Dawa.

1604
01:17:37,490 --> 01:17:41,780
And Hafiz Saeed who is
the head of the LeT lives

1605
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:43,930
openly, not out in
the tribal areas.

1606
01:17:43,930 --> 01:17:46,070
He lives outside Lahore
in a town called Muridke.

1607
01:17:46,070 --> 01:17:47,484
Everybody knows where they are.

1608
01:17:47,484 --> 01:17:48,650
They're openly fund-raising.

1609
01:17:48,650 --> 01:17:54,330
He goes on TV calling for
the death of Indians openly.

1610
01:17:54,330 --> 01:17:58,720
And the fact that he--
it's an open question

1611
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:01,880
whether it's active
support or passive support.

1612
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:04,930
But at least the evidence
suggest-- the evidence suggests

1613
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:06,425
at least passive support.

1614
01:18:06,425 --> 01:18:08,920
He is allowed to freely operate.

1615
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:11,240
He is allowed to
freely raise funds.

1616
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:12,240
The organization exists.

1617
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:13,340
It could be shut
down very easily.

1618
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:14,790
It's in the heart of Pakistan.

1619
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:17,450
It's like 30 kilometers
from the Indian border.

1620
01:18:17,450 --> 01:18:19,060
The Indians could hit it.

1621
01:18:19,060 --> 01:18:21,610
But they have refrained
from doing so.

1622
01:18:21,610 --> 01:18:24,724
But the network is allowed to
recruit and operate openly.

1623
01:18:24,724 --> 01:18:27,390
And we're not talking about like
the Northwest Front, the Khyber

1624
01:18:27,390 --> 01:18:30,180
Pakhtunkhwa, the tribal areas.

1625
01:18:30,180 --> 01:18:32,220
This is the heartland
of Pakistan.

1626
01:18:32,220 --> 01:18:41,210
And so it offends credibility
to think that it's not--

1627
01:18:41,210 --> 01:18:45,670
there isn't some state policy to
allow certain groups to operate

1628
01:18:45,670 --> 01:18:49,179
to some extent while thinking
you could target the rest.

1629
01:18:49,179 --> 01:18:51,720
But there's also that suggests
these guys were different hats

1630
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:53,210
on different days.

1631
01:18:53,210 --> 01:18:57,580
But the sectarian groups, I
think, are allowed to operate.

1632
01:18:57,580 --> 01:18:59,980
Those are the ones that--
the other good militants seem

1633
01:18:59,980 --> 01:19:01,105
to be those that kill Shia.

1634
01:19:01,105 --> 01:19:03,170
As long as they don't
kill Sunni, it's fine.

1635
01:19:03,170 --> 01:19:05,960
So some of those groups
have been very, very fierce

1636
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:08,590
and are allowed
to operate still.

1637
01:19:08,590 --> 01:19:11,890
In the Haqqani
network and the LeT,

1638
01:19:11,890 --> 01:19:14,780
as long as they're not
killing Sunnis in Punjab,

1639
01:19:14,780 --> 01:19:16,540
it seems like the
Pakistani state

1640
01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:19,929
is willing to tolerate
their existence.

1641
01:19:19,929 --> 01:19:21,470
And so that's an
active state policy.

1642
01:19:21,470 --> 01:19:22,920
And this is different
from the Cold War.

1643
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:24,670
We didn't have-- I don't
think the United States

1644
01:19:24,670 --> 01:19:27,390
and the Soviet Union had to deal
with that kind of proxy level

1645
01:19:27,390 --> 01:19:29,412
militancy where you have
two strategic assets.

1646
01:19:29,412 --> 01:19:30,870
You have the militant
organizations

1647
01:19:30,870 --> 01:19:33,119
to try and weaken the other
state plus nuclear weapons

1648
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:34,989
to deter the retaliation.

1649
01:19:34,989 --> 01:19:36,530
So that combination
is, I think, what

1650
01:19:36,530 --> 01:19:41,090
makes it particularly dangerous,
which is what I conclude here.

1651
01:19:41,090 --> 01:19:44,970
So you have-- India is
extremely frustrated.

1652
01:19:44,970 --> 01:19:46,770
And I think the worry
in the United States

1653
01:19:46,770 --> 01:19:49,070
is that if there's another
mass casualty terrorist

1654
01:19:49,070 --> 01:19:53,180
attack in India, how
will the BJP-- now

1655
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:56,740
you have a new prime minister
who is, by all accounts,

1656
01:19:56,740 --> 01:19:59,890
a little more aggressive than
his predecessors, a little more

1657
01:19:59,890 --> 01:20:01,200
hawkish.

1658
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:06,100
And right now, the
stability in South Asia

1659
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:08,230
is predicated on Indian
restraint following

1660
01:20:08,230 --> 01:20:10,530
one of these mass casualty
terrorist attacks.

1661
01:20:10,530 --> 01:20:14,625
So if there's another Bombay,
how will the BJP respond?

1662
01:20:16,609 --> 01:20:18,650
We can talk-- if anybody
has heard of Cold Start,

1663
01:20:18,650 --> 01:20:19,330
we talk about that.

1664
01:20:19,330 --> 01:20:21,246
You guys can all email
me if anyone ever wants

1665
01:20:21,246 --> 01:20:22,510
to get into some of the weeds.

1666
01:20:22,510 --> 01:20:27,840
But the basic idea is India
has conventional superiority.

1667
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:30,510
It has not used it yet.

1668
01:20:30,510 --> 01:20:33,370
There's some belief that
Pakistan's nuclear threat is

1669
01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:35,760
a bluff and that
India could execute

1670
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:38,990
certain conventional objectives
below the nuclear threshold.

1671
01:20:38,990 --> 01:20:39,830
Maybe, maybe not.

1672
01:20:39,830 --> 01:20:40,800
It's pretty risky.

1673
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:43,030
Particularly, we talk about
tactical nuclear weapons

1674
01:20:43,030 --> 01:20:44,488
that would, at
least at some point,

1675
01:20:44,488 --> 01:20:48,540
be devolved to the
brigadier level maybe.

1676
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:52,920
And so you'll have-- it's not
just one nuclear threshold,

1677
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:54,590
but nine.

1678
01:20:54,590 --> 01:20:56,187
And so you have
to worry about one

1679
01:20:56,187 --> 01:20:57,770
of them deciding
that this is the end,

1680
01:20:57,770 --> 01:20:59,370
and they use nuclear weapons.

1681
01:20:59,370 --> 01:21:03,430
I think the Pakistani strategy
is actually quite rational.

1682
01:21:03,430 --> 01:21:06,089
It's deterring with
the rational threatened

1683
01:21:06,089 --> 01:21:07,880
that we might use
tactical nuclear weapons,

1684
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:09,535
but also through a
madman mechanism.

1685
01:21:09,535 --> 01:21:11,160
We're going to develop
nuclear weapons,

1686
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:13,576
and hey, one of our brigadiers
might use them if you come.

1687
01:21:13,576 --> 01:21:17,770
And that reinforces the rational
deterrent threat as well.

1688
01:21:17,770 --> 01:21:22,860
And so, so far, both
in Kargil-- sorry.

1689
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:27,460
In three instances, Kargil,
Parakram, and Bombay,

1690
01:21:27,460 --> 01:21:30,470
India has relatively restrained
its conventional retaliation

1691
01:21:30,470 --> 01:21:31,800
and its response.

1692
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:36,300
And so far, that has
taken India and Pakistan

1693
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:38,504
off the escalatory highway.

1694
01:21:38,504 --> 01:21:40,920
But it's no guarantee that
that'll continue going forward.

1695
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:45,400
I think the emotions in India
are running very high vis-a-vis

1696
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:46,420
Pakistan.

1697
01:21:46,420 --> 01:21:48,260
Particularly, there's
increased shelling

1698
01:21:48,260 --> 01:21:51,330
across the line of control
in the past several months.

1699
01:21:51,330 --> 01:21:54,940
And if there's a significant
attack in a major city that

1700
01:21:54,940 --> 01:21:57,660
involves the death of
many Indian civilians,

1701
01:21:57,660 --> 01:22:00,830
there'll be a lot of pressure
on Prime Minister Modi

1702
01:22:00,830 --> 01:22:02,690
to do something about it.

1703
01:22:02,690 --> 01:22:05,030
And then all bets are
off because you'll

1704
01:22:05,030 --> 01:22:06,640
have nuclear weapons
potentially mixed

1705
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:08,849
with conventional
conflict, and that

1706
01:22:08,849 --> 01:22:10,140
would be the escalation ladder.

1707
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:11,598
I think that's
something that we're

1708
01:22:11,598 --> 01:22:14,415
likely-- it's this element of
terrorist attack mass casualty

1709
01:22:14,415 --> 01:22:16,790
terrorist attacks that didn't
exist in the Cold War, that

1710
01:22:16,790 --> 01:22:19,510
makes South Asia quite
different, I think,

1711
01:22:19,510 --> 01:22:22,520
from the US and Soviet balance.

1712
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:24,480
And so it's that
combination of proxy forces

1713
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:28,870
and the arms race that, I think,
makes it particularly unstable.

1714
01:22:28,870 --> 01:22:30,010
So I'm going to stop there.

1715
01:22:30,010 --> 01:22:31,300
We are almost out
of time, but I'm

1716
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:32,570
happy to take
questions for a while

1717
01:22:32,570 --> 01:22:34,100
if anybody has any further
thoughts or anything.

1718
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:34,420
Yeah?

1719
01:22:34,420 --> 01:22:36,586
AUDIENCE: Does Pakistan
have strategic weapons aimed

1720
01:22:36,586 --> 01:22:37,494
at Indian cities or--

1721
01:22:37,494 --> 01:22:38,410
VIPIN NARANG: It does.

1722
01:22:38,410 --> 01:22:39,050
Yeah.

1723
01:22:39,050 --> 01:22:41,039
AUDIENCE: --weapon
also reach [INAUDIBLE].

1724
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:41,830
VIPIN NARANG: Yeah.

1725
01:22:41,830 --> 01:22:46,650
So this gets into a concept
known as escalation dominance.

1726
01:22:46,650 --> 01:22:50,360
Pakistan also has
strategic weapons

1727
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:54,120
that put most of India's
matrices in reach.

1728
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:57,330
The idea being that that
deters Indian retaliation

1729
01:22:57,330 --> 01:22:59,065
for tactical
nuclear-- so Pakistan

1730
01:22:59,065 --> 01:23:01,420
views tactical nuclear
use as a war terminating

1731
01:23:01,420 --> 01:23:03,430
strategy because of
the strategic weapons.

1732
01:23:03,430 --> 01:23:05,180
So the idea is if any
conventional forces

1733
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:07,740
attack, Pakistan stands
and fights conventionally.

1734
01:23:07,740 --> 01:23:08,240
Fine.

1735
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:08,690
They start losing.

1736
01:23:08,690 --> 01:23:10,980
They use tactical nuclear
weapons on Indian forces.

1737
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:12,980
But now I have a secure
second strike capability

1738
01:23:12,980 --> 01:23:14,210
also if I'm Pakistan.

1739
01:23:14,210 --> 01:23:17,750
So India has no incentive to use
its strategic nuclear weapons

1740
01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:23,770
against Pakistani cities because
nuclear use on your forces

1741
01:23:23,770 --> 01:23:26,680
operating on Pakistani soil,
that's already happened.

1742
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:29,630
Am I willing to risk Delhi
and Bombay for retaliating.

1743
01:23:29,630 --> 01:23:30,624
Probably not.

1744
01:23:30,624 --> 01:23:32,790
Now absent the strategic
capabilities, you're right.

1745
01:23:32,790 --> 01:23:34,950
Then, India could
easily retaliate,

1746
01:23:34,950 --> 01:23:38,062
and there would be no
reciprocation from Pakistan.

1747
01:23:38,062 --> 01:23:39,520
But Pakistan is
trying to establish

1748
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:42,237
what it calls escalation
dominance so that it could

1749
01:23:42,237 --> 01:23:43,820
use tactical nuclear
weapons, and that

1750
01:23:43,820 --> 01:23:44,778
would be the end of it.

1751
01:23:44,778 --> 01:23:46,760
So India would have no
incentive to retaliate

1752
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:48,950
with strategic nuclear
weapons against Pakistan.

1753
01:23:48,950 --> 01:23:50,658
There is some belief
that India's looking

1754
01:23:50,658 --> 01:23:53,350
at lower order use options.

1755
01:23:53,350 --> 01:23:55,371
India has no tactical
nuclear weapons itself.

1756
01:23:55,371 --> 01:23:56,870
But there are some
capabilities that

1757
01:23:56,870 --> 01:24:01,370
could be used for softer
targets than just cities.

1758
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:04,510
And it may be that
India tries to develop

1759
01:24:04,510 --> 01:24:05,900
tit-for-tat capabilities.

1760
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:11,580
And then that's basically your
escalation ladder as well.

1761
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:12,290
In the back?

1762
01:24:12,290 --> 01:24:14,250
AUDIENCE: So if
India is so paralyzed

1763
01:24:14,250 --> 01:24:18,170
and Pakistan realizes
this, why hasn't Pakistan

1764
01:24:18,170 --> 01:24:20,587
increase the
frequency of attack?

1765
01:24:20,587 --> 01:24:23,170
VIPIN NARANG: I think part of
it is you can't do it too often.

1766
01:24:23,170 --> 01:24:25,500
You do it too often, and
then the core world opinion--

1767
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:29,110
I think there's a limit to
how often you can do it.

1768
01:24:29,110 --> 01:24:32,460
But once every two, three
years is not nothing.

1769
01:24:32,460 --> 01:24:34,830
And there's always chatter.

1770
01:24:34,830 --> 01:24:37,687
There have been several
instances where the Indian home

1771
01:24:37,687 --> 01:24:40,270
ministry claims-- now, I don't
know how good the evidence is--

1772
01:24:40,270 --> 01:24:46,400
that they've disrupted several
attacks by LeT on Indians--

1773
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:48,720
on India.

1774
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:54,350
But every several years, I
think that's not nothing.

1775
01:24:54,350 --> 01:25:01,900
And they also choose relatively
strategic moments to do it.

1776
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:08,130
So if you look at the timing of
the attack on the parliament,

1777
01:25:08,130 --> 01:25:11,410
two months after 9/11, just as
the Pakistani US relationship

1778
01:25:11,410 --> 01:25:12,665
is growing again.

1779
01:25:12,665 --> 01:25:14,290
Maybe there's a belief
you can get away

1780
01:25:14,290 --> 01:25:18,300
with it because the US
is going to protect you.

1781
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:25,460
The Bombay attack was just
as then President Musharraf

1782
01:25:25,460 --> 01:25:28,740
was-- there was discussion
of concluding a back channel

1783
01:25:28,740 --> 01:25:31,380
final agreement over Kashmir.

1784
01:25:31,380 --> 01:25:35,290
And the LeT and the
India-focused militants

1785
01:25:35,290 --> 01:25:38,160
acted as veto
players, as spoilers.

1786
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:40,930
And so there was
a comp-- something

1787
01:25:40,930 --> 01:25:43,260
known as the composite
dialogue ongoing between India

1788
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:47,470
and Pakistan in 2008 where
literally everybody knew

1789
01:25:47,470 --> 01:25:50,700
what the final solution peace
deal between India and Pakistan

1790
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:51,200
would like.

1791
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:54,010
And President Musharraf
was very serious about it.

1792
01:25:54,010 --> 01:25:56,754
This was spoilers within
Pakistan vetoing that deal

1793
01:25:56,754 --> 01:25:57,920
and disrupting the dialogue.

1794
01:25:57,920 --> 01:25:59,880
So India had no option
but to terminate

1795
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:02,230
the composite
dialogue after Bombay.

1796
01:26:02,230 --> 01:26:03,860
And it hasn't really restarted.

1797
01:26:03,860 --> 01:26:06,800
And so those strategic
moments, I think,

1798
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:13,380
are chosen by Pakistani
militants to attack India.

1799
01:26:13,380 --> 01:26:13,880
Yes, sir?

1800
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:17,544
So what's the story-- I've heard
bits and pieces about Khan.

1801
01:26:17,544 --> 01:26:18,414
How did he evolve?

1802
01:26:18,414 --> 01:26:19,372
Where did he come from?

1803
01:26:19,372 --> 01:26:21,140
What was--

1804
01:26:21,140 --> 01:26:29,176
VIPIN NARANG: Yes, so that's
a whole other-- AQ Khan,

1805
01:26:29,176 --> 01:26:30,050
he stole the designs.

1806
01:26:30,050 --> 01:26:32,240
He provided the uranium
enrichment capability

1807
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:34,180
to Pakistan.

1808
01:26:34,180 --> 01:26:39,180
He orchestrated a network
of global suppliers

1809
01:26:39,180 --> 01:26:40,940
for the components
for the centrifuges,

1810
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:43,710
which he then leveraged
for both state policy.

1811
01:26:43,710 --> 01:26:47,100
So he used that network
to get North Korea

1812
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:50,640
its centrifuge capability.

1813
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:55,190
But whether, with complicit
state support or acting

1814
01:26:55,190 --> 01:26:57,650
on his own, he also
decided to make

1815
01:26:57,650 --> 01:27:01,070
some money by moonlighting,
maybe, with Iran and Libya.

1816
01:27:01,070 --> 01:27:03,262
And there's believed to
be a fourth customer.

1817
01:27:03,262 --> 01:27:04,220
Don't know who that is.

1818
01:27:04,220 --> 01:27:07,650
But there's a big debate also in
the Pakistan nuclear community

1819
01:27:07,650 --> 01:27:09,930
about how influential
AQ Khan really was.

1820
01:27:09,930 --> 01:27:13,280
I mean they're moving to the
plutonium designs anyway.

1821
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:17,450
PAEC, which is the Pakistan
Atomic Energy Commission.

1822
01:27:17,450 --> 01:27:22,500
They're responsible for
plutonium production pathway.

1823
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:27,210
They're competing for
designs and for ownership

1824
01:27:27,210 --> 01:27:28,320
of the Pakistani program.

1825
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:31,936
So in Pakistan, he
still-- he claims

1826
01:27:31,936 --> 01:27:33,560
to be the father of
the Pakistani bomb.

1827
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:34,476
That's up for dispute.

1828
01:27:34,476 --> 01:27:39,767
But some of the
proliferation activities, it

1829
01:27:39,767 --> 01:27:41,600
is unclear whether they
were state sponsored

1830
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:43,800
or whether there was
some state complicity,

1831
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:46,258
and he just acted on his own
or whether he acted completely

1832
01:27:46,258 --> 01:27:46,974
on his own.

1833
01:27:46,974 --> 01:27:49,522
AUDIENCE: But he served this
thing, I mean is it true?

1834
01:27:49,522 --> 01:27:52,366
I mean did he have this
business that basically

1835
01:27:52,366 --> 01:27:56,039
sells nuclear technology to
anyone who will pay the money?

1836
01:27:56,039 --> 01:27:57,580
VIPIN NARANG: I
mean, like I said-- I

1837
01:27:57,580 --> 01:28:02,230
mean he-- there was a catalog.

1838
01:28:02,230 --> 01:28:05,280
You could get a
brochure for-- yeah.

1839
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:10,370
And so it is true
that there was--

1840
01:28:10,370 --> 01:28:14,060
he definitely had really
significant dealings

1841
01:28:14,060 --> 01:28:17,230
with Iran, which is interesting
because Iran and Pakistan

1842
01:28:17,230 --> 01:28:19,870
aren't natural allies--
are the ones who made Shia,

1843
01:28:19,870 --> 01:28:26,060
Sunni-- they're not natural.

1844
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:29,845
Iran has also been involved
with the Balochistan insurgency

1845
01:28:29,845 --> 01:28:30,800
in Pakistan.

1846
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:33,590
So that he would sell
centrifuges to Iran

1847
01:28:33,590 --> 01:28:34,590
seems a little puzzling.

1848
01:28:34,590 --> 01:28:36,673
May be it was for-- seems
like personal gain would

1849
01:28:36,673 --> 01:28:38,590
be a very strong explanation.

1850
01:28:41,370 --> 01:28:44,050
There's some evidence
that he approached Iraq

1851
01:28:44,050 --> 01:28:49,150
in the late 1980s to see if
they're interested in uranium

1852
01:28:49,150 --> 01:28:49,740
enrichment.

1853
01:28:49,740 --> 01:28:53,600
Saddam Hussein thought it was
a trap, so he passed on it.

1854
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:55,660
But, yeah, I mean
there's no question

1855
01:28:55,660 --> 01:28:58,276
that there was-- this is a
big nonproliferation failure.

1856
01:28:58,276 --> 01:28:59,776
AUDIENCE: I can't
remember if I read

1857
01:28:59,776 --> 01:29:05,958
about it on [INAUDIBLE]
media or [INAUDIBLE],

1858
01:29:05,958 --> 01:29:07,422
but I remember
reading about this.

1859
01:29:07,422 --> 01:29:11,330
And what they said was that he
was doing it for personal gain.

1860
01:29:11,330 --> 01:29:12,530
VIPIN NARANG: Yeah, there's no
question he made a lot of money

1861
01:29:12,530 --> 01:29:12,650
from it.

1862
01:29:12,650 --> 01:29:14,400
But you would have to
leverage some assets

1863
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:16,676
from Pakistan military
to do some of this stuff.

1864
01:29:16,676 --> 01:29:18,550
There's no way that they
didn't-- some people

1865
01:29:18,550 --> 01:29:20,980
didn't know about unless
they were in on the take,

1866
01:29:20,980 --> 01:29:22,669
which is entirely possible.

1867
01:29:22,669 --> 01:29:24,460
I mean I find it hard--
certainly the North

1868
01:29:24,460 --> 01:29:27,200
Korean deal, I mean they
flew Pakistani C-17,

1869
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:31,704
so it was military transport
that took the first centrifuge

1870
01:29:31,704 --> 01:29:32,870
cascade over to North Korea.

1871
01:29:32,870 --> 01:29:34,370
So that was definitely
state to state.

1872
01:29:34,370 --> 01:29:35,953
Some of the other
stuff is just really

1873
01:29:35,953 --> 01:29:37,810
murky as to the level
of state complicity.

1874
01:29:37,810 --> 01:29:38,900
Were there people in
the Pakistan government

1875
01:29:38,900 --> 01:29:39,910
who knew he was doing it.

1876
01:29:39,910 --> 01:29:41,630
I'd probably-- it would be hard
for me to believe that they

1877
01:29:41,630 --> 01:29:42,520
didn't.

1878
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:45,990
But it may not have
been state policy.

1879
01:29:45,990 --> 01:29:46,850
Yes, sir?

1880
01:29:46,850 --> 01:29:48,706
Last question, I
think, then we got to--

1881
01:29:48,706 --> 01:29:52,650
So I think that the
influence of the US support

1882
01:29:52,650 --> 01:29:54,129
is, perhaps, understated.

1883
01:29:54,129 --> 01:29:59,552
If we ignored Pakistan,
didn't like them anymore,

1884
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:03,496
and the entire international
community turned on them,

1885
01:30:03,496 --> 01:30:05,961
it might be devastating
for them, especially

1886
01:30:05,961 --> 01:30:08,679
economic sanctions [INAUDIBLE].

1887
01:30:08,679 --> 01:30:10,720
VIPIN NARANG: So we imposed
sanctions after 1998.

1888
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:14,000
But then after September
11, we needed Pakistan.

1889
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,920
AUDIENCE: How long
will we need them?

1890
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:17,745
[INAUDIBLE]

1891
01:30:17,745 --> 01:30:19,870
VIPIN NARANG: There are a
couple good books on this

1892
01:30:19,870 --> 01:30:20,490
out recently.

1893
01:30:20,490 --> 01:30:21,590
I'm not a Pakistan expert.

1894
01:30:21,590 --> 01:30:25,220
And this gets into very
like-- the empirical evidence

1895
01:30:25,220 --> 01:30:29,017
for this is-- we don't know.

1896
01:30:29,017 --> 01:30:30,600
But Pakistan could
be very vulnerable.

1897
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:34,740
I mean I think a nontrivial
proportion of their revenue

1898
01:30:34,740 --> 01:30:37,370
comes from US and
international aid.

1899
01:30:37,370 --> 01:30:43,480
But on the other hand,
given the militancy problem,

1900
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:46,910
I think most countries
prefer a stable Pakistan

1901
01:30:46,910 --> 01:30:48,000
to an unstable Pakistan.

1902
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,210
And heavy sanctions
could really disrupt

1903
01:30:51,210 --> 01:30:52,320
the fabric of that state.

1904
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:56,434
And say so it's a very
thin line you walk.

1905
01:30:56,434 --> 01:30:58,850
And part of it is, I think the
opportunity that the United

1906
01:30:58,850 --> 01:31:00,720
States had was in the 1980s.

1907
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:01,995
And there was a belief in
the Reagan administration

1908
01:31:01,995 --> 01:31:03,203
that it was one or the other.

1909
01:31:03,203 --> 01:31:06,740
It was either we needed to
Pakistan against the Sovs

1910
01:31:06,740 --> 01:31:07,930
or it's the nuclear program.

1911
01:31:07,930 --> 01:31:10,640
But we couldn't deal with
both at the same time.

1912
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:12,432
The United states wasn't happy.

1913
01:31:12,432 --> 01:31:14,890
It wasn't like the US was happy
about the Pakistani nuclear

1914
01:31:14,890 --> 01:31:16,790
program.

1915
01:31:16,790 --> 01:31:19,220
But it is certainly
true that the executive

1916
01:31:19,220 --> 01:31:20,687
was willing to
look the other way

1917
01:31:20,687 --> 01:31:22,520
and tolerate certain
movement up to a point,

1918
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:23,930
probably on the belief
that it was inevitable.

1919
01:31:23,930 --> 01:31:25,510
There's nothing much
you can do about it.

1920
01:31:25,510 --> 01:31:26,280
I'm not sure if that's true.

1921
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:28,560
I actually think that there were
a lot of leverage points we--

1922
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:30,454
the United States could
have had in the 1980s

1923
01:31:30,454 --> 01:31:31,870
and didn't take
advantage of them.

1924
01:31:31,870 --> 01:31:34,530
But that's also--
an administration

1925
01:31:34,530 --> 01:31:36,780
fighting this war may not
believe it has the bandwidth

1926
01:31:36,780 --> 01:31:38,080
to deal with both.

1927
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:39,712
And I think that's
where they ended up.

1928
01:31:39,712 --> 01:31:42,170
But if there was ever a point,
it was probably in the 1980s

1929
01:31:42,170 --> 01:31:44,849
to stop Pakistan from
becoming a nuclear state

1930
01:31:44,849 --> 01:31:45,640
in the first place.

1931
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:47,640
But now that they
are, it's really hard

1932
01:31:47,640 --> 01:31:49,272
to see what we can do.

1933
01:31:49,272 --> 01:31:51,150
Aaron, yeah?

1934
01:31:51,150 --> 01:31:56,100
AUDIENCE: There is an overall
question here, which is tough.

1935
01:31:56,100 --> 01:31:59,070
I mean it's a very
unstable situation

1936
01:31:59,070 --> 01:32:02,040
between India and Pakistan.

1937
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:05,505
And you either keep
going from them

1938
01:32:05,505 --> 01:32:09,960
leading the way it has been
going, or you take a big step.

1939
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:13,425
And the big step
is either you're

1940
01:32:13,425 --> 01:32:17,649
going to do something
war-like or peace-like.

1941
01:32:17,649 --> 01:32:20,094
And there is a
peace-like thing which

1942
01:32:20,094 --> 01:32:24,495
never seems to surface,
which is, look,

1943
01:32:24,495 --> 01:32:29,063
if you can't solve
this by war-like steps,

1944
01:32:29,063 --> 01:32:31,839
then you have to solve
it by eliminating

1945
01:32:31,839 --> 01:32:34,284
the political tension.

1946
01:32:34,284 --> 01:32:38,685
And that doesn't seem
to be possible in India.

1947
01:32:38,685 --> 01:32:44,553
India is this world power,
and why don't they stand up--

1948
01:32:44,553 --> 01:32:46,020
what's your analysis?

1949
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:48,220
Why don't they stand
up and say, we're

1950
01:32:48,220 --> 01:32:51,245
not going to solve this
militarily so we better--

1951
01:32:51,245 --> 01:32:53,620
VIPIN NARANG: I think there
was a real golden opportunity

1952
01:32:53,620 --> 01:32:54,460
in 2008.

1953
01:32:54,460 --> 01:32:57,360
I think Manmohan Singh and then
foreign secretary Shivshankar

1954
01:32:57,360 --> 01:32:59,510
Menon who's going to
be at MIT actually

1955
01:32:59,510 --> 01:33:04,440
in February at the Center
for National Studies with us,

1956
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:06,070
he can give more
insight on this.

1957
01:33:06,070 --> 01:33:12,100
But I believe India was
ready to do that in 2008.

1958
01:33:12,100 --> 01:33:16,520
And Musharraf was ready
to do this in 2008.

1959
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:21,620
Certain elements of the
Pakistani security services

1960
01:33:21,620 --> 01:33:24,130
and their proxy forces
and the LeT were not.

1961
01:33:24,130 --> 01:33:27,070
And so it was just
politically untenable,

1962
01:33:27,070 --> 01:33:30,790
after the Bombay attack, for
the Indian political leadership.

1963
01:33:30,790 --> 01:33:32,984
And so the spoilers--
the spoilers spoiled.

1964
01:33:32,984 --> 01:33:34,650
AUDIENCE: They spoiled
it, but the point

1965
01:33:34,650 --> 01:33:37,830
is that that was the
point to stand up,

1966
01:33:37,830 --> 01:33:43,289
and probably again
because you're in a bind.

1967
01:33:43,289 --> 01:33:45,080
VIPIN NARANG: But I
mean the politics of it

1968
01:33:45,080 --> 01:33:46,000
was just too-- I
mean there's just

1969
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,455
no way that that
government could

1970
01:33:47,455 --> 01:33:51,640
have survived if it continued
with a composite dialogue.

1971
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:57,150
And it was also a case
where there were facing--

1972
01:33:57,150 --> 01:33:59,550
elections were the next year.

1973
01:33:59,550 --> 01:34:01,740
There was no way that the
composite dialogue could

1974
01:34:01,740 --> 01:34:02,560
have continued after bombing.

1975
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:03,601
No country could do that.

1976
01:34:03,601 --> 01:34:04,900
No political leadership could.

1977
01:34:04,900 --> 01:34:07,540
It's just unfortunate-- the
unfortunate nature of politics.

1978
01:34:07,540 --> 01:34:09,960
And I think the LeT knew that.

1979
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:11,510
You perpetrate this
attack, and you

1980
01:34:11,510 --> 01:34:13,968
will kill the composite dialogue
and the back channel talk.

1981
01:34:13,968 --> 01:34:16,220
And that's exactly
what happened.

1982
01:34:16,220 --> 01:34:18,880
It may be-- it's interesting
because sometimes you

1983
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:21,890
need a Nixon and
China moment, and Modi

1984
01:34:21,890 --> 01:34:24,315
who is hawkish in the BJP,
he has the credibility

1985
01:34:24,315 --> 01:34:27,207
to get the right on his side.

1986
01:34:27,207 --> 01:34:29,290
He's protect on his right
flank, which often tends

1987
01:34:29,290 --> 01:34:31,110
to be the spoiler in India.

1988
01:34:31,110 --> 01:34:32,667
So he has an
opportunity, I think.

1989
01:34:32,667 --> 01:34:35,250
And I wouldn't be surprised if
there's some movement toward it

1990
01:34:35,250 --> 01:34:38,160
in the administration provided
there are no other attacks.

1991
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:39,795
So I think you're right.

1992
01:34:39,795 --> 01:34:41,170
All the piecess--
everybody knows

1993
01:34:41,170 --> 01:34:43,150
what the final deal looks like.

1994
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:48,240
There's one hiccup
about whether it's

1995
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:50,950
sequential or simultaneous
demilitarization

1996
01:34:50,950 --> 01:34:53,090
of the Siachen [INAUDIBLE]
or like minor things.

1997
01:34:53,090 --> 01:34:54,190
I mean those are solvable.

1998
01:34:54,190 --> 01:34:55,280
But everything else,
the line of control

1999
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:57,210
becomes a de facto
national border.

2000
01:34:57,210 --> 01:34:59,690
Everything else
gets adjudicated.

2001
01:34:59,690 --> 01:35:03,681
And maybe-- Modi has five
years, so it's possible.

2002
01:35:03,681 --> 01:35:05,222
If anyone in India
can do it, I think

2003
01:35:05,222 --> 01:35:06,825
it has to be somebody
from the right.

2004
01:35:06,825 --> 01:35:08,950
The question is whether
there's a willing partner--

2005
01:35:08,950 --> 01:35:09,250
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

2006
01:35:09,250 --> 01:35:11,125
VIPIN NARANG: --willing
partners on Pakistan.

2007
01:35:11,125 --> 01:35:12,890
Exactly.

2008
01:35:12,890 --> 01:35:14,336
OK, I think we're over time.

2009
01:35:14,336 --> 01:35:16,460
So we should-- I gotta pick
up my kid from daycare,

2010
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:19,650
so thank you guys.

2011
01:35:19,650 --> 01:35:21,200
Thanks!
