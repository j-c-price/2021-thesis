was mentioning\nbefore we started,\nthis year's Nobel\nPrize was given\nto John O'Keefe, who\ndiscovered the properties\nof individual neurons\nin the hippocampus\nby applying these\nmethods for recording\nthe discharge of\nsingle cells by putting\nlittle wires into the brain--\nso-called extracellular\nrecordings.\nYou put in a wire.\nThe tip of the electrode can\nrecord electrical discharge\nof cells.\nYou measure the\ndischarge of cells\nas animals move around in space.\nAnd you try to figure out what\nthis part of the brain does.\nNow where the observation\npart of science\ncomes in in this\ncase is interesting,\nbecause it relates to another\naspect of neuroscience.\nAnd that is the relationship\nbetween the neurobiology\nand behavior.\nAnd this is an approach known\nas a neuroethological approach.\nAnd that's studying\nthe brain systems\nin the context in which they\nactually evolve and were used.\nAnd so that could apply\nto the use of song\nas a mechanism of\ncommunication in birds.\nIt can come from\nthe finding prey\nin the dark, when it comes\nsound-localization owls.\nIn the case of rodents,\nO'Keefe appreciated the fact\nthat the hippocampus\nin rodents really\nhas a primary role in\nspatial navigation--\nthat animals that have\ndamaged the hippocampus\nhave problems with\nspatial navigation.\nAnd the hippocampus\nhad been studied up\nto that point using animals\nthat were head-fixed.\nSo you take a little rat.\nYou fix his head.\nAnd the reason for\nfixing its head\nis for convenience,\nlargely, so that when\nyou place these little\nelectrodes into the brain,\nthe animal doesn't move.\nThey don't move.\nElectrode moves, you\ncan't get good recordings.\nSo you need to keep\nthe preparation fixed.\nSo you fix the animal's head.\nThen you figure out\nways to actually\nlook, to study the system\ngiven the constraints\nof the methodology.\nAnd that involved, largely,\nbefore John O'Keefe in 1970,\nusing methods of\nclassical conditioning.\nSo you might be familiar\nwith basic learning theory.\nAnd how do we learn\nhow to do things?\nWell, it's basically\nchaining together\nstimulus response associations.\nYou see something,\nyou do something,\nyou get rewarded for doing that.\nYou're more likely to do\nthat again in the future.\nThis is a basic\nPavlovian conditioning.\nI ring a bell, you get food.\nYou associate bell\nwith the food.\nAnd so that was the thinking--\nthat all of cognition\ncan be built up from basic\nstimulus-response associations.\nBut there was a\nmovement around the time\nthat O'Keefe was\ndoing this work that\nproposed that that\nwas insufficient--\nthat simple behavioral simple\nstimulus response learning was\ninsufficient, that\nthere was some kind\nof internal foundation upon\nwhich learning was applied.\nAnd this was the\nso-called cognitive theory\nof learning and memory.\nAnd the hippocampus\nwas posited beta-site\nof one property of\nthis cognitive learning\nas applied to space.\nAnd the observation was\nactually a fairly simple one.\nIf you take a rat--\nI see you want to\nlearn something.\nThat is, if you want to learn\nto associate a cue with food\nor you want to train it to go\nover and press a lever for food\nor-- you want it\nto learn something,\nand you do this\nin an environment\nand put it in a box.\nWell, if you take a rat\nand you put it in that box,\nlet's say, the day before,\nand just let it wander around.\nIt does nothing.\nIt just explores space.\nYou take it out.\nAnd now we take two rats-- one\nthat's been in the box before\nand one that has not\nbeen in the box before--\nand the rat that\nhas been in the box\nbefore will learn faster\nthan the animal has not\nbeen in the box.\nAnd you say, why would just\npassive exposure to that box\nenhance it's learning?\nAnd this phenomena is\nknown as latent learning.\nThe animal had learned\nsomething that it could then\napply to this new learning even\nthough it was not instructive.\nIt wasn't rewarded for doing\nanything, it just explored.\nAnd so this idea that there was\nsome sort of latent capacity\nto enhance learning\nwas motivated\nthe study of the\nhippocampus in the context\nof non-head-fixed recording.\nAnd so it keeps real inside.\nIn fact, the paper that was\ncited for the Nobel Prize\nwas the paper in which he first\nrecorded from these cells--\nand all he did was just take\nthe animals out of the ear bars.\nSo he took the animal\nout of the ear bars\nand just let it run around on\na tabletop, just like this,\nactually.\nIt was a table at the\nUniversity College\nLondon about this size where\nthe rat just kind of wandered\naround.\nAnd he made observations-- oh,\nhere's a cell that fires when\nthe animal goes over\nto the left hand side--\nvery descriptive,\nbut the key insight\nwas to study the\nhippocampus when rats are\ndoing what rats normally do--\nexplore in space.\nSo it was this\nethological approach.\nAnd what he discovered was that\ncells in the hippocampus.--\nand this is a cross-section.\nThe hippocampus is found here.\nIt's in the medial\ntemporal lobes.\nThe name hippocampus comes\nfrom the Greek for seahorse,\nso in humans, it sort of\nlooks like a seahorse.\nThe regions here--\nthe terminology CA,\nthese different fields\nof the hippocampus,\ncomes from cornu\nammonis, or Amman's horn.\nThat's because it looks\nlike a ram's horn.\nSo if you think about it,\nit's like little ram's horns\nright here, put them\nin the temporal lobes\nand you move them\nin there, that's\nwhere your hippocampus is.\nJust like this.\nAnd if you make a cross-section,\nslice through that,\nthis is the circuit.\nSo information comes in\nfrom across the brain,\nconverges in the primary\ninput to the hippocampus--\nthat's called entorhinal cortex,\nwhich is what the other Nobel\nPrize was awarded to--\nthe husband and wife team that\nhad discovered and identified\nthe properties of cells\nin the entorhinal cortex,\nthese so-called grid cells\nthat seem to carry information\nabout actual, it seemed\nlike, Cartesian-like spatial\ninformation conveyed\nin the hippocampus.\nSo stuff comes in from the\nrest of the brain, converges\nin the entorhinal cortex,\nand then goes around\nthis little loop, from these\nthree primary subfields--\nthe dentate gyrus, CA cornu\nammonis 3, CA1, subiculum,\nand back on again.\nSo it goes through this loop.\nClassically, it had\nbeen referred to\nas the trisynaptic loop.\nOne synapse, dentate, CA3,\nCA1, and then back out.\nAnd again, recordings in\nthis part of the hippocampus\nreveal the properties\nwhich I'll mention,\nand that is that the cells\nrespond to locations in space."], "480": [2, 140, "this electrophysiological\nwork in rodents--\nthere had been human\nneuropsychological work,\nin particular the seminal\ncase of the patient HM who\nhad been studied\nhere for many decades\nbefore he just\nrecently passed away.\nKnown as HM, or Henry Molaison,\nas he is sort of recently\nrevealed to be a patient who had\nundergone bilateral resection\nof medial temporal lobes.\nCut out parts of his\nhippocampus and other\nassociated medial\ntemporal lobe structures\nto treat intractable epilepsy.\nHe subsequently lost the ability\nto form any new memories.\nSo had permanent\nanterograde- couldn't\nform any new memories going\nforward in the future and lost\nsome of his older memories.\nSo you lose memories\nin humans, rodents\ncan't navigate in space, also\nhumans have a spatial deficit,\nso there's some connection\nbetween space and memory.\nAnd the question\nis, what is that?\nWhat would link spatial\nnavigation and memory?\nBut not just any\nkind of memory--\nwhat we refer to as\nepisodic memory-- memory\nfor events or experiences.\nAnd so the working hypothesis\nis that these two things\nare really connected by a\nneed, a computation imperative,\nto maintain information\nabout time order.\nAnd that is, if you're\ngoing to use experience\nto guide future\nbehavior, you need\nto figure out what the\ncausal relationships are\nbetween events in the world.\nIf I see A and B, what I\nreally want to figure out--\nI don't just want\nto record the fact\nthat A and B happen together.\nUltimately, I want\nto try to understand\nthe relationship between\nA and B. Did A cause B,\nor how might I actually\npredict B given A?\nAnd the way I\nwould do that would\nbe to construct some kind\nof simple internal model,\na predictive model, that's\nbased on experience.\nAnd so the idea is, hippocampus\ncaptures experience,\nand then sort through\nsome process, which we'll\nrefer to as the process\nof consolidation,\ntranslates experience into\nsome working model that\ncan predict events and can\nbe used to guide behavior\nin decision making.\nAnd critical to that\nis just the idea"], "620": [3, 130, "So as I mentioned, the use\nof very simple technology,\nin this case extracellular\nneurophysiological recording--\ntaking a tiny wire-- this wire\nis actually four small wires,\neach one about 10\nmicrons across.\nYou twist them together\nin a little bundle.\nThe bundle is about 35 microns.\nHuman hair is on the order of\ntypically about 50 microns,\nso these are wires, or\nmulti contact electrodes,\nabout as large as a human hair.\nWe thread these things\nthrough the little oil rig\ndrilling device here, which is--\nthese little micromanipulators\nallow this wire\nto be driven down through\nvery small guide cannula,\nand so out the bottom\nwill be a number\nof these independent\nindividual electrodes,\neach controlled by their\nown micromanipulator.\nSo we can send these\nelectrodes down--\nthis entire device,\nin this case,\nweighs anywhere\nfrom 12 to 20 grams,\nand this can be placed\non an animal's head\npermanently or chronically, and\nthat is that once it goes on,\nit doesn't come off.\nSo they will have this\nlittle helmet like thing\non their head, a small\nopening is made in the skull,\nthe wires are sent through, and\nthe whole surgical procedure\ntakes maybe 30 to 45 minutes.\nIt's like an outpatient thing.\nIt would probably\ntake longer to have\nyour wisdom teeth pulled than to\nhave a brain implant installed.\nBut then once this is\ninstalled, these electrodes\ncan be driven down and\nplaced permanently.\nIt gives you the ability\nto monitor pattern activity\nacross large populations\nover long periods of time--\ndays, weeks, months.\nSo you have tapped into\nactivity in this brain area,\nand you can monitor as animals\nexperience, learn, and recall.\nThis is what the\nraw data looks like.\nThis is a cartoon of the\nelectrode with four contacts."], "750": [4, 250, "it gives you the ability\nto triangulate location,\nmuch as you stereoscopically\ncan determine depth.\nThese four contacts\nwill give you\nthe ability to\ntriangulate things\nin three dimensional space.\nOne of the properties of this\nhippocampal circuit, and that\nis-- so this little\ncross-section-- you\nimagine a neuron here.\nAnd so there are\ngoing to be, again,\nneurons distributed\nacross the hippocampus.\nIn the rat, there are on\nthe order of maybe 200,000\ncells in area CA1.\nIn the entire hippocampus,\nthere are on the order of one\nto two million cells.\nAnd if you drop an electrode\nany place into the hippocampus,\nyou will find cells that have\nthis kind of spatial property.\nAnd so what that says is\nthat spatial information\nis distributed not\nin a topographic way.\nIn other words, it's not\none location in space\nis mapped into one location\nin the hippocampus.\nUnlike some of the sensory\nareas that have this kind\nof topography, for instance,\nif you record in the visual\ncortex, where there was there\nwould be some correspondence\nbetween location\nand visual field,\nand the location of cells in\nthe cortex that respond to that\nso-called retinotopic mapping--\nvisual field mapped\nonto the anatomy.\nSame thing with the\nsomatosensory system.\nAs I move and I touch\ndifferent parts of the body,\nthe cells that respond to\nthat will be mapped out\nin a largely one-to-one\ncorrespondence\nbetween the adjacency of\nstimuli in the input space\nand adjacency of\nthe representation\nin the neural space that does\nnot occur in the hippocampus.\nTwo cells that are right\nnext to one another\nare no more likely to respond\nto nearby locations in space\nthan two cells that are\ndistant from one another.\nSo, as we'll discuss,\nthe principle\nof information representation\nin the hippocampus\nappears to be one of kind of\nsparse distributed patterning,\nthat you have lots of\ncells that will respond\nto different environments\nand individual cells\ndon't have a unique\nrelationship to locations.\nIt's really the pattern\nacross cells that gives you\na unique signature of code.\nWe're taking\nadvantage of the fact\nthat you don't necessarily\nhave to place the electrodes\nat the proper place in\norder to get responses\nin some location in space.\nAnywhere you put these\nelectrodes in the hippocampus,\nyou're going to get\na certain fraction--\ngenerally about 30% of\nthe cells will respond\nin the given environment.\nAnd this is what those\nresponses look like.\nI won't go through the technical\ndetails, but, needless to say,\nthis just shows\nhow events, action\npotentials that are detected--\nin here, you see a voltage\ntrace, you pick out\nthe amplitude of these little\nvoltage transients generated\nby action potentials\nin the cells,\nyou plot the amplitude across\nthese different channels.\nIn this way, each point\nis an action potential,\nand what you see is that\nthe amplitudes will cluster\nin a way that reflect\nthe relative position\nor location of cells--\nthe sources relative\nto these wires,\nusing the basic principle that\nif you're closer to a wire,\nthe signal is going\nto get stronger.\nSo amplitude is essentially\ninversely related to distance.\nSo here, this is the amplitude\nof an action potential plot\nacross two channels.\nThese points are\nlarger on channel one,\nsmall on channel 2.\nThat means it's close to\nchannel 1, far from channel 2.\nAnd then different cells will\nhave different relations.\nThis will be large on channel 2,\nsmall on channel 1, et cetera.\nSo you can figure out where\nthese cells are in space,\nmeans you can pick out lots\nof cells from, in this case,"], "1000": [5, 30, "to 100 or more cells.\nAnd then looking at the\nactivity of those cells\nin a simple box--\nthis is just a little box, one\nwall removed, little ceiling\nof cubes, simple\narchitectural design,\nnice, clean and simple--\nwhat you get is clean and simple\nmapping of spatial locations\ninto these neural responses.\nSo each one of these panels\nrepresents the activity\nof individual cells."], "1030": [6, 170, "The color of the heat map\nindicates the firing rate\nof these individual cells.\nRed indicates high firing\nrate, blue indicates no firing.\nSo this is a top down\nview of that box.\nSo this cell, for instance, when\nthe animal is wandering around\nin the box, the cell is\nsilent in all the blue areas,\nand when it goes in the\nlower right hand corner,\nthe cell fires vigorously.\nSo silent, fires vigorously.\nThis one fires on\nthe left hand wall.\nThis one also fires on\nthe lower right hand side.\nSo this points out the\ncombinatorial nature\nof this spatial\nrepresentation, and that\nis that if the animal is\nin the lower right hand\ncorner of this\nparticular box, we'll\nget these two cells to fire.\nIf I take the animal and I\nput it into a different box,\nall of these responses\nwill be scrambled up.\nThere's nothing that\nsays this cell will\nfire in the lower right\nhand corner of another box.\nAnd certainly, even if it does\nfire in the lower right hand\ncorner, this other cell isn't\ngoing to fire along with it.\nAnd at any given location,\nthere are roughly 1% to 5%\nof the cells that are firing.\nSo at any given location, there\nare about maybe 5,000 cells\nin the hippocampus\nthat are active.\nSo the unique location and\nunique context and environments\ncan be conveyed across a unique\npattern of about 5,000 cells\nout of 100,000 or 200,000 cells.\nSo there's large\ncombinatorial space\nin which one can represent\nunique locations or potentially\neven unique experiences\nwithin different locations.\nYou see that many\ncells are silent.\nOn average, about\n30% of the cells\nrespond in any\ngiven environment.\nThe silent cells,\nas we'll see, they\ncan be detected when the\nanimals are not in a running\naround or experiencing space,\nbut when they're asleep\nor in these other\noffline states,\nwhen the hippocampus is actually\nthinking about other stuff.\nWe'll talk about that a bit.\nAnd then here, you can also see\na small number of these cells.\nIn this case, about 5%\nto 10% of these cells\nseem to have elevated firing\nrate across the entire space.\nThese are actually a\ndifferent class of neurons.\nThese are excitatory neurons.\nThese are inhibitory neurons.\nThe inhibition,\nthe idea that you\nhave circuits that can\nboth excite and inhibit,\nand that this is used\nas a circuit property\nto sculpt computation\nis something\nthat we'll also discuss.\nSo there's balance between\nexcitation as kind of a circuit\nprinciple that's used.\nInhibitory cells fire\nall over the place.\nThey're not really\ncommunicating information."], "1200": [7, 70, "And another property\nof these cells\nthat O'Keefe termed\nplace cells is that when\nanimals are constrained to move\nalong these limited paths--\nin this case, this is a linear\ntrack, as we refer to it.\nIt's like a little\ncorridor, and it\nwas moving down this corridor.\nWhen they move down a\ncorridor, cells don't only\nfire where the animal is, but\nalso in the direction that it's\ngoing.\nAnd so this is the\nfirst indication\nthese cells are not just--\nagain, it's not just a GPS.\nIt's not telling\nyou where you are.\nIt's at least telling\nyou where you're\ngoing, maybe what you're doing.\nSo here, if I look\nat this yellow cell,\nI can tell that the animal\nis not only in this location,\nbut it's moving down this\nlinear track in this direction.\nSo there's going to be a unique\nsequence when the animal walks\nalong this path--\nyellow cell, red\ncell, green cell.\nSo the different cells\nare color coded here.\nSo if you look over\ntime, you'll see\nthat there will be a\nunique sequence of activity\nin the hippocampus that reflects\nthe animal's actual behavior\nexperienced in that space.\nSo here, this is just a\nlittle movie that shows raw--\nthis is what you would\nactually see if you're"], "1270": [8, 80, "This is a little top down view.\nThe green circle just highlights\nwhere the rat actually is.\nThe color coding--\nthese are the cells\nthat we're picking up over here.\nThis is data as it would\nbe coming out of a set up.\nYou see, this light\nblue cell fires here,\nthe dark blue cell fires here.\nDark blue cell, light blue cell.\nSo this is the spatial\nfiring property, place cells.\nSo the animal has stopped.\nThe one thing you will notice--\nyou saw lots of activity,\nand animal stopped there, there\nwas this big burst of activity.\nHe'll stop again a\nlittle bit later.\nNow he's moving.\nNow when he's moving ,\nif you listen carefully,\nyou'll hear that there's\nthis background rhythm.\nThere's a modulation\nthat's going ch-ch-ch-ch.\nBackground modulation\nactivity which\nis associated with locomotion.\nSo there are really two modes--\nyou're actively engaged or when\nyou're taking information in,\nyou get this rhythm.\nWhen you're inattentive, not\nengaged, not taking information\nin, but internally\nevaluated, the rhythm\ngoes away and is replaced\nby these bursts of activity.\nAnd so these two modes,\nactive attentive--"], "1350": [9, 210, "you're evaluating information,\nyou're thinking about stuff--\ncan be reflected in these two\ncharacteristic modes, which\nyou can literally hear.\nYou can hear the\ndifference between the two.\nObviously, I've been listening\nto these things for a long time\nso it's very easy\nfor me to pick up.\nIt might be harder for you but,\nyou listen to it a little bit\nand it's very easy to\ndistinguish these two\ndifferent brain routes.\nSo this is going to be\nanother view of that data.\nSo same data, only now, instead\nof showing you the raw data,\nwhere is the firing.\nAnd that's one thing about this\ncorrelate that's so compelling.\nThat was literally raw\ndata as it was coming out.\nThere's no processing at all\nand you could see the correlate,\nyou can see the spatial\ncorrelate, which tells you,\nthis is not something\nthat requires\nI have to do\nmultiple regressions,\nand show you all of the--\ngive you some sort of\nstatistical confidence\nthat this is what the\nhippocampus is doing.\nYou can literally see\nit in individual cells.\nThe spatial correlate is\nextremely robust, compelling,\nand consistent.\nThose cells weren't selected.\nIf you record any of the\ncells in the hippocampus,\nthey're all doing that.\nThe estimate is that over\n95% of the cells that you\ncan record in rodent\nhippocampus will\nhave these spatial properties.\nSo it's really a fundamental\nproperty of this memory system.\nSo this is the same\ndata, except now,\ninstead of showing\nthe spiking, we're\ngoing to use this simple\nBayesian Estimation\nAlgorithm to ask the question.\n\"OK, if we know which\ncells are firing,\ncan we guess the location that\nthe animal would likely be?\"\nThat is, if we know the firing\nas a function of location,\nwe can use a Bayesian inference\nto guess the probability\nof location, given firing.\nAnd that's what we're\ngoing to do here.\nJust asking, if we know\nwhich cells are firing--\nfor instance, if the\nblue cell is firing,\nyou would say, \"Oh, the\nanimal's probably over here.\"\nSo recording across, looking\nat pattern across many cells,\nand then we're coming up\nevery 100 milliseconds,\nwe're coming up\nwith a probability\nthat that pattern could have\noccurred if the animal was\nat any location on this track.\nAnd the probability is going\nto be shown by a triangle.\nBig triangle means\nhigh probability.\nAnd what you'll see is,\nwhen we do this estimation,\nwhen the animal's moving,\nyou see the triangle.\nThe triangles are\nonly highly probable\nwhen the animal is\nactually moving,\nand only at the location\nthat the animal is.\nSo the hippocampus\nis centrally--\nthe hippocampus\nrepresentation is\ntracking the location the animal\nand also when the animal stops.\nNow, if you listen,\nyou heard the burst\nand you look at the triangle,\nwhen the animal stops,\nthe triangle no\nlonger corresponds\nto where the animal is.\nIn fact, when you\nget the burst, you\nsee the triangle jumping\naround the track.\nSo again, there's\nthese two modes\nand the representations\nhave these two properties.\nMoving, oscillation,\ntrack current location.\nStopping, oscillation goes\naway, representation now\njumps across the track.\nAnd interestingly, these\nlittle bursts, like that,\nalso occur, not just when\nthe animal stops briefly,\nbut when it actually\ngoes to sleep.\nSo here on the inset,\nthis is the animal now\nhas been taken off\nthe track altogether.\nIt's just sitting in a\nlittle box somewhere else,"], "1560": [10, 20, "You get these same bursts\nand when you decode activity,\nyou find you can decode\nthe position on the track\nand, if you look carefully, you\nsee that the position actually\nfollows a sequence of\ntrajectory along the track."], "1580": [11, 70, "So you think of there being\nthese two states, the offline\nand the online.\nAnd the online, when\nthe animal's moving,\nthe characteristic mode of\nactivity in the hippocampus\nis an oscillatory mode,\ndescribed as the theta rhythm,\nwhich is this 10\nhertz oscillation.\nWhen the animal\nstops and becomes\nquiet and immobile, within\nabout half a second,\noscillation goes\naway and is replaced\nby these large transient\naperiodic events,\nthese so-called\nsharp waves, because\nin the extracellular\nelectrical field\nthat you measure, you see\nthese large deflections.\nAnd then, if you zoom in--\nI'll also show you shortly--\nyou can actually see that\nthese very high frequency\noscillations, about 100 to 200\nhertz, riding on top of that,\nthese are referred\nto as, ripples.\nAnd this is the term that\nGyorgy Buzsaki came up with.\nHe described this sharp\nwave ripple activity\nas corresponding to this\noffline state, quiet wakeful,\nand some sleep states."], "1650": [12, 100, "So an animal's actually moving.\nAnd I've already shown you the\nspatial correlate, these place\ncells.\nBut there's another\nproperty of these cells\nthat O'Keefe also discovered.\nBut this was in early\n1990s, around 1991.\nAnd that is, he\nnoted, if you actually\nlook at the discharge of\nsingle spikes with respect\nto this oscillation,\nfirst of all,\nthe spikes are\nactually phase locked.\nIn other words, here\nspikes fire when\nthe oscillation, this theta\nrhythm, is at its peak.\nSo the idea is, this\noscillation really\nreflects time\nvarying excitability,\nsometimes where\ncells likely to fire,\nother times when it's not.\nAnd you can think of this\noscillation in excitability\nas being an oscillation\nin relative excitability,\nor inhibitions.\nSo inhibition, elevation\nis high, it's low,\nits high, it's low.\nWhen inhibition is\nlow, cell fires.\nWhen it's high,\ncell doesn't fire.\nSo this is modulation\nexcitability.\nYou see this here.\nBut he noted another\nthing, and that\nis, if you look at\nthe precise phase--\nso here, yes, cells tend\nto fire at the peak,\nbut here, this is now\nover time, but animal\nmoving at constant\nvelocity, space, and time,\nare interchangeable.\nSo as the animal's moving\nthrough it's place field,\nthe spikes start to fire earlier\nand earlier, as this phase\ncode, spatial location.\nSo you can tell, based\nupon the relative phase,\nwhether the animal is just\nentering the field, spikes fire\nlate, here close to the\npeak, versus further\ninto the field, where they\nfire a little bit earlier."], "1750": [13, 150, "into the field and\nrelative phase.\nWhat he termed,\nphase precession.\nAnd this is a\nrepresentation of that.\nThis is actual data.\nThis is just a cartoon\nthat illustrates\nthe basic principle.\nAnd so the idea that,\nif I have a place cell,\nif I look at the\nmarginal distribution\nas a function of location,\nthis would be the place field.\nOtherwise, it would just\ncollapse all of this.\nThis is the spiking now, as a\nfunction of position and phase.\nIf I just look at spiking\nas a function of position,\nas just the density of\nfiring, what I would get\nis a place field.\nNot many spikes here as the\nanimal enters the field, lots\nof spikes here as\nyou get into-- this\nwould be the classic\nspatial receptive field.\nBut now, if I introduce\nphase, as well, now you say,\n\"Oh, wait, there's a\nsystematic relationship as well\nbetween phase and location.\"\nIn fact, phase is a better\npredictor of relative location\nthan firing rate.\nIf I asked, when\ndid the spike occur?\nIf it occurred\nhere, late in phase,\nthen I know the animal is\njust entering the field.\nIf it occurs early\nin phase, I know\nit's at the end of its field.\nAnd that's interesting.\nAnd this is a simple\nmodel that says, well,\nan easy way of explaining\nthat is, if you just\nhave this excitability model--\nand this was one\nof the questions\nthat I guess you asked about\nthis sweeping inhibition.\nSo if we just imagine\nthat you have an input,\nexcitatory input, shown in blue,\nand then an inhibitory input,\nshown in red, where the\ninhibition is oscillating,\nand you apply a very\nsimple biophysical model\nthat says, a spike\naction potential is\ngoing to occur when\nexcitation and blue exceeds\ninhibition and red.\nMore excitation inhibition,\nyou get a spike.\nSo here, in this oscillation,\nanywhere the red trace\nis higher than the\nblue trace, no spiking.\nSo in this case, when\nexcitation is low,\nyou have to wait until\ninhibition drops all the way\nto here to get a spike.\nThis is late-phase.\nSo weak excitation\nmeans you have\nto wait until inhibition is low.\nSo this is the\nsweeping inhibition,\nyou have to wait until it's low.\nWhen excitation is strong, I\ndon't have to wait so long.\nIt can fire earlier.\nSo the principle here is\nthat there is a relationship\nbetween magnitude and latency.\nStronger means earlier.\nThat's the\nbiophysical principle.\nVery simple.\nStronger earlier, weaker later.\nThat will give you this\nphase precession property."], "1900": [14, 70, "of as this\nbiophysical curiosity.\nBut when you think\nabout how that\nwould apply when you have more\nthan one place cell-- in fact,\nI have two place cells here,\none in blue, one here in purple,\nwhere place cell one is to\nthe left of place cell two.\nSo as the animal's\ngoing through here,\nfirst the blue cell will fire,\nand then, the purple cell\nwill fire.\nAnd if you look\nat the excitatory\ndrive, shown here as a ramp\nin blue, ramp in purple,\nand now you ask,\n\"When is the blue cell\ngoing to fire, and the\npurple going to fire,\nduring each one of these\noscillatory cycles?\"\nThe answer will be, well,\nbecause the blue's-- the\nexcitatory drives the blue cells\nhigher than the purple cell,\nblue is always going\nto fire before purple.\nIn fact, in each\nand every cycle,\nit will be blue purple\nblue purple blue purple.\nSo this principle\nof phase precession,\nor phase coding,\nfor single cells,\nactually gives you sequential\nencoding across a population\nthat you will actually\non each and every cycle\nhave a sequence.\nThe code in the hippocampus\nis not a location,\nit's actually a\nsequence, a trajectory."], "1970": [15, 10, "to quickly go-- this is\njust talking about what\nthe spiking looks like.\nAnd you can see,\nif you look at it,\nyou see these spike sequences."], "1980": [16, 160, "when I do this decoding.\nSo what I'm showing you here--\nthis is, again, raw data.\nBut now, instead of\nshowing the spiking,\nI'm showing you that\nthe result of doing\nthis decoding, this Bayesian\ndecoding, where there's\na probability estimate\nthat given spiking activity\nin each one of a\nset of successive 20\nmillisecond windows--\nso I'm walking\nalong, now I'm firing\nat a finer temporal resolution\nevery 20 milliseconds.\nI'm doing the same\ndecoding, probability\nis indicated in grayscale.\nSo you can see here\nthe dark areas,\nthis is high probability\nthat this pattern--\nthe animal would have\nbeen in this location,\nor to get this\npattern of activity\nin this 20 millisecond bin.\nAnd so, what you can see\nhere is that the probability,\nthese Bayesian\ndecoded probabilities,\nform short sequences\nevery single theta cycle,\nwhat we refer to\nas theta sequences.\nAnd the theta sequences\nactually move from just\nbehind the animal--\ndotted line is where\nthe animal actually is.\nThe estimate goes from just\nbehind the animal to just\nin front of the animal.\nSo 10 times a second\nthe hippocampus\nis actually expressing\na representation\nof spatial sequence\nthat goes from behind\nto in front of the animal.\nYou can think of\nbehind and in front\nas also reflecting recent\npast and near future.\nSo there is this relative\npredictive differentiation\nof response as a function\nof oscillatory phase.\nSo if I want to look at, \"Gee,\nwhere did I just come from?\"\nI just have to look\nat activity here,\nat this slightly earlier phase.\nIf I want to ask the question,\n\"Gee, where am I likely to go\nto?\"\nI simply have to shift the\nphase, the channel that I\nlook at here, and\nI can see where\nthe likely future location is.\nSo you can think that\nthere is actually a code,\nnot just of location, but of\nthe relative causal relationship\nbetween locations\nmapped into phase.\nAnd we'll see that\nwe can experimentally\ntest this idea,\nthat that's just not\nan artifact of our decoding,\nbut the animals are actually\nusing information of\nthese different phases\nto drive spatial navigation\nin particular ways\nby using some of the tools\nfor manipulating activity\nin a closed loop optogenetics.\nSo we see we can manipulate\nactivity, specifically\nmanipulate activity, hippocampal\nactivity, different phases\nand show these different\nphases actually\ncarry different\nfunctional consequences.\nSo we've got these sequences.\nSo we've got these\nsequences captured\nduring these oscillations."], "2140": [17, 40, "Well, some of the\nindications that,\nA, the oscillations in the\nsequences are meaningful\nfirst come from the observation\nthat, as I mentioned,\nactually successful,\nusing memory--\ninformation that the hippocampus\nrequires that you actually\ncommunicate this to\nexecutive structures\nthat can guide behavior,\nmake

is that the same idea\nabout oscillatory phase\ngoverning the firing of cells\nin the hippocampus also applies\nin the prefrontal cortex.\nThat is, cells in\nthe prefrontal cortex\nlike to fire at a certain\nphase of the hippocampal theta\nrhythm.\nThey care about,\ntheir listening to,"], "2360": [23, 60, "And so, we can look at a task.\nThis is basically the\nsame kind of task,\nonly now there's a\nback-to-back T-maze.\nSo there can be two\nT-mazes, and we're just\ngoing to do a simple\nvariation on that,\non that working memory\ntask, in which the animal's\ngoing to start from\none of these

oscillations,"], "2430": [25, 70, "look at the firing with\nrespect to that, firing,\nspiking, as a function of this\noscillation in both structures.\nThe bottom line is\nwhat you find is,\nthat this is a measure\nof relative phase locking\nand as how well do\nprefrontal cells actually\nlock to this data oscillation.\nAnd what you find is that the\ndegree to which they locked\nthe theta rhythm is a function\nof whether or not the animal\nhas to choose.\nSo the red ones are when the\nanimal's going down the arm\nand it's got to choose.\nThe gray one is when it doesn't\nhave to choose, when we choose.\nThen in addition,\nthe solid red is\nwhen the animal had to\nchoose and it got it right.\nAnd the stipple red is\nwhen it had to choose\nand it got it wrong.\nSo the degree to which the\nprefrontal cortex actually\nlocks, successfully locks, to\nthe hippocampal theta rhythm,\npredicts whether the\nanimal actually makes\nthe correct choice or not."], "2500": [26, 210, "is necessary for effectively\ncommunicating information\nbetween the two structures.\nAnd, that not only is it in\nthe blocking of the spikes,\nspikes in the prefrontal cortex,\nthe rhythm in the hippocampus,\nit also comes in the blocking\nof the rhythms themselves.\nSo you can think\nof there being--\nthis is the theta\nrhythm that you\ncan detect in the prefrontal\ncortex and in the hippocampus.\nAnd what you can see is\nthere are two conditions.\nOne, the animal's actually\nchoosing, is running down here,\nit's making a choice.\nAnd in about the half second\nbefore the animal makes\na choice, you see these\ntwo rhythms actually\nlock, they become coherent.\nSo transient coherence\nis predictive\nof correct choice behavior.\nThe thinking is that\nthe rhythms themselves\ncan be generating coordinated\nthrough the regulation\nof these local\ninhibitory circuits.\nIn fact, there's been a lot\nof interest, for instance,\nin the relationship\nof local inhibitory\ncontrol and neuropsychiatric\ndisease and disorders.\nSo, for instance, disrupting\nlocal inhibitory rhythms.\nIn particular,\nsome, for instance,\nthe theta rhythms\nin prefrontal cortex\ncan be associated with\ndisorders like schizophrenia,\nfor instance.\nSo the inability to\neffectively impose these modes\nand then synchronize these\nmodes can introduce disruptions\nin the ability to\ncommunicate or use memory.\nCognitive disruption\ncoming through disruption\nof these oscillations through\ndisruption of inhibition\nin these local circuits.\nNow how you actually coordinate\nthese two subjective states.\nWe've been looking at the role\nof mid-line thalamic nuclei.\nSo the thalamus as being\na set of structures\nthat have widespread\nconnectivity to all\nthese cortical areas, that\nmuch of their connectivity\nis inhibitory, and so they\nhave the ability to actually\ncoordinate, modulate and\ncoordinate, these oscillatory\nmodes.\nWe've even just recently\npublished on individual cells\nwe found in some of these\nmid-line thalamic nuclei\nthat, for instance, will branch.\nSingle cells will\nbranch and target cells\nin the hippocampus and\nthe prefrontal cortex.\nSo they would be\nideally positioned\nto introduce, to\nselect and impose,\nthis synchronization there.\nSo that's the way\nwe think about a lot\nof this dynamic connectivity\nbeing established,\npresumably through some\nsort of thalamic regulation.\nAnd then, you think\nabout the thalamus\nas being regulated by those\nso-called thalamic reticular\nnucleus that\nregulates the thalamus\nand it sets up these modes.\nAnd there's also\na lot of interest\nnow in the thalamic\nreticular nucleus\nin disease and disorders.\nA lot of the genetic\nscreening has\nidentified targets in the\nthalamic reticular nucleus.\nSo you can think about it again.\nIt's like the oscillator in\nyour computer or your radio that\nbreaks down, you can't--\nthe information can be there,\nbut you can't tune into it.\nSo it's this fundamental tuning.\nYou've got to have\nthe modes and you've\ngot to be able to lock\nto these frequencies."], "2710": [27, 60, "it's not just the\nfrequencies, but it's also\nthe precise phase within\nthose oscillatory modes that\ncarry different information.\nThat we actually determine\nby taking advantage\nof these techniques,\noptogenetic techniques,\nfor targeted manipulation.\nSo you infect the\ninhibitory neurons\nin the hippocampus with\nthis optogenetically\nencoded and controllable\nchannel so that we can optically\nexcite inhibitory cells.\nSo we infect this excitatory\nchannel into inhibitory cells,\nand then, we can transiently,\ngiving very brief pulses\nof laser light, we can activate\ndrive, inhibitory cells,\nand then, because\nthe local circuit,\nthose inhibitory cells will\ninhibit the excitatory cells.\nAnd so we have about\n20-25 millisecond control."], "2770": [28, 330, "inhibition based upon the\nphase of this oscillation.\nSo the idea is, we're\ngoing to selectively\ndisrupt, or inactivate,\nthe hippocampus\nat different phases.\nWe're going to ask,\n\"Do those phases,\ndo they differ in terms\nof their contribution\nto behavior and performance?\"\nSo here, we're going\nto lock inhibition\nto either the peak of the trough\nof this state of oscillation.\nAnd so in this task--\nand we're going to do this\nmanipulation, that is,\nselectively inhibit--\nyou're picking\nhippocampal output\nat either the peak of the\ntrough, the theta rhythm,\nat two behavioral phases.\nSo in this task, animal's going\nto start on one of these arms,\ngoing to run up, and\nit's going to choose.\nSo we're going to think\nabout the starting arms as--\nwe'll refer to this\nas the encoding phase.\nThis is where you have to\nkeep track of where you are.\nAnd then, here in\nthe central arm--\nwe'll refer to this as\nthe retrieval phase.\nThis is where you\nhave to remember,\n\"Oh, where did I come from?\"\nAnd then use that to decide\nwhere you're going to go to.\nAnd what we found was\npretty surprising.\nAnd that is that, you\nmight think, well,\nif you shut off hippocampal\noutput, turn off\nthe hippocampus, you're\ngoing to get an impairment.\nIt's just like in\nthe examples that I\ngave of suggesting\nhippocampal's prefrontal cortex.\nMost of those come\nfrom lesion studies.\nYou damage the\nhippocampus, the animal\ncan't find its way around.\nSo if you were to optogentically\nlesion, or turn off\nthe hippocampus,\nyou might imagine,\nOK, animals won't be able\nto find a way around.\nSo you could ask,\n\"This experiment\nis going to identify which\nphase, which behavioral phase,\nare most effective in\ndisrupting performance?\"\nBut what we actually found\nwas, when you selectively\ninhibit activity at\ndifferent phases,\nyou actually get an\nenhancement of performance.\nThey get better.\nAnd it depended--\nthere wasn't just\none phase, a good\nphase and a bad phase,\nbut both at the\npeak and the trough\nwere both effective in\nenhancing performance,\nbut only when applied at\ncertain behavioral phases.\nIn fact, there was this\ndouble dissociation.\nAnd that is, that\ntrough stimulation,\nwhen applied here--\nso when you stimulate\nin the trough,\nin the retrieval segment,\nanimals got better.\nWhen you stimulate at the\npeak, in the encoding segment,\nanimals got better.\nSo it wasn't that the peak is\ngood or the trough as good,\nit's the peak.\nThe peak is good\nduring retrieval\nand the trough is\ngood during encoding.\nSo what it says is,\nthe peak and the trough\nhad two different functions.\nAnd if you actually think about\nwhat I was showing before,\nthese sequences,\nthese sequences that\nare going from just behind to\njust in front of the animal.\nWhat it says is, oh yeah,\nthese different phases, peak\nand trough, you can think\nof as like past and future.\nAnd so if I'm sitting over here\nin this encoding segment, what\nI'm really trying\nto do is I'm just\ntrying to keep track of\nwhere am I right now.\nNow, I may simultaneously\nalso be thinking about, oh,\nwhere am I going to go?\nBut for this task, it's\nnot really helpful.\nIt's not really useful.\nAt this point, I need to\nfocus on where I am right now.\nSo you can think\nof simultaneously,\nthe actions of\nthese two channels,\nwhere am I, where\nam I going to go.\nAnd I can enhance performance\nby shutting off or inhibiting\nthe non-relevant one.\nSo when I shut off the retrieval\nchannel here in the encoding,\nI get better.\nIt's like focusing attention.\nIt's like, pay attention\nto what you're doing now.\nStop thinking about stuff.\nSimilarly, when I'm here\nin the retrieval segment,\nI'm also encoding.\nI'm trying to keep track of\nwhere I am as well as, think\nabout where I'm going to.\nThe thing is, keeping\ntrack of where I am here,\nit's not relevant for the task.\nIt might be broadly\nrelevant for the animal,\nbut it's not relevant\nfor the task.\nSo when I shut off, I turn\noff that encoding channel,\nI'm able to enhance the\nretrieval information that\ngoes out.\nYou might interpret\nthis saying, \"Oh,\nso this is how we can improve\nmemory by selectively shutting\noff the hippocampus.\"\nWell, this is not a strategy for\ngeneral cognitive enhancement.\nHippocampus is working much\nbetter when all these phases\nare in operation.\nAnd that's because\nthe hippocampus is not\ndesigned to solve this task.\nHippocampus is designed\nto solve the broader task.\nIt's trying to figure out how\nis this task relevant to all\nthe other things\nthat I have to do?\nIn other words, you're trying\nto integrate this information\ninto all the other\ninformation you have.\nAnd that requires connecting\nthe encoding or retrieval.\nYou really need to have all\nof those pieces of information\navailable.\nBut it does point out\nthat one can actually\ndissociate the\nfunction of information\nof these two different phases.\nThe phase actually matters.\nAnd it matters at the\nlevel of high level\nbehavior, decision-making.\nIt's not just a idiosyncrasy\nor artifact of--\nexcitability is a\nfunction of phase.\nThis is really how\ninformation is being used.\nSources of content the\nrespective copyright\nholders, all rights reserved,\nexcluded from our Creative\nCommons license.\nFor more information,
