accelerate those numbers you're not like typical arms control affect almost the day they are\nso it's always too slow for arms control people you know it's always welcome but always too slow\nbut you know your take what you can get but again I want to just repeat one thing the new start reading\nthe big thing about the big success of the new start reading in my view which was not stress by the newspapers for the comment\nis the fact that the inspections are going on and the inspections in my view on much more critical than the number\nthat's such overkill whether it's 1000 or 1500 weapons I mean again this 100 number is overkill so Khmer\nit's almost a relevant except symbolically whether you have 1000 or 1500 the lowest thousand you get into\nwith how many does China have and how many Union are in South what they showed you so so thousands roughly that the critical point in which\nwar of the nuclear Powers nuclear weapons States I should say have two you know negotiate with each other not just the year\nof course Rogers critical they're ok I'm going to stop and of course there's been a lot of questions but I'm happy for more of this\nwhatever yeah\nanother way of\nwell first of all we already have it and it's conventional smart Warfare\nhaven't talked about it United States cause it's Global Strike which were developing and that's a whole other dimension it's not a nuclear arms\nbut it was too much for me to get into that but yes you're asking a very good question and or conventional military\nhours are incredible and we can do now in many respects with conventional weapons what we could have done only\nnuclear weapons 20 years ago even 10 years ago and this Global Strike which is a way to\nright across the world with Precision with conventional weapons with missiles with a Cruise missiles\nand so forth is incredible and it's all sophisticated command-and-control stuff what's guidance yeah\nwell replace it in the sense that you don't have nuclear weapons\nother people are just as scared as before so it's it's it's it's awesome an aggressive military posture and\nin the day and age when we're really trying to replace that then we can no longer distinguish between\nconventional arms control in nuclear arms control they will become merged I think as a subject as an intellectual subject as well as a practice\nbut I'm looking at head probably at least 10 years but in my view that they will come so you really asking a great question\nyes disturbing the peace action will have plenty of work for plenty of\nI'm afraid OK but can I say that I'm not happy about that but it's a fact\ndo you know who in India Pakistan process that natural body no\nis it ok in India lock Here's what I know I don't know more than\nyou know what I think is true in India is that the Armed Forces are under civilian control\nbut but are in Pakistan that is not true so Pakistan is not what you would\na unitary state ok there is no single command the third I mean there is officially but de facto\nwe know that the Pakistani military is at least equal to the civilian branch but this\nplay whatever it is the security thing it seems to be quasi-independent I'm not sure\ncan see I mean my but one I'm afraid of us with this address I said it before but I just repeat it is this aggressive first\nstrike military nucleus posture of Pakistan is leading\ndelegation of authority to lower levels where there's a great danger of a road Commander so I see Pakistan\nplace with the most danger of a rogue Commander ok and I think I'm not the only one who thinks this\nby the way roughly to 150\n200 it's more than 100 now ok they're making more all the time they make\nfast as they can as far as we can tell OK no India seems to be more relaxed\nloud it both in terms of their aggressive-passive they say they won't fire first in the has a much more reasonable stated policy of use\nthey they're much more laid-back they they say they won't use them first they\nsay the Pakistan is a just going much much too far but on the Indian side the problem that I\nis there not trying for the political solution another words they're past their deployment posture is more sensible\nbut they're focused on China Sea so but they are not India my big criticism of India is\nI'm not solving the problem ok man I come back to that right\nthe Bing much too slow in in trying to heal problems like Cashmere and other\npoints in the relationship ok I mean they're not gonna disappear overnight but they could they could do things\nok and I can point the some literature but I'm I'm not a real expert by the way they're not being the United States of not being even-handed\nanatom mistake that's a basic American mistake so you know\ncritical since the beginning I'm not the only one you know on this basis but I think the predictable is happening\njust wondering Pakistan into a more frenzied state of the value of nuclear weapons development ok it's on for\nbut we're doing something we don't want to see happen ok we deployment one 1 hour and and\nencourage it in directly on the other so it's a contradictory policy unfortunate\nthey should no better but they have their the learning commercial interest override\nyou know that this tug of war write that Tasmania\nso\nunderbrush somehow right it's\nwell we also make military hardware sales turn to India which is increasing that was all\nit was one of the other things from the Obama visit the sale of conventional military equipment 2nd is going up\nok for the first time in a long time so that was a big success I guess yes\nyes I forgot to mention that ok you reminded me\ncall Cathy ok thank you thank you for coming"]}
