3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I've prepared some slides of course but I don't know please interrupt it anytime and ask questions ok

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I've sort of got a big Panorama things to talk about it's basically impossible to cover everything ok

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:50,000
basically I advertised this talk as an outlook for the future and of course that that

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:00,000
to bride so I picked a few things which are of special interest to me and what they are are the pathway the possible

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:10,000
pathways to nuclear war ok now as you know that what I what I

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:20,000
talk about orphan is in comparison and comparing the danger to the planet

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:30,000
of course it's population of climate change and nuclear war ok so climb

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,000
change is just I think the probability is pretty close to 100% it's I don't know how to Qantas

11
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:50,000
but it's it's fairly certain that we are we are into an era of

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:00,000
warming hand and it's consequences and this is a slow steady thing terms of probability of occurrence with all its

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:10,000
occasions nuclear war is much easier to avoid but if it happens and I've got

14
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:20,000
read a the probability is very low that's what I call the probability structure so the probability of a nuclear war any specific day

15
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:30,000
is lol the cumulative probability is higher of course and if that event occurs it's

16
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:40,000
just traffic so what happens is the destruction just starts in that the cat is the destruction of course is local in the place

17
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:50,000
weapon blows up the the destruction of depends how many bombs go off and how much so it goes

18
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:00,000
but we could have a Global consequences if there are enough of them so called nuclear winter

19
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:10,000
ok so having said that I just want to talk about that this is the theatre

20
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:20,000
awesome that that's what keeps some of us worrying about this problem and working on it ok so basically I want

21
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:30,000
talk about the possible pathways to nuclear war I'll talk a little bit about proliferation and the non-proliferation treaty say just a few

22
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:40,000
it's about the possibility of nuclear weapons abolition we bit about Obama's record and and

23
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:50,000
ok that's that's a pretty ambitious agenda

24
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:00,000
there are endless debates about the utility of nuclear weapons some people are

25
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:10,000
roll having them not using them but having them because of course they were Pro

26
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:20,000
and the one case that they were use and of course we use them on Hiroshima and Nagasaki

27
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:30,000
people says that actually save lives because the war ended more quicker that way I think that's why we need to be

28
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:40,000
goldbug it's a point of view which is held OK so it it actually save casualties

29
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:50,000
and a prevented World War 3 these are some of the arguments I'm not trying to give all of them but these arguments that you can find in the

30
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and you can find books and this goes back and forth ok and of course the

31
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:10,000
the counter argument was that that the use of atomic weapons in in Japan was was not necessary

32
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:20,000
what was really necessary was to agree that the emperor could stay on and that turned out to be the key

33
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:30,000
ok that people argue and certainly almost everyone agrees that the use of the second born in Nagasaki

34
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:40,000
was something that should not have been done ok I think there's much more agreement to that

35
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:50,000
a box that this use was actually the first step of the Cold War ok of course

36
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Japanese civilians were killed 700000 and 2 cities with destroyed on the other hand we destroyed almost all

37
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:10,000
major cities in Japan by conventional weapons and and of course Japan did not have an unblemished record in Korean Chinese

38
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm not going to go into that but the moral dimensions of World War 2 a pretty horrible OK let's start

39
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:30,000
ok are the Inner Vision about killing civilians are pretty much disappeared in World War 1 and was just told

40
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:40,000
ignored in World War 2 I would say ok and in the post

41
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:50,000
error the argument is that you didn't need nuclear weapons to prevent a war between the United States and the Soviet Union

42
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:00,000
ok I pretty much think that's the case myself so the question here is

43
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:10,000
questions are there they have no nuclear Wars are since the first two weapons were used of

44
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:20,000
how many explosions but they were test ok so was that the torrents there's a theory about nuclear taboo because

45
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:30,000
morally so awful I'm a bit sceptical but it's a theory that out there by an important yelsos

46
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:40,000
our just is it luck of the reasons and so forth so many

47
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:50,000
well I'll give you some of my conclusion that the end but the crucial question is does the possession of nuclear weapons make a country more secure

48
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:00,000
you heard this in the case of Ukraine when when the Russians are took the Crimea when they basically have their stealth

49
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:10,000
vision of the Ukraine how OK which is going on as we speak wood

50
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:20,000
are Ukrainian nuclear weapon the term of them and when the Soviet Union broke up in the

51
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:30,000
1991 there was a lot of discussion about what would happen to all the nuclear weapons they were mostly in Russia

52
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:40,000
rain and kazakistan and we managed to persuade the ukranians they were the toughest and

53
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:50,000
marquees to give all those weapons to Russia but in fact or one of the things

54
00:08:50,000 --> 00:09:00,000
there's a lot of History here but one of the best articles that I've read and I think it's obviously true I stayed

55
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:10,000
that that in fact the Ukraine And Kazakhstan never really own those weapons ok they were really owned by the

56
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Union the Ukrainian army was not prepared to take them in any way they really didn't have an army they have

57
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:30,000
have an army now 20 years later or something ok so there's no realistic way

58
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:40,000
the ukranians had a nuclear weapon that could be used they had possession of nuclear weapons but not the actual ability to use

59
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:50,000
ok so it's a very funny thing it's a very special case and it's a very funny thank but

60
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:00,000
how do I recommend this Herd I would say more important or at least as important as is the presents

61
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Malaysian stable this is a key question ok many people doubt it that are good fortune and

62
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:20,000
having any nuclear exchanges since 1945 is purely the torrents if there isn't an element of lock

63
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:30,000
the issues involved and each specific case is different so it's hard to generalise

64
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I mean one of the issues what are the differences between physics arms control is how the LAC

65
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:50,000
controllers is the lack really of science how much you know more difficult the situation is to evaluate

66
00:10:50,000 --> 00:11:00,000
ok and of course now or with with relationships between the United

67
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:10,000
states in Russia in fact the whole West and Russia at a low Point probably a few decade-old low Point

68
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:20,000
future of arms control seems bleak at this moment I have to say it's hard to maintain optimism

69
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:30,000
ok I'm finally versus perennial question about abolishing nuclear weapons which is certainly more and more remote as time goes on but I think

70
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:40,000
as academics we should think about it because there's a very important issues OK so we should think long range is

71
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:50,000
saying it's not going to happen quickly obviously if it all but is it desirable there are two separate questions

72
00:11:50,000 --> 00:12:00,000
desirable and is it going to happen ok so immediately after

73
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:10,000
the development of the atomic bomb there were intense discussions inside of the Manhattan Project before the public knew about it

74
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:20,000
ok and there was this famous Frank report and the conclusions of the Frank report

75
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:30,000
use the bomb for a demonstration not on cities share the secret the secret not nursery the details

76
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:40,000
make it I don't think anyone ever propose that what what's meant here is Cher the secret of it's existence before it's use

77
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:50,000
that's what they're talking about because the use without notice particularly without notice to the Soviet

78
00:12:50,000 --> 00:13:00,000
would ensure the start of a Call of a war a cold war and a nuclear arms race and that's exactly what

79
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:10,000
scientists predicted very sophisticated people Frank was a Nobel Laureate from Germany to escape from Hitler

80
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:20,000
ok and the there were many other things that happened the scientist

81
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:30,000
send it together they formed the the bulletin of the atomic scientists the Federation of atomic scientists which still goes on although it's not a straw

82
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:40,000
is it was and they develop this actions for Lillian plan William floor plan

83
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:50,000
which oppenheim I played a major role and then ended up as the brook plan which was not really what was proposed and

84
00:13:50,000 --> 00:14:00,000
it was turn down immediately by the Soviet Union ok for various reasons I can go into them but I won't

85
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:10,000
so the error of possible arms control in in 45 19459

86
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:20,000
46 collapsed ok and in the beginning of the Cold War period and

87
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:30,000
what the scientists fear the most happened and the other thing is and you hear this from the people who

88
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:40,000
first developed the bomb and then work is actively as they could against it and many of them were at MIT some of the name

89
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:50,000
you know very well Victor vice cough there was Hans Bader from Cornell and there was just a whole group people very proud

90
00:14:50,000 --> 00:15:00,000
scientists and Hans Bader both Vicky vice cough and hands played told me purse

91
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:10,000
they said it many times and public then when we realise then about 19:46 that there was no agreement was going to happen

92
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:20,000
house elf what is the worst thing that could happen and they said we would build 100 weapons

93
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:30,000
100 and the Russians would build 100 weapons and then we would face each other down with 100 weapons that was the

94
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:40,000
take the sophisticated right man for imagine in 1946

95
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:50,000
what did people expect first the atomic scientists they thought that the nuclear weapon was so high

96
00:15:50,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Bollywood change the behaviour of mankind and politicians like Churchill and Roosevelt believed

97
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:10,000
that this powerful weapon would allow England and the United States with the Monopoly to 2B

98
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:20,000
be able to say the way the world evolved ok so both sides were wrong

99
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:30,000
typical ok so are the influence that it had has been reasonably smart we never

100
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:40,000
stop the Russians to agreed almost anything we wanted them to do for example that took over Eastern Europe we hated that

101
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:50,000
let you know it just goes on and on the Communist China we hated that you know we're just

102
00:16:50,000 --> 00:17:00,000
the things you know I just mention a few major ones ok so that's what I mean by it's course of influence its possession became as

103
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:10,000
a symbol almost straight away and but there is some the torrents in it it isn't the torrents

104
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:20,000
sleep well useless the torrents and a pirate's a combination of the two of my think works the some extent so there's been a nine news

105
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:30,000
now I want you to look at this graph this is the buildup of nuclear weapons between us and

106
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Soviet Union and you'll notice this scale 5000-10000

107
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:50,000
100 is down here ok the Soviet Union blew up their first bomb for

108
00:17:50,000 --> 00:18:00,000
is after we dead ok as predicted not only was it predicted that they would get the bomb but that they were

109
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:10,000
take them 3 to 5 years that was the number that was given by the atomic scientists and it was hotly disputed and watching than that so

110
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:20,000
and again we built up to astronomical numbers tens of thousands of weapons and finally we have a

111
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:30,000
the climb through nuclear arms control agreements and through terrifying events like the Cuban missile crisis

112
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:40,000
and other spirit of that build up is I think exemplified in this great cartoon ok

113
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:50,000
you can read for yourself from the middle of the Cold War ok and I think this says the story

114
00:18:50,000 --> 00:19:00,000
here here well I mean they developed all kinds of fancy strategies but at the heart of it was fear

115
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:10,000
just plain fear of a devastating First Strike and then you had the build up counterforce capabilities

116
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:20,000
absorb the First Strike and the able to destroy the enemy after the First Strike of but the astronomical number

117
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:30,000
was mad and it was called mad mutually assured destruction it was literally

118
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:40,000
mad I was looking from the outside but we won't really on the outside because we would have been the victims so it was

119
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:50,000
but you're not logic logic is is in a certain sense of relevant in this situation I am in this such

120
00:19:50,000 --> 00:20:00,000
a grip of fear on both sides and it's really true I sat through the Cuban missile crisis person

121
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:10,000
with a dedicated Russian Communist so it actually come to work in my laboratory was a very interesting experience

122
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:20,000
before was all the fault of the United States most of the people thought it was the 4th of the

123
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Soviet Union lots of people here but I thought they were both it for you no

124
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:40,000
natewa equally nice people but that you know they were just upgrading from too much fear so they overdid it

125
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:50,000
do you know this business of 100 when they often our students and class how many weapons are enough and nobody

126
00:20:50,000 --> 00:21:00,000
how to answer that question but then I say well how many cities are you willing to give up you know the case of the rushes masca leningrad that's Two Cities

127
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:10,000
and there's a famous exchange between Jerome reasoner who is ex president of mit and also science

128
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:20,000
the Canada with gorbaczow or he asked him exactly this question and and Gorbachev was just amazed

129
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:30,000
so well that there you go so I think it's fear and distrust

130
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:40,000
cause fear in this plus they go together that's very important I just want to point out that one of my nuclear submarines

131
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:50,000
this is the maximum loading by the weather load it a little less now but it doesn't matter I don't I don't change the slide but

132
00:21:50,000 --> 00:22:00,000
quickly they have 100 and 300kw Warheads so an order of magnitude larger than the Hiroshima weapon or not

133
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:10,000
lucky weapon and each submarine has a maximum loading it should say of 96 Warheads

134
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:20,000
independently targeted you can destroy 96 targets after firing it takes 10 or 15 minutes to reach

135
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:30,000
OK so you could it's kind of staggering ok so the total explosive power is 3

136
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:40,000
times that of World War 2 1 submarine it's incredible ok

137
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:50,000
this is the present Global inventory more or less you can see this is the number that counts

138
00:22:50,000 --> 00:23:00,000
these is the strategic why is ok and you can see there the order of 1500 which is this new Star Trek

139
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:10,000
we're just about it that limit anyway and that all the other countries have typically a few hundred at the most are these are all this is

140
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:20,000
gas work as to the numbers nobody it's well it's not known know I think 10 for North Korea's probably

141
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:30,000
factor of 2 over 3 high but gives order of magnitude this is gas work frankly cause these are all secret

142
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:40,000
people do the best they can let this is a table from Hans Christian Cinema Federation of American scientists who keeps track of these thing

143
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:50,000
well as he can all they look at the literature and they look at budgets and they look at satellite pic

144
00:23:50,000 --> 00:24:00,000
they do their best I think they have the right order of magnitude but nobody claims they know the exact number I mean if you talk to her

145
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:10,000
question says very good and who knows what he's doing he's very smart and competent he'll tell you

146
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:20,000
educated guesswork ok but it's more or less it's enough you you know I mean 90 100 weapons

147
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:30,000
it's all 100 weapons is overkill

148
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:40,000
they want it to be highest

149
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:50,000
except for Israel which doesn't want to admit as any but they want it known anyway so it's a complex game but for most

150
00:24:50,000 --> 00:25:00,000
other countries they say it's for the torrents so it's better to let your adversary know what you've got

151
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:10,000
a chain is also very quiet about the numbers because they have relatively few numbers and they want to keep this positions

152
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:20,000
greater than all of that so they don't want to have and they don't keep the missiles on alert either Chinese a very

153
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:30,000
country with respect and nuclear weapons ok and pops exception

154
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:40,000
so the pathways the nuclear escalation and war as as I stressed is

155
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:50,000
is fear fear to me is the biggest Factor ok I'm sure people will argue with me or every point I'm making it some

156
00:25:50,000 --> 00:26:00,000
what was controversial by the way I don't you know I'm not trying to hide it but just I can't give you every nuance

157
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:10,000
that's 1 hr people write books about each subject so you know you have to oversimplified

158
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:20,000
anyway I consider the two possible pathways to war one is an accidental launch

159
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:30,000
between the United States and Russia and the other is escalation from conventional war and Indian Pakistan ok

160
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:40,000
now somewhat less likely is North Korea's use of a weapon but I suspect they won't because I think they

161
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:50,000
are constrained by other military reasons in on the Korean Peninsula

162
00:26:50,000 --> 00:27:00,000
North Korea wants to rattle the sword so to speak but they I think really want it for both the turns

163
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:10,000
as far as I can tell and for the survivability of the regime which is a whole other you know but that comes into all these think that's why you cases

164
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:20,000
North Korea is a very special case is a very odd government than and so forth so so

165
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:30,000
ok now we had the pin the rain talked about escalation from conventional war and he talked about the deployment one of the things

166
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:40,000
he talks about which I think it's very sound is that this whole issue when you talk about the torrents it isn't just numbers there's a whole

167
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:50,000
the mansion at least and one is the the deployment posture ok and Pakistan has a very aggressive

168
00:27:50,000 --> 00:28:00,000
posture because they feel inferior and conventional weapons to India and that they feel threatened by India

169
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:10,000
anyways ok and they've already been partitioned by India went when when the country broke up into the East

170
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:20,000
pipe Bangladesh and India so so there are there's a historic enmity between the tool which needs to be

171
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I don't want it needs to be fixed and I have to say personally that I was very disappointed with a bomb

172
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:40,000
visit to India in many respects and I woke you know I look at the nuclear issue and one of the length it's

173
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:50,000
my lenses and I looked it isn't my solondz but it it's it's an important Focus for me and what I see is over

174
00:28:50,000 --> 00:29:00,000
talks about the climate which is excellent then he's gets on this very poor policy of selling

175
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:10,000
nuclear nuclear energy nuclear reactors to India and

176
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:20,000
exempting India from the restrictions that used to be in place before bush before the bush administration

177
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I've exempting India from the restrictions we placed on them because they violated than that the non proliferation treating and

178
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:40,000
weapons of course Pakistan did so also but the point is that we just aggravate the Indian Pakistan

179
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:50,000
tension as far as I can tell and I just read the New York Times

180
00:29:50,000 --> 00:30:00,000
you know and listen to the BBC is far as I can tell the subject of

181
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:10,000
reading Pakistan of of diffusing the tension with Pakistan did not arise as far as I can tell this there was no pub

182
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:20,000
mention of it and I was very disappointed and they're trying to draw Obama's also trying to draw Hindi asthma

183
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:30,000
turn with China then with Pakistan this is this is a sort of three-way dance if you want to put it that way

184
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:40,000
and it's so it's more complicated than a bipolar interaction so three-way game where where China

185
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:50,000
is India India fragrance Pakistan in China ends up helping Pakistan with nuclear issues and

186
00:30:50,000 --> 00:31:00,000
weapons that should say originally gave Pakistan the design for the bomb so this is something that

187
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:10,000
India wants to solve this issue of Pakistan's aggressive deployment they either have to do it by force

188
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:20,000
work because India husband deterred or they have to do it through the plumber saying and it always end

189
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:30,000
what does massage ok you can use for switch won't work while you can use the plumber see which has a chance which is difficult but as a

190
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:40,000
those are the two ways to solve the problem OK so how could a war start by ACS

191
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:50,000
between us and Russia ok well basically it's the most likely

192
00:31:50,000 --> 00:32:00,000
is a malfunctioning of the early warning systems so

193
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:10,000
here's here's a chilling quote from vice president train when he was vice president

194
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:20,000
you read it for a minute ok

195
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:30,000
famous football he's talking about ok or black box

196
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:40,000
this is carried around wherever the president of the United States goes there's somebody a few doors down

197
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:50,000
24/7 who can say Mr President were under fire here's the button

198
00:32:50,000 --> 00:33:00,000
OK now we're actually isn't the physical button but that doesn't matter that's that's

199
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:10,000
irrelevant it's the equivalent of a physical button ok it's a virtual button

200
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:20,000
ok so I just chilling and you ask what about the constitution what about consulting what about anything know because of the

201
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:30,000
10 minute to 13 minute lunchtime and the 10 minute warning time ok so

202
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:40,000
we have roughly 1000 missiles and so does Russia on hair trigger alert that ready to be fired at minutes note

203
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:50,000
the numbers probably closer to 900 but so are ok as I say mentioned

204
00:33:50,000 --> 00:34:00,000
delivery times and decision times ok so the probability of an era is not negligible OK it is

205
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:10,000
is the complex physical emotional sister it's a human system

206
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Seer I keep emphasizing this because there is fear of at very basic fear

207
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:30,000
and it said what what Hawks don't realise is that on each side is vulnerable to the other system UK

208
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:40,000
not stop the attack all you can do is retaliate another words it's

209
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:50,000
term or Revenge those of the two modes of operation this is chilling but that is the world Within

210
00:34:50,000 --> 00:35:00,000
for 50 years literally people on think about it but it's pretty awful ok never

211
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:10,000
is that the Russian system is less robust so we are actually more vulnerable than they except that will fire if they do

212
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:20,000
sell and of course why does it go on its side does it cost the other does it

213
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:30,000
this is not logic this is not normal logic this is a tight circle

214
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:40,000
ok and so the latest that is surfaced in the last few years a cyber attack ok so

215
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:50,000
you ask how this can happen well a cyber attack just imagine somebody hacks into the system somebody who really want

216
00:35:50,000 --> 00:36:00,000
the United States and Russia to destroy each other into the early war

217
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:10,000
system of either side just imagine that that's a nightmare

218
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:20,000
the only as I mentioned is that the safety of each side depends on the other side not launching ok and then

219
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:30,000
does the political question why do we persist Obama promise to do something about it when he came to office but he is

220
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:40,000
shut up is clearly given it up without explanation but it was one of his

221
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:50,000
of course the more attention that

222
00:36:50,000 --> 00:37:00,000
the more scary this is it's last scary when there's no tension obviously it's it's feerick

223
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:10,000
and all the things that go with fear fear yeah I'm taking almost this Anonymous

224
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:20,000
distrust because the other side has the capability to destroy you and a second strike capability and

225
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:30,000
language of Cold War you know your house why it happens with all this strategic doktrin but a second strike capability and launch on

226
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I physically identical with a First Strike posture so you can

227
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I mean the other side tells you we love you but it's like having a guest over for dinner when the guests comes

228
00:37:50,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Holden not just up not just the pistol high-powered rap

229
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:10,000
and says all yes we're Pals I'm here for dinner what kind of

230
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:20,000
it's a little naughty but maybe who am I to judge ok so

231
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I want to talk a little bit about the non-proliferation treaty because I think it's one of the things that very important in

232
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:40,000
world is is that nuclear weapons don't spread you know the other countries at the cornerstone of that is the name proliferation 3D

233
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:50,000
and honestly I think in the nuclear power in the nuclear weapons States particularly United States

234
00:38:50,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Russia v npt is not taken as seriously as it should be ok and I think it's very important the

235
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:10,000
BTS take and seriously for hair of what it does namely it says that people

236
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:20,000
not require nuclear weapons but it is not taken seriously because it obligates the 5 nuclear powers

237
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:30,000
watch nuclear Powers to give up their nuclear weapons and this is really the heart of abolition of nuclear weapon

238
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:40,000
built-in it's article 6 of the 9 proliferation treaty it obligates us to do it and so there's a tremendous 10

239
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:50,000
come back to this and a minute but the tension is between the nuclear between the countries who gave up aspirations for nuclear

240
00:39:50,000 --> 00:40:00,000
saying to the nuclear weapons Powers ok you are obligated to do it but the nuclear

241
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:10,000
finns country say well we're doing it very gradually and responsibly and now I'll talk more about this

242
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:20,000
the nun nuclear weapons States want really a timetable OK so there's a lot of tension

243
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I'll come to this in a minute ok so the cornerstones as I mention article 6 non-proliferation this armour

244
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:40,000
and I I write disarmament and in Blackall oh they're all extremely important I do this for

245
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:50,000
audience ok but the last point is that there's a 5 year review every

246
00:40:50,000 --> 00:41:00,000
reviews there's a review the next one or been this may and they're going to be fireworks so I'll talk about that

247
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:10,000
OK so how effective is the npt ok so

248
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:20,000
four States outside the treaty is real India Pakistan North Korea there was this ECU

249
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:30,000
network from Pakistan which was shut down it's never been absolutely clear how much the Pakistan is state

250
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:40,000
involved or this was a private venture Scott Camp talk interestingly about how the

251
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:50,000
12 material that was sold by the AQ Khan network actually setback countries like a ran ok

252
00:41:50,000 --> 00:42:00,000
when they're nuclear in the development of sent a few because what was sold was a technology which

253
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:10,000
was absolute and inefficient ok so it's very ironic

254
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:20,000
so a few countries have given up their bombs or excuse me and many countries have given up nuclear

255
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:30,000
men's programs I've listed some of them there are many nuclear capable countries that don't have weapons Japan as one of them of course

256
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:40,000
not surprisingly Canada are friends and Canada but even South Korea that feels very

257
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:50,000
buy North Korea has no but they are quite capable ok and

258
00:42:50,000 --> 00:43:00,000
main point they want to make it that fewer countries have nuclear weapons that we're predicted in the early 60s like famous

259
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Kennedy JFK set allowed that in a few years

260
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:20,000
team the 25 countries would have nuclear weapons and he was reflecting what the US intelligence agencies told him ok he was

261
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:30,000
making this up it wasn't just a speech he was reflecting what he was told ok and right now the political Norm

262
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:40,000
pronounce nuclear weapons and press the ones that have it'd the Disarm ok and that is a big Plus

263
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:50,000
and one that needs encouragement there are problems with the npt of course

264
00:43:50,000 --> 00:44:00,000
life isn't perfect North Korea in my view is the most serious problem well Pakistan I haven't even written it down here but Bacchus

265
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:10,000
then India bigger problems because of the power possible pathways to war I already said that I didn't want to repeat it that's why it's not on the slow

266
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:20,000
what the whole issue with a ran there's no question that are rands in Richmond capabilities Excel

267
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:30,000
what I can do for power another words that very well suited for making weapons and not for power because they don't produce

268
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:40,000
offer power they don't produce enough enriched uranium for power needs but they do produce enough for weapons and that's been clear since the beginning

269
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:50,000
of the program despite what it said and so there's a

270
00:44:50,000 --> 00:45:00,000
set a tremendous tension there I just want to talk a little bit about the I'm going the go see Asians that making a lot of

271
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:10,000
news now ok it's very important because we have an interim agreement and this is the

272
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:20,000
I'm 6 months it's really 4 months on the political level and 6 months on the technical level to reach a final agreement that's what was

273
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I mean the first one was supposed to be 6 months in was extended well excuse me the first phase agreement was

274
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:40,000
6 months then it's been extended it's not on here but it's been extended for 6 more months so the deadline for the political agree

275
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:50,000
is is a in March and then in June I think it's the deadline the official deadline people ask

276
00:45:50,000 --> 00:46:00,000
call but I don't know ok there are some technical issues the Iraq reactor can produce both plutonium but

277
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:10,000
simple solutions to that there are simple technical fixes and they ran has agreed to them as I understand so so that the amount of food

278
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:20,000
production from the Iraq reactor will be small ok

279
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:30,000
interim agreement that they're not supposed to be any additional sanctions that's very important in terms of the US congress because bills have circulate

280
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:40,000
demanding new sanctions but they're probably and obedience fortunately VR

281
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:50,000
for the really for parties involved feed the two official parties and then

282
00:46:50,000 --> 00:47:00,000
add line is on both sides so this is a complex negotiation within each side it's complex ok I'm

283
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:10,000
count go into all of it and I think people know what's going on better on

284
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:20,000
on the American side but the real issue is far as I can see it in terms of a ran

285
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:30,000
ran wants is the have I think the ayatollah said something like 15000 centrifuge

286
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:40,000
the worst the Hard Light the most hide line people in the west said 0 ok

287
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:50,000
for example 0 is the only acceptable number of centrifuges so every and that's why he's campaigning so

288
00:47:50,000 --> 00:48:00,000
but against it because he knows that there will be no deal with 0 centrifuges we already knows and advanced that

289
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:10,000
see why it is not possible so well they knew

290
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:20,000
probably 20000 advanced ones advanced ones not what they have the so-called pee ones ok ones that work

291
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:30,000
ok I can give you a car but you know I don't know what the top of my head but the supply what is it but she

292
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:40,000
is that the right pronunciation the bus near reactor which they don't need by the way because rush is going to supply the fuel but they don't why trust

293
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:50,000
of course for reasonable reasons I think but but anyway this whole business is so murky

294
00:48:50,000 --> 00:49:00,000
my personal opinion ok it's hard to tell facts from motive in my opinion I don't think

295
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:10,000
can do it honestly all talk with you privately if you want but you know I don't think I can really evaluate it in a

296
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:20,000
that I would consider satisfactory I can tell you I can speculate that's what I can do but

297
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:30,000
the point is you know if there's a there's an old saying that that the ideal solution gets in the way of a good so

298
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:40,000
the good solution in my opinion is pretty much to continue the interim agreement that we have

299
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:50,000
why is that good because what people are not talking about in the United States is the best thing about

300
00:49:50,000 --> 00:50:00,000
call negotiation namely that are ran keep saying they don't want to develop nuclear weapon

301
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:10,000
and there's a fat war that's excellent second what

302
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:20,000
and says that they want to be part of the npt they are in during and I'm going to use that word and doing

303
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:30,000
rigorous inspection regime that the iaea that's the international agency that in specs

304
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:40,000
international atomic energy agency they are in doing the most rigorous inspections that any country ever indoor

305
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:50,000
that was a two excellent think there are people on the ground all the time people say well they can break out

306
00:50:50,000 --> 00:51:00,000
yes they can break out if they want to they will only they will only agree to all of this if it's in

307
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:10,000
self-interest nobody can expect anything more of them or us

308
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:20,000
so I think what we've got is the best possible solution that part that's feasible and if

309
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:30,000
they kick inspectors out in the side to go for a bond because they it was it close to impossible for them to do a

310
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:40,000
alarm with our picking The Inspectors out and well

311
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:50,000
what's faster then develop so many thousand more centrifuges and have that material and no news could leak out and all of that stuff their opposition

312
00:51:50,000 --> 00:52:00,000
we found out about some of the sites I forget which one the one that's on the ground I forgot the name of it through through the centres in a

313
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:10,000
it always can happen the Soviet Union found out about the Manhattan Project in and most

314
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:20,000
what are talk about that for a minute because that's really important in 1940 a Soviet nuclear physicist

315
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:30,000
good morning flower of realise that all the publications about fishing in the United States England and France at start

316
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:40,000
and he went to Stalin and said the west is developing an atomic bomb based on what was

317
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:50,000
not appearing in the literature this is remarkable and it's a fact of course the Soviet Union

318
00:52:50,000 --> 00:53:00,000
spies and they found out about the Manhattan Project through the spies but flare of just reading the physical review

319
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:10,000
OK this is a remarkable story which should not be ignored ok

320
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I think we find out maybe slowly but you know and and if they really

321
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:30,000
the weapon is at the torrent they've got it show us that they have it like North Korea's there are all kinds of steps and 1

322
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:40,000
open isn't good enough I mean I wrote in our bed with Jim Walsh that that this whole Breakout time thing is too short you know the calculator

323
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I said as soon as one weapon do I have an iPad Android is about this so all kinds of armour time you could argue forever I mean I mean

324
00:53:50,000 --> 00:54:00,000
people who I would call hardliners to adjust agree with me cos I've published in our bed but but I'm just saying that you know

325
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:10,000
it's not so simple this is one I'm saying you know there are you but you have to decide which is right

326
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:20,000
this is a very complicated issues so anyway we have on

327
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:30,000
is Kirk Bill which is in the Senate it seems to be an old bands for a couple of months there's a Grace period people are working hard against it so

328
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:40,000
it's a very political thing in both countries I know it ok so

329
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:50,000
I saw it one together the discussion of two things are ran and the npt ok so I want to come

330
00:54:50,000 --> 00:55:00,000
to the npt cos I am bettered the Iranian discussion in the npt discussion because it came up naturally that's why but so they come

331
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:10,000
there's the next thing that's going to happen and I'm just quoting here Stormy Weather predicted for the npt review

332
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:20,000
ok so I'm actually quoting an article from I Daryl Kimball of the arms control Association I didn't have time to make

333
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Hoyts but in 2005 we had a disastrous and PT review that was under George Bush and

334
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:40,000
and the non-aligned countries are Egypt and Sweden and Denmark and Ireland and a whole bunch of countries

335
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:50,000
very angry particularly at the United States enjoyed wash it was a disastrous conference

336
00:55:50,000 --> 00:56:00,000
10 Barack Obama had delivered his speech that he wanted to eliminate nuclear weapons the United States cut with was very welcome

337
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:10,000
and and there was a productive conference and they had 22 interrelated this on that steps I'm not even going to try to

338
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:20,000
the two major ones were that the nuclear weapons countries should give a timetable for

339
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:30,000
going to 0 time table and the second thing is that the should be they should convene

340
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:40,000
a conference in the Middle East looking towards a nuclear free zone in the Middle East

341
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:50,000
that's very delicate because getting is real to come getting around is real to the table at the same time is difficult the whole thing is

342
00:56:50,000 --> 00:57:00,000
and not just the ram

343
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:10,000
they were in my personal

344
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:20,000
humble opinion Israel's interest a best served by a nuclear free zone in the Middle East if you are

345
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:30,000
hi Terry 0 weight in this cabinet ok I probably Gary know that

346
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:40,000
exaggeration of 0 way better than

347
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:50,000
so anyway I'm not even going to go through any of those but the following

348
00:57:50,000 --> 00:58:00,000
under these steps have been disappointing they basically banana existent OK there's been basically no follow through

349
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:10,000
under 22 points and so that's one of the reasons everyone who who knows anything about this is predicting that there going to be a storm

350
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:20,000
ok especially for the nuclear weapon States so you can look forward to some interesting news in May

351
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:30,000
ok I'm kind of running out of time so basically Obama raise the lot of

352
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:40,000
with is Prague speech and 2009 talking about the possibility of an a nuclear Free World

353
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:50,000
of course he he had bright away it won't be rich quickly and the us as long as the weapons exist we're going to have our little toys to

354
00:58:50,000 --> 00:59:00,000
ok so but anyway it was still the most why freight statement

355
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:10,000
since 1945 ok I mean so it was a breath of fresh air and

356
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:20,000
he won the Nobel Peace Prize ok probably premature early but who am I the quiver

357
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:30,000
ok so there are many arguments against nuclear weapons abolition I just going to pick

358
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:40,000
I'm ok because it it eliminates the torrents and to me that's the biggest argument

359
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:50,000
ok and it cannot be a cheat that's that's a different kinds of argument but in my opinion that's even stronger

360
00:59:50,000 --> 01:00:00,000
it's it's x I wouldn't say cannot but my personal statement is it's unlikely ok but that doesn't mean it's not design

361
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:10,000
and that doesn't mean that academics and particular shouldn't talk about it that's one of the things that I have in mind and we should have a long range

362
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:20,000
academics that's one of my lodge ariz we can try to look at head and so that there are really 2 questions is 1

363
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:30,000
the desirable in view of all of the difficulties with it conceptual

364
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:40,000
and then is it achievable if it is desirable it's only you should only ask the second question if the answer to

365
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:50,000
does yes it's desirable ok and I can't go through all the arguments but the terms is

366
01:00:50,000 --> 01:01:00,000
very interesting question I think I'm going to convene a little working group on it ok I've been thinking about it a lot for the last few

367
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:10,000
I'm ready to do some more serious research in this Arena ok but the point is that

368
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:20,000
it's never worked in the sense of Coke coercing others to do what you want which is the way it's offer news

369
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:30,000
and us diplomatic circles I don't know about Russian but but it certainly used in the US and

370
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:40,000
another problem with it as we heard about India and Pakistan it enables brinkmanship low-level

371
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:50,000
OK which is it it it another word introduces instabilities

372
01:01:50,000 --> 01:02:00,000
I'm sad the Torrance isn't what it's cracked out to be ok because by having the weapons you also went

373
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:10,000
instabilities in the system especially if you have a gressive basing mechanisms is very important

374
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Pakistan certainly is an example of that they have the turn in the but with a very aggressive pacing mode and threatening

375
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:30,000
so yes they've the term but is it stable how will it last are they they have delegated km

376
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:40,000
and in control of these local tactical weapons to come field commanders suppose you get a

377
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:50,000
field Commander wants the create mischief ok like you had somebody from Pakistan goes to Mum

378
01:02:50,000 --> 01:03:00,000
rain and nnn shoots everyone in the hotel so for write off

379
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:10,000
the end of the Indian pilot few years before that so these are actions which don't introduce love or stability

380
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:20,000
countries ok putting it mildly ok and of course the torrents requires rationality which is

381
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:30,000
what supply view ok accidental use as which which we talked about and

382
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:40,000
cost of one work against Terrace they want a real Terrace who's a suicide bombadier want step

383
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:50,000
structure ok so boy that that's it bad mixture ok

384
01:03:50,000 --> 01:04:00,000
and I think one of the points that people should not forget his deterrents requires a small number of weapon

385
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:10,000
well I would say 100 is overkill so it's less than 100 in my view I've been giving a number and I'll I'll keep giving it ok

386
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:20,000
I have 0 wait and Washington home basket that's what I think

387
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:30,000
so should we try to abolish nuclear weapons so really is it a good idea

388
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:40,000
so there's no risk free world what you have to do when you look at the arguments against ABBA

389
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:50,000
I've done my best to look at what I consider the serious ones they papers

390
01:04:50,000 --> 01:05:00,000
quickly criticise going to 0 because it's risky but the question is that what they never

391
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:10,000
is talk about the relative risks another one's minimising risks how do you minimise the risk you're never gonna live

392
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:20,000
risks it's impossible so how do you make the right question is not to eliminate risks you have to ask

393
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:30,000
question you every Side Of The Snows that you and the right question here is minimization of risk that's the right butcher

394
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:40,000
how do you minimise risk do you stay on the present course or do you Friday do something more creative and this

395
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:50,000
one of the creative things ok and so the other thing is that

396
01:05:50,000 --> 01:06:00,000
in and by itself is an important goal and if we want the npt the bee healthy with better be serious about it

397
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:10,000
how's the fireworks that I'm talking about OK and the nuclear weapons States had better take this into account you know

398
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:20,000
lock long-range how patients are the NPC PT States going to be it's very important

399
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:30,000
ok so yeah Obama has a mixed record he's inspired great hopes he's done the news

400
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:40,000
are treaty he's improved nucleus security he's tried he tried to engage Russian for it in furthest

401
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:50,000
actually that's that's a David slide those Atherton have dad the Russians effectively said no by the way so that

402
01:06:50,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Obama you know convito negotiation as you know ok the nuclear

403
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:10,000
pastor review in my view is the very important decide deployment strategy was only slightly modified from Rowley a years

404
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:20,000
we still have too many warnings on you know hair trigger alert

405
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:30,000
respect the North Korea he talks about strategic patience which is head in the sand as far as I'm concerned ok I'm very critical

406
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:40,000
up the North Korean lack of Engagement there I'm very critical of Obama

407
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:50,000
yes they're asking again and we're ignoring that and I think it's dumb and the last thing again this has a lot to do with

408
01:07:50,000 --> 01:08:00,000
is there modernizing nuclear weapons which again in the npt review is going to come up for tremendous predecessor

409
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:10,000
and it's good and in this day and age of budgetary restraints it should be criticise and in terms of strategic stability

410
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:20,000
be criticized so there's 0 to buzz words one is modernization and the other

411
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:30,000
maintenance so you have if you have nuclear weapons you have to maintain that they're usable and safe that's mate

412
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:40,000
without test that's important and the other is tomato night is the weapons making more accurate

413
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:50,000
and so forth and that really should not be done and the to get fused together and it's very hard to tell the detail because

414
01:08:50,000 --> 01:09:00,000
it's it's all classified it's it it's the typical track of large bureaucracies

415
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:10,000
ok so anyway I find some reason for optimism the CT video I want to talk about that I just want to see if you

416
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:20,000
that is the what is it the I forgot what it stands for it's the worldwide monitoring system for Tess

417
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:30,000
play it's it's it's basically an international thing it's it's technically fabulous I mean I am really impressed

418
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:40,000
they have a seismic detectors they look for radioactivity in the air and they they look for

419
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:50,000
there's one more thing I'm sorry I'm blanking but anyway they detected a half kiloton blast

420
01:09:50,000 --> 01:10:00,000
in North Korea an unannounced house gallatin stations triangular needed it they can tell it from earthquakes and and

421
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:10,000
conventional exploded the seismic what happens just briefly is that the seismix it's the rise time in the seismic 6

422
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:20,000
seafront from a chemical type explosion it's slower and the instruments have a fast enough response time so you could see the

423
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:30,000
you know overpressure it's it's quite wonderful and in several I think two out of the three of them

424
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Korean test wall unannounced they detected radioactivity in the air I think one of the z9 isotopes front from the

425
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:50,000
which is long-lived ok and so finally and I outlined this public opinion does count

426
01:10:50,000 --> 01:11:00,000
that's one of the things I take some comfort from there are many arms control organisations

427
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:10,000
I'm on the board of the council for a little war of the arms control Association it's is a wonderful organisation

428
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:20,000
you know in terms of giving out information and their journal is quite excellent ok and

429
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:30,000
peace action as a grass route to all other the good ok I think I've given the answers you know

430
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:40,000
is the present situation stable in my answer is with luck ok

431
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:50,000
a I gave my answer about abolition of nuclear weapons ok so anyway this

432
01:11:50,000 --> 01:12:00,000
me to do and why when I just stop you can look at it I'm sure this is only a partial list of all

433
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:10,000
can be done some of it can't be done without Russia ok but some can

434
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:20,000
ok for example we could reduce more rapidly to the level

435
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Russia has of launches end and the new start training Russia for example just as an example of Russia is below the limits imposed by the new

436
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:40,000
start reading those those limits going to affect when and something like 6 or 8 years or something I forget do you remember feel when they

437
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:50,000
the fact that we can accelerate those numbers you're not like typical arms control affect almost the day they are

438
01:12:50,000 --> 01:13:00,000
so it's always too slow for arms control people you know it's always welcome but always too slow

439
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:10,000
but you know your take what you can get but again I want to just repeat one thing the new start reading

440
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:20,000
the big thing about the big success of the new start reading in my view which was not stress by the newspapers for the comment

441
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:30,000
is the fact that the inspections are going on and the inspections in my view on much more critical than the number

442
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:40,000
that's such overkill whether it's 1000 or 1500 weapons I mean again this 100 number is overkill so Khmer

443
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:50,000
it's almost a relevant except symbolically whether you have 1000 or 1500 the lowest thousand you get into

444
01:13:50,000 --> 01:14:00,000
with how many does China have and how many Union are in South what they showed you so so thousands roughly that the critical point in which

445
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:10,000
war of the nuclear Powers nuclear weapons States I should say have two you know negotiate with each other not just the year

446
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:20,000
of course Rogers critical they're ok I'm going to stop and of course there's been a lot of questions but I'm happy for more of this

447
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:30,000
whatever yeah

448
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:50,000
another way of

449
01:14:50,000 --> 01:15:00,000
well first of all we already have it and it's conventional smart Warfare

450
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:10,000
haven't talked about it United States cause it's Global Strike which were developing and that's a whole other dimension it's not a nuclear arms

451
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:20,000
but it was too much for me to get into that but yes you're asking a very good question and or conventional military

452
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:30,000
hours are incredible and we can do now in many respects with conventional weapons what we could have done only

453
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:40,000
nuclear weapons 20 years ago even 10 years ago and this Global Strike which is a way to

454
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:50,000
right across the world with Precision with conventional weapons with missiles with a Cruise missiles

455
01:15:50,000 --> 01:16:00,000
and so forth is incredible and it's all sophisticated command-and-control stuff what's guidance yeah

456
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:10,000
well replace it in the sense that you don't have nuclear weapons

457
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:20,000
other people are just as scared as before so it's it's it's it's awesome an aggressive military posture and

458
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:30,000
in the day and age when we're really trying to replace that then we can no longer distinguish between

459
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:40,000
conventional arms control in nuclear arms control they will become merged I think as a subject as an intellectual subject as well as a practice

460
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:50,000
but I'm looking at head probably at least 10 years but in my view that they will come so you really asking a great question

461
01:16:50,000 --> 01:17:00,000
yes disturbing the peace action will have plenty of work for plenty of

462
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:10,000
I'm afraid OK but can I say that I'm not happy about that but it's a fact

463
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:20,000
do you know who in India Pakistan process that natural body no

464
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:30,000
is it ok in India lock Here's what I know I don't know more than

465
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:40,000
you know what I think is true in India is that the Armed Forces are under civilian control

466
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:50,000
but but are in Pakistan that is not true so Pakistan is not what you would

467
01:17:50,000 --> 01:18:00,000
a unitary state ok there is no single command the third I mean there is officially but de facto

468
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:10,000
we know that the Pakistani military is at least equal to the civilian branch but this

469
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:20,000
play whatever it is the security thing it seems to be quasi-independent I'm not sure

470
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:30,000
can see I mean my but one I'm afraid of us with this address I said it before but I just repeat it is this aggressive first

471
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:40,000
strike military nucleus posture of Pakistan is leading

472
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:50,000
delegation of authority to lower levels where there's a great danger of a road Commander so I see Pakistan

473
01:18:50,000 --> 01:19:00,000
place with the most danger of a rogue Commander ok and I think I'm not the only one who thinks this

474
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:10,000
by the way roughly to 150

475
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:20,000
200 it's more than 100 now ok they're making more all the time they make

476
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:30,000
fast as they can as far as we can tell OK no India seems to be more relaxed

477
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:40,000
loud it both in terms of their aggressive-passive they say they won't fire first in the has a much more reasonable stated policy of use

478
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:50,000
they they're much more laid-back they they say they won't use them first they

479
01:19:50,000 --> 01:20:00,000
say the Pakistan is a just going much much too far but on the Indian side the problem that I

480
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:10,000
is there not trying for the political solution another words they're past their deployment posture is more sensible

481
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:20,000
but they're focused on China Sea so but they are not India my big criticism of India is

482
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:30,000
I'm not solving the problem ok man I come back to that right

483
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:40,000
the Bing much too slow in in trying to heal problems like Cashmere and other

484
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:50,000
points in the relationship ok I mean they're not gonna disappear overnight but they could they could do things

485
01:20:50,000 --> 01:21:00,000
ok and I can point the some literature but I'm I'm not a real expert by the way they're not being the United States of not being even-handed

486
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:10,000
anatom mistake that's a basic American mistake so you know

487
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:20,000
critical since the beginning I'm not the only one you know on this basis but I think the predictable is happening

488
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:30,000
just wondering Pakistan into a more frenzied state of the value of nuclear weapons development ok it's on for

489
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:40,000
but we're doing something we don't want to see happen ok we deployment one 1 hour and and

490
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:50,000
encourage it in directly on the other so it's a contradictory policy unfortunate

491
01:21:50,000 --> 01:22:00,000
they should no better but they have their the learning commercial interest override

492
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:10,000
you know that this tug of war write that Tasmania

493
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:20,000
so

494
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:30,000
underbrush somehow right it's

495
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:50,000
well we also make military hardware sales turn to India which is increasing that was all

496
01:22:50,000 --> 01:23:00,000
it was one of the other things from the Obama visit the sale of conventional military equipment 2nd is going up

497
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:10,000
ok for the first time in a long time so that was a big success I guess yes

498
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:20,000
yes I forgot to mention that ok you reminded me

499
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:30,000
call Cathy ok thank you thank you for coming
