please\ninterrupt at any time\nand ask questions, OK?\nI've sort of got a big panorama\nof things to talk about.\nIt's basically impossible\nto cover everything, OK?\nI mean, basically I\nadvertise this talk\nas an outlook for the\nfuture, and of course, that's\ntoo broad.\nSo I've picked a\nfew things which\nare of special interest\nto me, and what"], "60": [1, 170, "Now, as you know, what\nI talk about often\nis in comparing the danger\nto the planet, and of course,\nits population, of climate\nchange and nuclear war.\nSo climate change is just--\nI think the probability is\npretty close to 100%.\nI don't know how to quantify\nit, but it's fairly certain\nthat we are into an\nera of global warming\nand its consequences.\nAnd this is a slow,\nsteady thing in terms\nof probability of occurrence\nwith all its ramifications.\nNuclear war is much\neasier to avoid,\nbut if it happens-- and\nof course, every day\nthe probability is very low.\nThat's what I call the\nprobability structure.\nSo the probability of a nuclear\nwar any specific day is low.\nThe cumulative probability\nis higher, of course.\nAnd if that event occurs,\nit's catastrophic.\nSo what happens is the\ndestruction just starts in.\nThe destruction, of course,\nis local in the place\nwhere the weapon blows up.\nThe destruction, it depends\nhow many bombs go off\nand how much soot\ngoes into the air,\nbut we could have\nglobal consequences\nif there are enough of them.\nA so-called nuclear winter.\nSo having said that, I\njust want to talk about--\nand this is the fear, of course.\nAnd that's what keeps some of\nus worrying about this problem\nand working on it.\nSo basically I want to talk\nabout the possible pathways\nto nuclear war.\nI'll talk a little bit\nabout proliferation\nand the\nNon-Proliferation Treaty.\nI'll say just a few words\nabout the possibility\nof nuclear weapons abolition.\nI'll talk a wee bit about\nObama's record and the outlook.\nThat's a pretty\nambitious agenda."], "230": [2, 190, "There are endless debates about\nthe utility of nuclear weapons.\nSome people are at\nleast pro having them.\nNot using them, but having\nthem, because, of course,\nthey were pro in the one\ncase that they were used,\nand of course, we used them\non Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\nOne group of people\nsays that actually saved\nlives because the war ended\nmore quicker that way.\nI think that's highly\ndebatable, but it's\na point of view which is held.\nSo it actually saved casualties\nand it prevented World War III.\nThese are some of the arguments.\nI'm not trying to\ngive all of them,\nbut these are arguments that\nyou can find in the literature.\nAnd you can find books, and\nthis just goes back and forth.\nAnd of course, the\ncounter argument\nwas that the use of\natomic weapons in Japan\nwas not necessary.\nWhat was really\nnecessary was to agree\nthat the Emperor could\nstay on, and that\nturned out to be the\nkey that people argue.\nAnd certainly almost\neveryone agrees\nthat the use of the\nsecond bomb in Nagasaki\nwas something that should\nnot have been done.\nI think there's much\nmore agreement to that.\nThere are books that\nthis use was actually\nthe first step of the Cold War.\nOf course, many\nJapanese civilians\nwere killed, several\nhundred thousand,\nand two cities were destroyed.\nOn the other hand, we destroyed\nalmost all the major cities\nin Japan by\nconventional weapons.\nAnd of course, Japan did not\nhave an unblemished record\nin Korea and China and so forth.\nI'm not going to go into\nthat, but the moral dimensions\nof World War II are\npretty horrible.\nI'll stop there.\nThe inhibition about\nkilling civilians\npretty much disappeared\nin World War I\nand was just totally ignored\nin World War II, I would say.\nAnd in the post-war\nera, the argument\nis that you didn't\nneed nuclear weapons\nto prevent a war between the\nUnited States and the Soviet\nUnion.\nI pretty much think\nthat's the case myself."], "420": [3, 300, "There have been no nuclear\nwars since the first two\nweapons were used.\nOf course, there have\nbeen many explosions,\nbut they were tests.\nSo was that deterrence?\nThere's a theory\nabout nuclear taboo\nbecause they're\nmorally so awful.\nI'm a bit skeptical,\nbut it's a theory\nthat's out there by an\nimportant Yale sociologist.\nIs it luck, other\nreasons, and so forth.\nSo many of us-- well, I'll\ngive you some of my conclusions\nat the end, but the\ncrucial question\nis does the possession\nof nuclear weapons\nmake a country more secure?\nYou heard this in\nthe case of Ukraine\nwhen the Russians took the\nCrimean, when they basically\nhave their stealth invasion\nof the Ukraine, which\nis going on as we speak.\nWould a Ukrainian nuclear\nweapon deter them?\nAnd when the Soviet Union\nbroke up in the end of 1991,\nthere was a lot of discussion\nabout what would happen\nto all the nuclear weapons.\nThey were mostly in Russia,\nUkraine, and Kazakhstan.\nAnd we managed to\npersuade the Ukrainians--\nthey were the toughest--\nand the Kazakhs\nto give all those\nweapons to Russia.\nBut in fact, one of the\nthings-- and there's\na lot of history here-- but\none of the best articles\nthat I've read, and I\nthink it's obviously true,\nstates that in fact the Ukraine\nand Kazakhstan never really\nowned those weapons.\nThey were really owned\nby the Soviet Union.\nThe Ukrainian army was\nnot prepared to take them\nin any way.\nThey really didn't have an army.\nThey hardly have an army now,\n20 years later or something.\nSo there's no realistic\nway that the Ukrainians\nhad a nuclear weapon\nthat could be used.\nThey had possession\nof nuclear weapons,\nbut not the actual\nability to use them.\nSo it's a very funny thing.\nIt's a very special case,\nand it's a very funny thing.\nBut that argument is heard.\nI would say more important,\nor at least as important,\nis is the present\nsituation stable?\nThis is a key question.\nMany people doubt it\nthat our good fortune\nin not having any nuclear\nexchanges since 1945\nis purely deterrence.\nif there isn't an element of\nluck or other issues involved.\nAnd each specific\ncase is different.\nSo it's hard to generalize.\nI mean, one of the issues,\none of the differences\nbetween physics\nand arms control,\nis how the lack\nin arms control is\nthe lack, really, of science.\nHow much more difficult the\nsituation is to evaluate.\nAnd of course, now\nwith relationships\nbetween the United\nStates and Russian,\nin fact, the whole west and\nRussia at a low point, probably\na few decade old low point,\nthe future of arms control\nseems bleak at this\nmoment, I have to say.\nIt's hard to maintain optimism.\nAnd finally there's\nthis perennial question\nabout abolishing\nnuclear weapons, which\nis certainly more and more\nremote as time goes on.\nBut I think as\nacademics we should\nthink about it, because these\nare very important issues.\nSo we should think long-range\nis what I'm saying.\nIt's not going to happen\nquickly, obviously.\nIf at all.\nBut is it desirable?\nThere are two\nseparate questions.\nIs it desirable and\nis it going to happen."], "720": [4, 160, "there were intense discussions\ninside of the Manhattan Project\nbefore the public knew about it.\nAnd there was this\nfamous Franck Report,\nand the conclusions of the\nFranck Report are here.\nUse the bomb for a\ndemonstration, not on cities.\nShare the secret.\nThe secret-- not necessary\nthe details of how to make it.\nI don't think anyone\never proposed that.\nWhat's meant here is share\nthe secret of its existence\nbefore its use.\nThat's what they're\ntalking about.\nBecause the use without notice,\nparticularly without notice\nto the Soviet\nUnion, would ensure\nthe start of a war, a Cold\nWar, and a nuclear arms race.\nAnd that's exactly what\nthe scientists predicted.\nThese were very\nsophisticated people.\nFranck was a Nobel\nLaureate from Germany\nwho escaped from Hitler.\nAnd there were many other\nthings that happened.\nThe scientists banded together.\nThey formed the Bulletin\nof the Atomic Scientists,\nthe Federation of Atomic\nScientists, which still goes on\nalthough it's not\nas strong as it was.\nAnd they developed this\nAcheson-Lilienthal plan,\nin which Oppenheimer\nplayed a major role.\nAnd it ended up as the\nBaruch plan, which was not\nreally what was proposed, and\nit was turned down immediately\nby the Soviet Union\nfor various reasons.\nI can go into them, but I won't.\nSo the era of possible\narms control in 1945,\n1946, collapsed in the beginning\nof the Cold War period.\nAnd what the scientists\nfeared the most happened.\nAnd the other thing\nis-- and you hear this\nfrom the people who\nfirst developed the bomb\nand then worked as actively\nas they could against it,\nand many of them were at MIT."], "880": [5, 110, "Victor Weisskopf.\nThere was Hans\nBethe from Cornell.\nAnd there was just a\nwhole group of people,\nvery prominent scientists.\nAnd Hans Bethe-- both Viki\nWeisskopf and Hans Bethe\ntold me personally, but they\nsaid it many times in public,\nthat when we realized\nin about 1946\nthat there was no agreement\nwas going to happen,\nwe asked ourselves, what is the\nworst thing that could happen?\nAnd they said, we would\nbuild a hundred weapons.\n100.\nAnd the Russians would\nbuild 100 weapons.\nAnd then we would face each\nother down with 100 weapons.\nThat was the worst these\nsophisticated, bright men could\nimagine in 1946.\nSo what did people expect?\nFirst, the atomic\nscientists, they\nthought that the nuclear\nweapon was so horrible\nit would change the\nbehavior of mankind.\nAnd politicians like\nChurchill and Roosevelt\nbelieved that this\npowerful weapon\nwould allow England\nand the United States,\nwith their monopoly,\nto be able to say\nthe way the world evolved.\nSo both sides were wrong.\nTypical.\nSo the influence that it had\nhas been reasonably small."], "990": [6, 50, "we wanted them to do.\nFor example, they took\nover Eastern Europe.\nWe hated that.\nThey did it.\nEt cetera.\nYou know, it just\ngoes on and on.\nThe Communists took China.\nWe hated that.\nThe list of things-- I just\nmentioned a few major ones.\nSo that's what I mean by\nits coercive influence.\nIts possession became a status\nsymbol almost right away.\nBut there is some\ndeterrence in it.\nDeterrence isn't\ncompletely useless.\nDeterrence and abhorrence,\na combination of the two\nof them I think,\nworks to some extent."], "1040": [7, 70, "Now, I want you to\nlook at this graph.\nThis is the buildup of\nnuclear weapons between us\nand the Soviet Union.\nAnd you notice this scale?\n5,000, 10,000.\n100 is down here.\nThe Soviet Union blew\nup their first bomb\nfour years after we\ndid, as predicted.\nNot only was it predicted\nthat they would get the bomb,\nbut that it would take\nthem three to five years.\nThat was the number that was\ngiven by the atomic scientists.\nAnd it was hotly disputed\nin Washington, but so what.\nAnd again, we built up\nto astronomical numbers.\nTens of thousands of weapons.\nAnd finally we\nhave a slow decline\nthrough nuclear arms\ncontrol agreements\nand through terrifying events,\nlike the Cuban Missile Crisis."], "1110": [8, 190, "And the spirit of\nthat build up is,\nI think, exemplified\nin this great cartoon,\nwhich you can read for yourself,\nfrom the middle of the Cold\nWar.\nAnd I think this says the story.\nAUDIENCE: Is that\nthe only reason?\nPROFESSOR: Fear.\nAUDIENCE: Fear is\nthe only reason?\nPROFESSOR: Fear.\nWell, I mean, they developed\nall kinds of fancy strategies,\nbut at the heart of it was fear.\nJust plain fear of a\ndevastating first strike.\nAnd then you had to build up\ncounterforce capabilities,\nbe able to absorb\nthe first strike,\nand able to destroy the\nenemy after the first strike.\nBut the astronomical\nnumber was mad.\nAnd it was called MAD,\nMutual Assured Destruction.\nIt was literally called MAD.\nThose of us looking\nfrom the outside--\nbut we weren't really\non the outside,\nbecause we would have been the\nvictims-- thought it was mad.\nBut you know, logic\nis in a certain sense,\nirrelevant in this situation.\nI mean, there's such a\ngrip of fear on both sides.\nAnd it's really true.\nI sat through the\nCuban Missile Crisis\npersonally with a\ndedicated Russian\nCommunist who had actually\ncome to work in my laboratory.\nIt was a very\ninteresting experience.\nHe thought it was all the\nfault of the United States.\nMost of the people\nthought it was\nthe fault of the Soviet Union.\nMost of the people here.\nBut I thought they were\nboth at fault. You know,\nI thought-- not that they\nwere equally nice people,\nbut that they were just\noperating from too much fear.\nSo they overdid it.\nYou know, this business\nof a hundred weapons.\nI often ask students in class\nhow many weapons are enough,\nand nobody knows how to\nanswer that question.\nBut then I say,\nwell, how many cities\nare you willing to give up?\nYou now, in the case of\nthe Russians, is it Moscow?\nLeningrad?\nThat's two cities.\nAnd there's a famous exchange\nbetween Jerome Wiesner, who\nwas ex-president of\nMIT, and also a science\nadviser the Kennedy, with\nGorbachev where he asked them\nexactly this question.\nAnd Gorbachev was just amazed.\nSo well, there you go.\nSo I think it's fear\nand distrust, of course.\nFear and distrust,\nthey go together.\nAnd that's very important.\nI just want to point out that\none of our nuclear submarines--"], "1300": [9, 60, "They're loaded a little less\nnow, but it doesn't matter.\nI don't change this slide.\nBut basically they have 100\nand 300 kiloton warheads.\nSo in order of magnitude,\nlarger than the Hiroshima weapon\non Nagasaki.\nAnd each submarine has a\nmaximum loading, it should say,\nof 96 warheads.\nThey're independently targeted.\nYou can destroy 96 targets.\nAfter firing, it takes 10 or\n15 minutes to reach Russia.\nSo you could-- it's\nkind of staggering.\nSo the total explosive\npower is three times that\nof World War II.\nOne submarine.\nIt's incredible."], "1360": [10, 170, "This is the present global\ninventory, more or less.\nYou can see-- this is\nthe number that counts.\nThese are the\nstrategic warheads,\nand you can see there\nthe order of 1,500, which\nis this new START Treaty limit.\nWe're just about at\nthat limit anyway.\nAnd that all the other countries\nhave typically a few hundred\nat the most.\nThis is all guesswork\nas to the numbers.\nIt's not known.\nI think 10 for North\nKorea is probably\na factor of two to\nthree high, but it\ngives an order of magnitude.\nThis is guesswork, frankly,\nbecause these are all secret.\nSo people do the best they can.\nThis is a table from Hans\nKristensen and the Federation\nof American Scientists who keeps\ntrack of these things as well\nas he can.\nAUDIENCE: How can they\nmake these guesses?\nPROFESSOR: Oh, they\nlook at the literature\nand they look at\nbudgets and they\nlook at satellite pictures.\nThey do their best.\nI think they have the\nright order of magnitude,\nbut nobody claims they\nknow the exact number.\nI mean, if you talk to Hans\nKristensen, who's very good,\nand who knows what he's doing,\nhe's very smart and competent.\nHe'll tell you this\nis educated guesswork.\nBut it's more or\nless-- it's enough.\nYou know, I mean, 90\nor a hundred weapons.\nIt's all-- a hundred\nweapons is overkill.\nAUDIENCE: But is\nit usually the case\nwhere the countries would\nwant to make that number\nlook higher or lower than that?\nPROFESSOR: They want it\nto be higher so that--\nAUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].\nPROFESSOR: Right?\nExcept for Israel, which doesn't\nwant to admit it has any,\nbut they want it known anyway.\nSo it's a complex game.\nBut for most of the\nother countries,\nthey say it's for deterrence.\nSo it's better to let your\nadversary know what you've got.\nChina is also very coy\nabout their numbers,\nbecause they have\nrelatively few numbers,\nand they want to keep this--\npositions secret and all\nof that.\nSo they don't want to have-- and\nthey don't keep their missiles\non alert either.\nChina's a very\ninteresting country\nwith respect to nuclear weapons.\nAnd perhaps exceptional."], "1530": [11, 30, "So the pathways to nuclear\nescalation and war,\nas I've stressed, is fear.\nFear, to me, is\nthe biggest factor.\nI'm sure people\nwill argue with me.\nEvery point I'm\nmaking at some level\nas controversial, by the way.\nI'm not trying to\nhide it, but it's\njust I can't give\nyou every nuance."], "1560": [12, 340, "People write books\nabout each subject.\nSo, you know, have\nto oversimplify it.\nBut anyway, I consider the\ntwo possible pathways to War.\nOne is an accidental launch\nbetween the United States\nand Russia.\nAnd the other is escalation\nfrom conventional war\nin India and Pakistan.\nNow, somewhat less likely is\nNorth Korea's use of a weapon,\nbut I suspect they\nwon't, because I\nthink that they are constrained\nby other military reasons\non the Korean peninsula.\nSo North Korea wants to\nrattle the sword, so to speak,\nbut they, I think, really\nwant it for both deterrence\nand, as far as I can tell,\nfor the survivability\nof the regime.\nWhich is a whole\nother-- but that\ncomes into all these things.\nThat's why each case is special.\nNorth Korea's a\nvery special case.\nIt's a very odd\ngovernment, and so forth.\nNow, we had-- Vipin Narang\ntalked about escalation\nfrom conventional war, and he\ntalked about the deployment.\nOne of the things\nhe talks about,\nwhich I think is very\nsound, is that this whole\nissue when you talk\nabout deterrence,\nit isn't just numbers.\nThere's a whole other\ndimension, at least.\nAnd one is the\ndeployment posture.\nAnd Pakistan has a very\naggressive deployment posture,\nbecause they feel inferior in\nconventional weapons to India.\nAnd they feel threatened\nby India in many ways.\nAnd they've already been\npartitioned by India\nwhen the country broke up into\nthe eastern and western part,\nBangladesh and India.\nSo there's a historic enmity\nbetween the two, which\nneeds to be-- and I want\nto-- it needs to be fixed.\nAnd I have to say,\npersonally, that I\nwas very disappointed\nwith Obama's visit\nto India in many respects.\nYou know, I look at\nthe nuclear issue,\nand that's one of my lenses.\nIt isn't my sole lens, but\nit's an important focus for me.\nAnd what I see is Obama talks\nabout the climate, which\nis excellent, then he gets\non this very poor policy\nof selling nuclear energy,\nnuclear reactors, to India\nand not exempting India\nfrom the restrictions that\nused to be in place\nbefore the Bush\nadministration of exempting\nIndia from the restrictions\nwe've placed on\nthem because they\nviolated the Non-Proliferation\nTreaty and tested weapons.\nNow of course,\nPakistan did so, also.\nBut the point is that\nwe just aggravate\nthe Indian-Pakistan tension.\nAs far as I can tell, and\nI just read The New York\nTimes, you know, and listen to\nthe BBC, as far as I can tell,\nthe subject of\ntreating Pakistan,\nof defusing the tension with\nPakistan, did not arise.\nAs far as I can.\nAt least these there was\nno public mention of it.\nAnd I was very disappointed.\nAnd Obama's also trying to\ndraw-- India is more concerned\nwith China than with Pakistan.\nThis is a sort of\nthree-way dance,\nif you want to put it that way.\nAnd so it's more complicated\nthan a bipolar interaction.\nIt's a three-way game where\nChina frightens India, India\nfrightens Pakistan.\nChina ends up helping\nPakistan with nuclear issues\nand nuclear weapons issues.\nThey originally gave Pakistan\nthe design for the bomb.\nSo this is something\nthat if India\nwants to solve this\nissue of Pakistan's\naggressive deployment,\nthey either\nhave to do it by force,\nwhich won't work,\nbecause India has been deterred.\nOr they have to do\nit through diplomacy,\nand it always ends\nup with this message.\nYou can use force,\nwhich won't work,\nor you can use diplomacy,\nwhich has a chance.\nWhich is difficult,\nbut has a chance.\nThose are the two ways\nto solve the problem."], "1900": [13, 110, "Well, basically the\nmost likely path\nis a malfunctioning of\nthe Early Warning system.\nSo here's a chilling quote\nfrom Vice President Cheney,\nwhen he was Vice President.\nI'll just let

button.\nIt's a virtual button.\nSo this is chilling.\nAnd you ask, what\nabout the Constitution?\nWhat about consulting?\nWhat about anything?\nNo, because of the 10-minute,\nthe 30-minute launch

system,\nsomebody who really wants\nthe United States and Russia\nto destroy each other,\nhacks into the Early\nWarning system of either side.\nJust imagine that.\nThat's a nightmare.\nSo the irony, as I mentioned,\nis that the safety of each side\ndepends on the other\nside not launching.\nAnd then of course, there's\nthe political question,\nwhy do we persist?\nObama promised to do\nsomething about it\nwhen he came to office,\nbut he has given it up.\nHe's clearly given it\nup without explanation.\nBut it was one of his promises.\nYeah?\nAUDIENCE: You would think\neven with the tensions that\nexist that we would both be\nbetter off if this system were\nup.\nPROFESSOR: Of course.\nThe more tension there is,\nthe more scary this is.\nIt's less scary when there's\nno tension, obviously.\nIt's fear, again.\nAnd all the things\nthat go with fear.\nAUDIENCE: And distrust.\nPROFESSOR: Fear-- yeah.\nI'm going taking them\nalmost as synonymous.\nDistrust because the other\nside has the capability\nto destroy you.\nAnd a second strike\ncapability, in the language\nof Cold War-- you\nknow, you ask why\nit happens with all\nthis strategic doctrine,\nbut a second strike capability\nand launch on warning\nare physically identical\nwith a first strike posture.\nSo you cannot tell.\nI mean, the other side\ntells you, we love you.\nBut it's like having a\nguest over for

Russia,\nthe NPT is not taken as\nseriously as it should be.\nAnd I think it's very important.\nThe NPT is taken seriously\nfor half of what it does.\nNamely, it says that\npeople should not\nacquire

they\ndon't produce enough enriched\nuranium for power needs.\nBut they do produce\nenough for weapons.\nAnd that's been clear since\nthe beginning of the program,\ndespite what is said.\nAnd so there's been a\ntremendous tension there.\nI just want to talk a little bit\nabout the ongoing negotiations.\nThey're making a\nlot of news now.\nIt's very important, because\nwe have an interim agreement,\nand this is the\ntime, six months--\nit's really four months\non the political level\nand six months on\nthe technical level,\nto reach a final agreement.\nThat's what was set up.\nI mean, the first one was\nsupposed to be six months.\nIt was extended.\nWell, excuse me.\nThe first phase agreement\nwas for six months,\nand then it's been\nextended-- it's not on here--\nbut it's been extended\nfor six more months.\nSo the deadline for\nthe political agreement\nis in March, and then\nin June, I think,\nis the deadline, the\nofficial deadline.\nPeople are skeptical,\nbut I don't know.\nThere are some technical issues.\nThe Iraq reactor can\nproduce plutonium.\nBut there are a simple\nsolutions to that.\nThere are simple\ntechnical fixes,\nand Iran has agreed to\nthem, as I understand it.\nSo that the amount of plutonium\nproduction from the Iraq\nreactor will be small.\nIn the interim\nagreement there's not\nsupposed to be any\nadditional sanctions.\nThat's very important in\nterms of the US Congress,\nbecause bills have circulated\ndemanding new sanctions.\nBut they're probably in\nabeyance, fortunately.\nThere are really four\nparties involved,\nthe two official\nparties and then the\nhardliners on both sides.\nSo this is a\ncomplex negotiation.\nWithin each side it's complex.\nI can't go into all of it.\nAnd I think people know\nwhat's going on better\nhere on the American side.\nBut the real issue, as far as\nI can see it, in terms of Iran,\nwhat Iran wants is\nto have, I think,\nthe Ayatollah said something\nlike 15,000 centrifuges.\nThe West, the most hardline\npeople in the West say zero.\nNetanyahu, for example.\nZero is the only acceptable\nnumber of centrifuges.\nAnd that's why he's\ncampaigning so hard against it,\nbecause he knows\nthat there will be\nno deal with zero centrifuges.\nSo he already knows in\nadvance that what he wants\nis not possible.\nAUDIENCE: How many do\nthey need to really power\na nuclear power\nplant in the future?\nPROFESSOR: Well, they need\nprobably 20,000 advanced ones.\nAdvanced ones, not what they\nhave, the so-called P1s.\nOnes that work really well.\nI don't know off\nthe top of my head,\nbut to supply-- what is it?\nBushehr?\nIs that the right\npronunciation?--\nthe Bushehr reactor.\nWhich they don't\nneed, by the way,\nbecause Russia's going\nto supply the fuel.\nBut they don't quite\ntrust Russia, of course,\nfor reasonable reasons, I think.\nBut anyway, this whole\nbusiness is so murky,\nin my personal opinion.\nIt's hard to tell facts\nfrom motive, in my opinion.\nI don't think I can\ndo it, honestly.\nI'll talk with you\nprivately if you want,\nbut I don't think I can\nreally evaluate it in a way\nthat I would consider\nsatisfactory.\nI can speculate.\nThat's what I can do.\nBut the point is-- you\nknow, there's an old saying\nthat the ideal solution gets in\nthe way of the good solution.\nThe good solution,\nin my opinion,\nis pretty much to continue the\ninterim agreement that we have.\nWhy is that good?\nBecause what people are not\ntalking about in the United\nStates is the best thing\nabout the whole negotiation.\nNamely, that Iran keeps\nsaying they don't want\nto develop nuclear weapons.\nAnd there's a fatwa.\nThat's excellent.\nSecond, Iran says that they\nwant to be part of the NPT.\nThey are enduring-- and\nI'm going to use that word,\nenduring-- the most\nrigorous inspection\nregime that the IAEA, that's\nthe international agency that\ninspects, the\nInternational Atomic Energy\nAgency-- they are enduring\nthe most rigorous inspections\nthat any country ever endured.\nThose are two excellent things.\nThere are people on the\nground all the time.\nPeople say, well,\nthey can break out.\nYes, they can break\nout if they want to.\nThey will only\nagree to all of this\nif it's in their self-interest.\nNobody can expect anything\nmore of them or us.\nSo I think what we've got is the\nbest possible solution that's\nfeasible.\nAnd if they kick inspectors out\nand decide to go for a bomb,\nbecause it's close to\nimpossible for them\nto do a bomb without kicking\nthe inspectors out, and--\nAUDIENCE: Even if they\nhave hidden sites?\nPROFESSOR: Well, they\nwould have to then develop\nso many thousand\nmore centrifuges\nand have that material\nand no news could leak out\nand all of that stuff.\nThere are opposition groups.\nWe found out about some of the\nsites-- I forget which one.\nThe one that's underground.\nI forgot the name of it--\nthrough dissenters in Iran.\nIt always can happen.\nThe Soviet Union found out\nabout the Manhattan Project\nin a most remarkable way.\nI want to talk about\nthat for a minute,\nbecause that's really important.\nIn 1940, a Soviet\nnuclear physicist,\na very good one named\nFlyorov, realized\nthat all the publications\nabout fission\nin the United States, England,\nand France had stopped.\nAnd he went to Stalin\nand said, the West\nis developing an\natomic bomb, based\non what was not appearing\nin the literature.\nThis is remarkable.\nAnd it's a fact.\nOf course, the Soviet\nUnion had spies,\nand they found out about\nthe Manhattan Project\nthrough the spies.\nBut Flyorov, just reading\nthe physical review--\nthis is a remarkable story\nwhich should not be ignored.\nSo I think we'd find out.\nMaybe slowly, but, you know.\nAnd if they really want\nthe weapon as a deterrent,\nthey've got to show\nus that they have it,\nlike North Korea's done.\nThere are all kinds of\nsteps, and one weapon\nisn't good enough.\nI mean, I wrote an\nop ed with Jim Walsh\nthat this whole break out\ntime thing is too short.\nYou know, the calculations,\nbecause it assumes one weapon.\nSo I have an op ed in\nReuters about this.\nSo there are all\nkinds of arguments.\nI mean, you could argue forever.\nI mean, I don't\nexpect people who\nare what I would call\nhardliners to adjust\nagree with me because\nI've published an op ed.\nBut I'm just saying-- it's not\nso simple, is what I'm saying.\nThere are arguments.\nYou have to decide which\nis right, because these\nare very complicated issues.\nSo anyway, we have our\nMenendez-Kirk bill,\nwhich is in the Senate.\nIt seems to be in abeyance\nfor a couple of months.\nThere's a grace period.\nPeople are working\nhard against it,\nso it's a very political\nthing in both countries.\nI know it."], "3280": [18, 230, "and the NPT.\nSo I want to come\nback to the NPT,\nbecause I embedded the\nIranian discussion in the NPT\ndiscussion.\nBecause it came up\nnaturally, that's why.\nBut so to come back to\nit, the next thing that's\ngoing to happen, and\nI'm just quoting here,\nStormy weather predicted for\nthe NPT review in May at the UN.\nSo I'm actually\nquoting an article\nfrom Daryl Kimball of the\nArms Control Association.\nI didn't have time to\nmake all the points,\nbut in 2005 we had a\ndisastrous NPT review.\nThat was under George Bush,\nand the nonaligned countries,\nEgypt and Sweden and\nDenmark and Ireland\nand a whole bunch of\ncountries were very angry.\nParticularly at the United\nStates and George Bush.\nIt was a disastrous conference.\n2010, Barack Obama had\ndelivered his speech\nthat he wanted to\neliminate nuclear weapons.\nThe United States\nwas very welcome,\nand it was a\nproductive conference.\nAnd they had 22 interrelated\ndisarmament steps.\nI'm not even going to\ntry to repeat them.\nThe two major ones were that\nthe nuclear weapons countries\nshould give a timetable\nfor going to zero.\nA timetable.\nAnd the second\nthing is that they\nshould convene a\nconference in the Middle\nEast looking towards a\nnuclear-free zone in the Middle\nEast.\nThat's very delicate,\nbecause getting Israel\nto come, getting Iran and Israel\nto the table at the same time\nis difficult. The whole thing\nis difficult, and not just Iran.\nAUDIENCE: But the concept was\noriginally started by Iran\nand, I think Egypt, but Israel\nwas a party to it at one point,\ntoo.\nPROFESSOR: They were?\nAUDIENCE: They were interested.\nThey were considering.\nPROFESSOR: In my\npersonal humble opinion,\nIsrael's interests\nare best served\nby a nuclear-free zone\nin the Middle East.\nIf you ask me.\nI carry zero weight in\nNetanyahu's cabinet.\nBelieve me.\nI probably carry-- no, that's\nan exaggeration of my influence.\nZero weight is better\nthan what I have.\nSo anyway, I'm not even going\nto go through any of those,\nbut the follow through on these\nsteps have been disappointing.\nThey've basically\nbeen nonexistent.\nThere's been basically no\nfollow through on the 22 points.\nAnd so that's one of\nthe reasons everyone\nwho knows anything about\nthis is predicting that it's\nstormy weather ahead, especially\nfor the nuclear weapons states.\nSo you can look forward to\nsome interesting news in May.\nI'm kind of running out of\ntime, so basically Obama"], "3510": [19, 60, "in 2009 talking\nabout the possibility\nof a nuclear-free world.\nOf course, he hedged right away,\nit won't be reached quickly.\nAnd the US, as long\nas the weapons exist,\nwe're going to have\nour little toys, too.\nBut anyway, it was still the\nmost forthright statement\nsince 1945.\nI mean, so it was a\nbreath of fresh air.\nAnd he won the\nNobel Peace Prize.\nProbably prematurely,\nbut who am I to quibble?\nSo there are many arguments\nagainst nuclear

in my opinion\nthat's even stronger.\nI wouldn't say cannot, but\nmy personal statement is\nit's unlikely.\nBut that doesn't mean\nit's not desirable.\nAnd that doesn't mean that\nacademics, in particular,\nshouldn't talk about it.\nThat's one of the things\nthat I have in mind,\nand we should have a\nlong-range view, academics.\nThat's one of our luxuries.\nWe can try to look ahead.\nAnd so there are\nreally two questions.\nOne, is it desirable in view\nof all of the difficulties\nwith it conceptually?\nAnd then, is it achievable\nif it is desirable?\nYou should only ask\nthe second question\nif the answer to the first\nis yes, it's desirable.\nAnd I can't go through\nall the arguments,"], "3650": [21, 210, "I think I'm going to convene\na little working group on it.\nI've been thinking about it\na lot for the last few years,\nand I'm ready to do some more\nserious research in this arena.\nBut the point is that\nit's never worked\nin the sense of coercing\nothers to do what you want,\nwhich is the way it's often\nused in US diplomatic circles.\nI don't know about Russia, but\nit's certainly used in the US.\nAnd another problem\nwith it, as we\nheard about India\nand Pakistan, is it\nenables brinkmanship,\nlow-level brinkmanship.\nIn other words it\nintroduces instabilities,\nis what I'm saying.\nDeterrence isn't what\nit's cracked out to be,\nbecause by having\nthe weapons, you also\nintroduce instabilities\nin the system,\nespecially if you have\naggressive basing mechanisms.\nThis is very important.\nAnd Pakistan certainly\nis an example of that.\nThey have deterred India, but\nwith a very aggressive basing\nmode and threatening verbally.\nSo, yes, they've deterred,\nbut is it stable?\nHow will it last?\nThey have delegated\ncommand and control\nof these local tactical\nweapons to field commanders.\nSuppose you get a\nrogue field commander\nwho wants to create mischief.\nLike you had somebody from\nPakistan goes to Mumbai,\nand shoots everyone in\nthe hotel and so forth.\nOr when they entered the\nIndian parliament a few years\nbefore that.\nSo these are actions which don't\nintroduce love or stability\nbetween countries.\nPutting it mildly.\nAnd of course, deterrence\nrequires rationality,\nwhich is in short supply.\nMy view.\nAccidental use, which\nwe've talked about.\nAnd of course, it won't\nwork against terrorists.\nThey want-- a real terrorist\nwho's a suicide bombardier\nwants death and destruction.\nSo, boy, that's a bad mixture.\nAnd I think one of the points\nthat people should not forget\nis deterrence requires a\nsmall number of weapons.\nAUDIENCE: How many is small?\nPROFESSOR: Well, I would\nsay a hundred is overkill.\nSo it's less than a\nhundred in my view.\nI've been giving a number,\nand I'll keep giving it.\nI have zero weight in\nWashington or Moscow,\nbut that's what I think."], "3860": [22, 120, "So should we try to\nabolish nuclear weapons?\nReally is it a good idea?\nAnd so the answer is,\nthere's no risk-free world.\nWhat you have to\ndo, when you look\nat the arguments\nagainst abolition,\nand I've done my best to\nlook at what I consider\nthe serious ones,\npapers typically\ncriticize going to zero\nbecause it's risky.\nBut the question\nis what they never\ndo is talk about\nthe relative risks.\nIn other words,\nminimizing risks.\nHow do you minimize the risk?\nYou're never going\nto eliminate risks.\nIt's impossible.\nSo the right question is\nnot to eliminate risks,\nyou have to ask\nthe right question.\nEvery scientist knows that.\nThe right question here\nis minimization of risk.\nThat's the right question.\nHow do you minimize risk?\nDo you stay on\nthe present course\nor do you try to do\nsomething more creative?\nAnd this is one of\nthe creative things.\nAnd so the other thing is\nthat abolition in by itself\nis an important goal.\nAnd if we want the\nNPT to be healthy,\nwe better be serious about it.\nAnd those are the fireworks\nthat I'm talking about.\nAnd the nuclear weapons\nstates had better\ntake this into account.\nIf you want to look\nlong-range, how patient\nare the NPT states going to be?\nIt's very important."], "3980": [23, 160, "So, yeah, Obama\nhas a mixed record.\nHe's inspired great hopes.\nHe's done the new START Treaty.\nHe's improved nuclear security.\nHe tried to engage\nRussia for of the steps.\nActually, that's a dated slide.\nThose efforts and now dead.\nThe Russians effectively\nsaid no, by the way.\nSo this is bigger than Obama.\nYou know, Putin can veto\nnegotiations

it should.\nAnd in this day and age\nof budgetary restraints,\nit should be criticized.\nAnd in terms of\nstrategic stability,\nit should be criticized.\nSo there are two buzz words.\nOne is \"modernization,\" and\nthe other is \"maintenance.\"\nSo if you have\nnuclear weapons, you\nhave to maintain that\nthey're usable and safe--\nthat's maintenance--\nwithout testing.\nThat's important.\nAnd the other is to\nmodernize the weapons,\nmake them more\naccurate, and so forth.\nAnd that really\nshould not be done.\nAnd the two get fused\ntogether, and it's very hard\nto tell the

organizations.\nI'm on the board of the\nCouncil for a Liveable World.\nThe Arms Control Association\nis a wonderful organization\nin terms of giving\nout information.\nAnd their journal\nis quite

nuclear weapons."], "4310": [27, 710, "You can look at it.\nI'm sure this is only a partial\nlist of all that can be done.\nSome of it can't be done\nwithout Russia, but some can.\nFor example, we could\nreduce, more rapidly,\nto the level that Russia has\nof launchers and the new START\nTreaty.\nRussia, for example,\njust as an example,\nRussia is below the limits\nimposed by the START Treaty.\nThose limits go\ninto effect when?\nIn something like six or\neight years or something?\nI forget.\nDo you remember?\nWhen they go into effect?\nBut we could accelerate\nthose numbers.\nYou know, like typical\narms control treaties\nthey go into effect almost\nthe day they expire.\nSo it's always too slow\nfor arms control people.\nYou know, it's always\nwelcome, but always too slow.\nBut you take what you can get.\nBut again, I want to\njust repeat one thing.\nThe new START Treaty, the\nbig success of the new START\nTreaty, in my\nview, which was not\nstressed by the newspapers\nor the commentators,\nis the fact that the\ninspections are going on.\nAnd the inspections, in my\nview, are much more critical\nthan the numbers.\nThere's such overkill whether\nit's 1,000 or 1,500 weapons.\nI mean, again, this\n100 number is overkill.\nSo to me, it's almost\nirrelevant except symbolically\nwhether you have a\nthousand or 1,500.\nBelow a thousand,\nyou get into issues\nwith how many does China\nhave, and so forth.\nI showed you.\nSo a thousand is roughly\nthe critical point\nin which all the\nnuclear weapons states\nhave to negotiate\nwith each other,\nnot just the US and Russia.\nOf course, Russia's\ncritical there.\nOK, I'm going to stop.\nAnd of course, there's\nbeen a lot of questions,\nbut I'm happy for more\ndiscussion or whatever.\nYeah?\nAUDIENCE: You argued that\nit's typical to abolish\nall the nuclear weapons because\nit is used as deterrence.\nIf it's true, isn't\nthere another way\nof deterrence that would\nreplace the nuclear weapons?\nWhat is your opinion?\nPROFESSOR: Well, first of\nall, we already have it,\nand it's conventional\nsmart warfare.\nI haven't talked about it.\nThe United States\ncalls it Global Strike,\nwhich we're developing.\nAnd that's a whole\nother dimension.\nIt's not the nuclear arms\nrace, but it was too much\nfor me to get into that.\nBut, yes, you're asking\na very good question.\nAnd our conventional military\npowers are incredible.\nAnd we can do now,\nin many respects,\nwith conventional\nweapons what we\ncould have done only with\nnuclear weapons 20 years ago.\nOr even 10 years ago.\nAnd this Global\nStrike, which is a way\nto strike across the\nworld with precision,\nwith conventional weapons, with\nmissiles, with cruise missiles,\nand so forth, is incredible.\nAnd it's all sophisticated\ncommand and control\nstuff plus guidance.\nYeah?\nAUDIENCE: So in your\nopinion that could\nreplace the nuclear\n[INAUDIBLE] in the future?\nPROFESSOR: Well,\nreplace it in the sense\nthat you don't have\nnuclear weapons.\nBut then other people are\njust as scared as before.\nSo it's also an aggressive\nmilitary posture.\nAnd maybe, in the day\nand age when we're really\ntrying to replace that,\nthen we can no longer\ndistinguish between conventional\narms control and nuclear arms\ncontrol.\nThey will become\nmerged, I think,\nas an intellectual subject as\nwell as a practical matter.\nBut I'm looking ahead\nprobably at least 10 years.\nBut in my view,\nthat day will come.\nSo you're really asking\na great question.\nAUDIENCE: Disturbing.\nPROFESSOR: Yes.\nDisturbing.\nThe peace action will\nhave plenty of work\nto do for plenty of time.\nI'm afraid.\nWhat can I say?\nI'm not happy about\nthat, but it's a fact.\nAUDIENCE: I'm curious\nabout one thing.\nDo you know who in\nIndia or Pakistan\npresses that actual button?\nPROFESSOR: No, I do not.\nAUDIENCE: The reason I'm asking\nis is it delegated to some\n[? war-grade ?] people or some--\nPROFESSOR: OK.\nIn India-- look,\nhere's what I know.\nI don't know more\nthan I do know.\nWhat I think is true in India\nis that the armed forces\nare under civilian control.\nBut in Pakistan,\nthat is not true.\nSo Pakistan is not what you\nwould call a unitary state.\nOK There is no single\ncommand authority.\nI mean, there is\nofficially, but de facto\nwe know that the Pakistani\nmilitary is at least\nequal to the civilian branch.\nBut this ISI, whatever it\nis, the security thing,\nit seems to be\nquasi-independent.\nI'm not sure.\nSo you can see.\nBut what I'm afraid of\nis with this aggressive--\nI said it before,\nbut I'll just repeat\nit-- is this aggressive\nfirst strike military nucleus\nposture of Pakistan is leading\nto delegation of authority\nto low-levels where\nthere's a great danger\nof a rogue commander.\nSo I see Pakistan as\nthe place with the most\ndanger of a rogue commander.\nAnd I think I'm not the only\none who thinks this, by the way.\nAUDIENCE: Again,\nhow many weapons\ndo we think that Pakistan has?\nPROFESSOR: Roughly\nbetween 100 and 200.\nIt's more than 100 now.\nAUDIENCE: And they're\nmaking more all the time.\nPROFESSOR: They're\nmaking more all the time.\nThey're making them\nas fast as they can,\nas far as we can tell.\nAUDIENCE: The same\nin India, also?\nPROFESSOR: No.\nIndia seems to be\nmore relaxed about it.\nBoth in terms of their\naggressive policy--\nthey say they won't fire first.\nIndia has a much more\nreasonable stated policy of use.\nThey're much more laid back.\nThey say they won't\nuse them first.\nThey say the Pakistanis are\njust going much, much too far.\nBut on the Indian side,\nthe problem that I see\nis they're not trying for\nthe political solution.\nIn other words, their deployment\nposture is more sensible,\nbut they're focused on China.\nBut they are not-- India--\nmy big criticism of India\nis they are not\nsolving the problem.\nI'm going to come back to that.\nAUDIENCE: They're not\ninitiating any kind of--\nPROFESSOR: Right.\nThey're being much\ntoo slow in trying\nto heal problems like\nKashmir and other irritant\npoints in the relationship.\nI mean, they're not going\nto disappear overnight,\nbut they could do things.\nAnd I can point to\nsome literature,\nbut I'm not a real\nexpert, by the way.\nThe United States is\nnot being evenhanded,\nand that's a mistake.\nThat's a basic American mistake.\nSo, you know, I've been\ncritical since the beginning.\nI'm not the only\none on this basis.\nI think the predictable\nis happening.\nThey're just spurring Pakistan\ninto a more frenzied state\nof nuclear weapons development.\nIt's unfortunate.\nBut we're doing something\nwe don't want to see happen.\nWe deplore it on one hand,\nand then we encourage it\nindirectly on the other.\nSo it's a contradictory policy.\nIt's unfortunate.\nThey should know better,\nbut there they're\nletting commercial\ninterests override this.\nThis is a tug of war.\nThe United States\nsays many interests.\nAUDIENCE: Are you saying\nthe commercial interest\nwith respect to\npower plant sales?\nPROFESSOR: Right.\nAUDIENCE: It's sort of\ninteresting in that this\ngot started what?\nIn 2005 or 06?\nPROFESSOR: Under Bush somehow.\nAUDIENCE: Yeah.\nPROFESSOR: Right.\nAUDIENCE: And in the\nmeantime, of course,\nall the American\ncompanies are now\nowned by Japanese\nor French companies.\nSo what we're doing--\nPROFESSOR: Well, we also\nmake military hardware sales\nto India, which is increasing.\nThat was-- oh, that was one of\nthe other things from the Obama\nvisit, the sale of conventional\nmilitary equipment to India\nis going up for the first\ntime in a long time.\nSo that was a big\nsuccess, I guess.\nAUDIENCE: So that was a\npart of the recent trip?\nPROFESSOR: Yes.\nYes.\nI forgot to mention that.\nYou reminded me.\nThank you.\nThank you for coming."]}
