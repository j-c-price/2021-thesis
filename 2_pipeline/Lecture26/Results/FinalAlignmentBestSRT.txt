a hell of a\ntime constructing\na nice clean narrative arc to\neverything I wanted to say.\nAnd so I finally just\ndecided, the hell with it.\nI'm just going to be honest.\nThere's several\ndifferent pieces.\nThey don't make a narrative arc.\nThat's life.\nI want to address what I see\nas a sort of macroscopic view\nof the organization\nof the human brain\nis giving us a kind\nof picture of what\nI'm going to call\nthe architecture\nof human intelligence.\nWe're trying to understand\nintelligence in this class.\nAnd so I think the overall\norganization of the human\nbrain-- in which we've made a\nlot of progress in the last 20\nyears--\ngives us a kind of\nmacro picture of what\nthe pieces of the system are.\nSo I'll talk about that.\nAnd then I'll also--\nif I talk fast enough--\ndo a kind of whirlwind\nintroduction through the basic\nmethods of human cognitive\nneuroscience using face\nrecognition as an example\nto illustrate what each\nof the methods\ncan and cannot do.\nSo that's the agenda.\nIt's going to be pretty basic.\nSo if you've heard\nme speak before,\nyou've probably\nheard a lot of this.\nAnyway, the key\nquestion we're trying\nto address in this course\nis, how does the brain"], "90": [1, 60, "And how may we be\nable to replicate that\nintelligence in machines?\nSo there's, of course,\na million different ways\nto go at that question.\nAnd you can go at it from a\nkind of computational angle,\na coding perspective, from a\nfine-grained neural circuit\nperspective.\nBut I'm going to do something\nthat's kind of in between.\nbecause those are the things we\ncan approach in human brains.\nAnd it's really\nhuman intelligence\nwe want to understand.\nIt's a sum of human\nintelligences.\nA lot of it are things\nthat we share with animals,\nbut some of it is not.\nAnd so I think it's important\nto be able to approach this\nnot just from the perspectives\nof animal research, magnificent\nas those methods are,\nbut to also see what we\ncan learn about human brains.\nOK.\nSo I'll talk a bit about the\noverall functional architecture\nof the human brain.\nWhat are the basic\npieces of the system?\nAnd then I'll get into\nsome different methods"], "150": [2, 60, "OK.\nSo at the most general level,\nwe can ask whether human\nintelligence-- as people have\nbeen asking for centuries,\nactually--\nwhether human intelligence\nis the product\nof a bunch of very special\npurpose components,\neach optimized to solve\na specific problem,\nkind of like this\ndevice here, where\nyou have a saw for cutting wood,\nscissors for cutting paper.\nSaws don't work\nthat well on paper,\nand scissors don't\nwork that well on wood.\nOr whether human intelligence\nis a product of some more\ngeneric, all-purpose\ncomputational power\nthat makes us generically\nsmart without optimizing us\nfor any particular task.\nAnd just to\nforeshadow the answer,\nas in all questions in\npsychology, the answer is both.\nBut we'll do that\nin some detail.\nBefore we get into\nthat, who cares?\nAnd I'd say, first of all,\nthis kind of macro level\nquestion about functional\ncomponents of the human mind"], "210": [3, 100, "First of all, I just think it's\none of the most basic questions\nwe can ask about ourselves--\nabout who we are--\nis to ask what the basic\npieces are of our minds.\nSecond, more pragmatically,\nthis kind of divide and conquer\nresearch strategy has\nbeen effective in lots\nof different fields\nthat are trying\nto understand a complex system.\nWhat do you do with this\nincredibly complex system,\nwhere you just can't even\nfigure out how to get started?\nWell, one sensible\nway to get started\nis first figure out what\nits pieces are and then\nmaybe try to figure out how\neach of the pieces work.\nAnd then maybe some day,\nmaybe not in my lifetime,\nfigure out how they\nall work together\nin some coordinated fashion.\nAnd third, somewhat more\nsubtly, of course, we\nwant to know not just\nwhat the pieces are,\nbut what the computations\nthat are performed in each\nof those pieces and what the\nrepresentations extracted\nin each piece are.\nAnd I think even just a\nfunctional characterization\nof the scope of a\nparticular brain region\nalready gives us\nsome important clues\nabout the kinds of\ncomputations that go on there.\nSo if we find that there's\na part of the brain that's\nprimarily involved\nin face recognition,\nnot in reading visually\npresented words,\nrecognizing scenes, or\nrecognizing objects,\nthat already gives us\nsome clues about the kinds\nof computations that would\nbe appropriate for that scope\nof task.\nSo if you tried to write\nthe code to do that,\nyou'd be writing very\ndifferent code if it only\nhad to do face recognition\nversus if it also\nhad to be able to\nrecognize words and scenes\nand objects presented visually.\nOK.\nSo that's my list\nof the main reasons."], "310": [4, 180, "to investigate this\nquestion, and I'll\nmention some of those\nin the second half.\nBut I want to start\nwith Spearman,\nwho published a paper\nin 1904 in the American\nJournal of Psychology.\nThis article was sandwiched\nbetween a discussion\nof the soul and an\narticle on the psychology\nof the English sparrow.\nAnd in this article, Spearman\ndid the following low tech\nbut fascinating thing.\nHe tested a whole bunch of\nkids in two different schools\non a wide variety\nof different tasks.\nAnd this included scholastic\nachievement type things.\nHe got exam grades\nfrom each student\nin a bunch of different classes.\nAnd he measured a whole\nbunch of other kinds\nof psychological\nabilities, including\nsome very psychophysical\nperceptual discrimination\nabilities.\nHow well could\npeople discriminate\nthe loudness of two\ndifferent tones,\nthe brightness of two\ndifferent flashes of light,\nthe weight of two\ndifferent pieces of stuff?\nAnd what he found-- well,\nbefore I tell you what he found,\nwhat would you expect with this?\nShould we expect a correlation\nbetween your ability\nto discriminate two\ndifferent loudnesses\nand, say, your math score in\ngrade five on a math exam?\nSpearman's main result is\nthat most pairs of tasks\nwere correlated with each other.\nThat is, if you\nwere good at one,\nyou're good at the others--\neven tasks that\nseemingly had very little\nto do with each other.\nAnd this is the basis\nof the whole idea\nof g, which is the\ngeneral factor, which\nis what led to the whole\nidea of IQ and IQ testing.\nAnd in America, we're very\nuptight about the idea of IQ.\nBrits don't seem to have\na problem with this idea.\nThey're very enthusiastic about\nthe idea and always have been.\nBut aside from all the social\nuses and misuses of IQ tests,\nthe point is there's actually a\ndeep discovery about psychology\nthat Spearman made from the\nfact that all of these tasks\nwere correlated with each other.\nHe didn't know what it was, kind\nof like Gregor Mendel inferring\ngenes without knowing anything\nabout molecular biology.\nSpearman just inferred\nthere's something general\nabout the human\nintellect such that there\nare these strong\ncorrelations across tasks.\nOK, so that's g.\nBut less well known\nabout Spearman's work\nis he also talked about\nthe specific factor, s.\nAnd s was the fact that\nalthough the broad result\nof his experiments was that most\npairs of tasks were correlated,\nthere were some tasks that\nweren't so strongly correlated\nwith others, and that you could\nfactor those out and discover\nsome mental abilities that\nweren't just broadly shared\nacross subjects.\nAnd I think this kind of\nforeshadows everything\nthat we see with functional MRI.\nThere's a lot of specific\ns's, and there's also some g.\nAnd you can see those in\ndifferent brain regions,\nas I will detail next.\nAnother method was invented\nby Franz Joseph Gall."], "490": [5, 40, "live in different parts of\nthe brain, which I think\nis more or less\nright, as I'll argue.\nBut Gall lived in the 1700s, and\nhe didn't have an MRI machine.\nSo he did the best he\ncould, which wasn't so hot.\nHe invented the infamous\nmethod of phrenology.\nHe felt the bumps on\nthe skull and tried\nto relate those to\nspecific abilities\nof different individuals,\nand from this,\ninferred 27 mental faculties.\nMy favorites are and\namativeness, filial piety,\nand veneration.\nAnd so there's a kernel\nof the right idea,\nbut kind of the wrong method."], "530": [6, 160, "was the method of\nstudying the loss\nof specific mental abilities\nafter brain damage.\nAnd so Flourens,\nwho's often credited\nas being the first\nexperimental neuroscientist,\nwent around making lesions\nin pigeons and rabbits\nand then tested them\non various things.\nAnd he didn't really\nfind much difference\nin what parts of the\nbrain he took out\nfor their mental abilities.\nMaybe that's because he wasn't\nsuch a hot experimental--\nhe didn't have great\nexperimental methods.\nIn any case, he argued that\nall sensory and volitional\nfaculties exist in the\ncerebral hemispheres\nand must be regarded as\noccupying concurrently\nthe same seat in\nthose structures.\nIn other words, everything\nis on top of everything else\nin the brain.\nSo that was a sort of\ndominant view for a while.\nPeople thought Gall\nwas kind of a crackpot,\neven though he wrote\nvery popular books\nand went around Europe\ngiving popular lectures\nthat huge numbers\nof people attended.\nThe respectable\nintellectual society\ndidn't take him seriously.\nIn fact, the whole idea of\nlocalization of function\nwasn't taken seriously\nuntil Paul Broca,\na member of the French\nAcademy, stood up\nin front of the Society of\nAnthropology in Paris in 1861\nand announced that the\nleft frontal lobe is\nthe seat of speech.\nAnd this was based\non his patient\nTan, whose brain is shown here.\nTan was named Tan\nbecause that was\nall he could say after damage to\nhis left inferior frontal lobe.\nAnd Broca pointed\nout that Tan had\nlots of other mental\nfaculties preserved,\nand it was simply speech\nthat was disrupted.\nAnd from this was one of\nthe first respectable people\nto argue for\nlocalization of function.\nOK.\nSo this research\nprogram goes on.\nAnd by the end of\nthe 20th century,\nthere's pretty much agreement\nthat basic sensory and motor\nfunctions do\nexhibit localization\nof function in the brain.\nThere are different regions\nfor basic visual processing,\nauditory processing,\nand so forth.\nAnd that was no\nlonger controversial.\nBut the whole question\nof whether higher level\nmental functions were localized\nand distinct parts of the brain\nwas controversial then and\nremains controversial now.\nAnd so the method I'll\nfocus on is functional MRI,\nbecause I think it's played\na huge role in addressing\nthis question at this\nmacroscopic level.\nAnd I think you guys know\nwhat an MRI machine is."], "690": [7, 90, "the important part\nis its measure\nis a very indirect measure\nof neural activity by way\nof a long causal chain.\nNeurons fire, you incur\nmetabolic cost, and blood flow\nchanges to that region.\nBlood flow increase more than\ncompensates for oxygen use,\nproducing a local\ndecrease rather than\nthe expected increase\nin deoxyhemoglobin\nrelative to oxyhemoglobin.\nThose two are\nmagnetically different.\nThat's what the MRI\nmachine detects.\nIt's very indirect,\nso it's remarkable it\nworks as well as it does.\nAnd it's currently the\nbest noninvasive method\nwe have in humans in terms\nof spatial resolution, not\ntemporal resolution.\nOK.\nSo many of you are already\ndiving into the details of some\nof the data we collected.\nBut in case you're\non other projects\nand are coming\nfrom other fields,\nthe basic format of the data in\na typical functional MRI study\nis you have tens of thousands\nof three dimensional pixels\nor voxels that you scan.\nAnd typically, you\nsample the whole set\nonce every two seconds or so.\nYou can push it and do\nit every second or less\nunder special circumstances.\nYou can have more voxels by\nsampling at higher resolution,\nbut that's a ballpark of the\nformat of the kind of movie"], "780": [8, 60, "OK.\nSo a few things about the\nmethod and its limitations,\nbecause they're really important\nin terms of what you can learn\nfrom functional MRI\nand what you can't.\nSo first of all,\nthis is a timeline.\nMy x-axis, even though it's\ninvisible, is time in seconds.\nAnd so if you imagine looking at\nV1 and presenting a brief, say,\ntenth of a second high contrast\nflash of a checkerboard, what\nwe know from neurophysiology\nis that neurons fire\nwithin 100 milliseconds\nof a visual onset.\nThe information gets right\nup there really fast.\nThe BOLD, which stands for\nBlood Oxygenation Level\nDependent, or\nfunctional MRI response,\nis way lagged behind this.\nSo the neurons are firing\nway over here in this graph,\nessentially at time zero--\na tenth of a second.\nBut the MRI response is\nsix seconds later, OK?\nSo it's really slow."], "840": [9, 280, "and cannot learn from it.\nSo first of all,\nbecause it's so slow,\nwe can't resolve the steps in\na computation for fast systems\nlike vision and hearing and\nlanguage understanding--\nsystems for which we have\ndedicated machinery that's\nhighly efficient where you can\nrecognize the gist of a scene\nwithin a quarter\nof a second of one\nit flashes on a screen\nin front of you.\nAnd similarly, you understand\nthe meaning of a sentence\nso rapidly that\nyou've already parsed\nmuch of the sentence well\nbefore the sentence is over.\nSo these are extremely efficient\nrapid mental processes.\nThat means the component steps\nin those mental processes\nhappen over a few\ntens of milliseconds.\nAnd we're way off in temporal\nresolution with functional MRI.\nAll of those things are squashed\ntogether on top of each other.\nThat's a drag.\nThat's just life.\nWe can't see those\nindividual components steps\nwith functional MRI.\nThe second thing is that\nthe spatial resolution\nis the best that we have in\nhumans noninvasively right now,\nbut it's absolutely\nawful compared\nto what you can do in animals.\nSo I missed Jim\nDiCarlo's talk yesterday,\nbut those methods\nare spectacular.\nYou can record from\nindividual neurons,\nrecord their precise\nactivity with beautiful time\ninformation.\nIn contrast, functional\nMRI is like the dark ages.\nWe have, typically,\nhundreds of thousands\nof neurons in each voxel.\nSo the real miracle\nof functional MRI\nis that we ever see anything at\nall rather than just garbage,\nbecause you're summing over\nso many neurons at once.\nAnd it's just a lucky\nfact of the organization\nof the human brain that\nyou have clusterings\nof neurons with similar\nresponsal activities\nand similar functions\nat such a macro grain\nthat you can see some\nstuff with functional MRI,\nalthough you miss a lot as well.\nThe third important limit of\nfunctional MRI that comes out\nof just a consideration of\nwhat the method measures\nis that you can only really see\ndifferences between conditions\nwith functional MRI.\nThe magnitude of the MRI\nresponse in a voxel at a time\npoint is meaningless.\nIt might be 563, and\nthat's all it means.\nNothing, right?\nIt means nothing.\nIt's just the intensity\nof the MRI signal.\nThe only way to make\nit mean something\nis to compare it\nto something else--\nusually two different tasks\nor two different stimuli.\nAnd so you can go far\nwith that, but it's\nimportant to realize you\ncan't train translate it\ninto any kind of absolute\nmeasure of neural activity.\nIt's only a relative\nmeasure of strength\nof neural activity between two\nor more different conditions.\nOK.\nAnd the final deep\nlimitation of functional MRI\nis that we use this convenient\nphrase \"neural activity.\"\nIt's very convenient,\nbecause it's extremely vague.\nAnd fittingly so,\nbecause we don't\nknow exactly what kind\nof neural activity\nis driving the BOLD response.\nIt could be spikes\nor action potentials.\nIt could be synaptic activity\nthat doesn't lead to spikes.\nIt could be tonic inhibition.\nIt could be all kinds\nof different things.\nAnything that's\nmetabolically expensive\nis likely to increase\nthe blood flow response.\nIn practice, when people\nhave looked at it,\nit's very nicely correlated\nwith firing rate--\nwith some bumps and caveats, so\nyou can never be totally sure.\nBut it's a pretty good\nproxy for firing rate.\nYou just need to remember\nin the back of your mind\nthat it could be\nother stuff too.\nThe final, very important\ncaveat is that functional MRI--\nlike most other methods\nwhere you're just\nrecording neural activity in\na variety of different ways--\nyou're just watching.\nYou're not intervening.\nAnd that means you're not\nmeasuring the causal role\nof the things you measure.\nAnd that's very\nimportant, because it\ncould be that everything\nyou measure is just\ncompletely epiphenomenal and\nhas absolutely nothing to do\nwith behavior.\nSo in practice, that's\nunlikely that you\nhave all this systematic\nstuff for no reason,\nbut you need to keep in mind\nthat functional MRI affords\nno window at all into the causal\nrole of different regions.\nFor that, you need to complement\nit with other methods.\nSo despite all\nthese limitations,\nI think functional MRI has had\na huge impact on the field.\nAnd admittedly,\nI'm biased, but I\nthink it's one of\nthese things where\nas it happens, we get so\nused to a result the minute\nit gets published.\nIt was like, oh, yeah, right.\nOne of these, one\nof those, so what?\nBut I think it's\nimportant to step back,"], "1120": [10, 180, "why I think this is important.\nOK.\nHere is Penfield's functional\nmap of the human brain,\npublished in 1957, a\nyear before I was born.\nAnd he has six--\ncount them, six-- functional\nregions labeled in there.\nYou probably can't see them.\nBut it's the basic sensory and\nmotor regions, visual cortex,\nauditory cortex, motor cortex,\nspeech appear in Broca's area,\nand then my favorite is this\nword that says interpretive.\nNice.\nOK.\nAnyway, this was based\non electrical recording\nand stimulation in\npatients with epilepsy who\nwere undergoing brain surgery.\nActually a very powerful method,\nbut that's where it got him.\nHe published this near\nthe end of his career.\nAnd that's nice, but\nit's pretty rudimentary.\nOK, now, cut to\n1990, immediately\nbefore the advent\nof functional MRI.\nAnd this is really\ncrude-- the black outlines\nare the basic sensory\nand motor regions.\nAnd I've added a couple\nof big colored blobs\nfor regions that had been\nidentified by studying patients\nwith brain damage.\nSo even from Broca\nand Wernicke, it\nwas known that approximately\nthese regions were involved\nin language, because\npeople with damage\nthere lost their\nlanguage abilities.\nYou get whacked in\nyour parietal lobe,\nyou have weird\nattentional problems,\nlike neglecting the left half\nof space and stuff like that.\nIf you have damage\nsomewhere to the back end\nof the right\nhemisphere, you might\nlose face recognition ability.\nThese things were known by\naround 1990, not much else.\nThat's basically the functional\nmap of the brain in 1990.\nThat probably seems like\nancient history to a lot of you,\nbut not to me.\nOK.\nHere we are today.\nThere's a lot of stuff\nwe've learned, right?\nThere a lot of particular\nparts of the human brain\nwhose function has been\ncharacterized quite precisely.\nNot in the sense that we know\nthe precise circuits in there\nor that we can very\nprecisely characterize\nthe representations\nor computations,\nbut to the sense that we know\nthat a region may be very\nselectively involved,\nfor example,\nin thinking about what\nother people are thinking.\nA totally remarkable\nresult that Rebecca Saxe\nwho discovered it will tell\nyou about when she's here\nnext week.\nSo that was completely\nunknown even 15 years ago,\nlet alone back in 1990.\nAnd likewise, most of\nthese other regions\nwere either known in\nthe blurriest sense\nor not with this precision.\nSo I think even though\nthis is very limited,\nand it's kind of\nstep zero in trying\nto understand the human brain,\nI think it's important progress.\nAnd I think to push\na little farther,\nI'd like to see this\nas an admittedly very\nblurry but still a picture\nof the architecture\nof human intelligence.\nWhat are the basic pieces?\nWhat is it we have in here\nto work with when we think?\nWe have these basic pieces--\na bunch more that haven't been\ndiscovered yet, and a lot more\nthat we need to know\nabout each of these\nand how they interact\nand all of that,"], "1300": [11, 60, "So that's my story here for fun.\nThis is me with a bunch of\nfunctional regions identified\nin my brain.\nAnd so the argument\nI'm making here\nis that the human mind\nand brain contains\na set of highly\nspecialized components,\neach solving a different\nspecific problem,\nand that each of these regions\nis present in essentially\nevery normal person.\nIt's just part of the basic\narchitecture of the human mind\nand brain.\nNow, this view is pretty simple.\nBut nonetheless,\nit's often confused\nwith a whole bunch\nof other things\nthat people think\nare the same thing\nand that aren't, so it's\nstarting to drive me insane.\nSo I'm going to\ntake five minutes\nand go through the things\nthis does not mean.\nAnd I hope this doesn't\ninsult your intelligence,\nbut it's amazing how in the\ncurrent literature in the field\npeople conflate these things.\nSo I'm talking about\nfunctional specificity, which"], "1360": [12, 240, "is engaged in pretty\nselectively in just\nthat particular\nmental process and not\nlots of other mental process.\nThat's what I mean by\nfunctional specificity.\nThat's a different idea\nthan anatomical specificity.\nAnatomical specificity\nwould say it is only\nthis region that's involved,\nand nothing else is involved.\nThat's a different question.\nHow specific is this region\nversus are there other regions\nthat do something similar?\nAlso an interesting question,\nbut a different one.\nI'm going to go\nthrough this fast.\nSo if any of it doesn't make\nsense, just raise your hand\nand I'll explain it more.\nYet another idea\nis the necessity\nof a brain region for\na particular function.\nThat's actually\nwhat we really want\nto know with the functional\nspecificity question-- is not\njust does it only\nturn on when you do x,\nbut do you absolutely\nneed it for x?\nAnd so that's actually\na central question\nthat's closely connected.\nIt's really part of\nfunctional specificities.\nIt's the causal question.\nIt's different from the\nquestion of sufficiency.\nIs a given brain\nregion sufficient\nfor a mental process?\nWell, I think that's just kind\nof a wrong headed question,\nbecause nothing's\never sufficient.\nIt's just kind of\na confused idea.\nWhat would that mean?\nThat would mean we excise my\nface area, we put it in a dish,\nkeep all the neurons alive.\nLet's pretend we can do that.\nI'm sure Ed Boyden\ncould figure out\nhow to do that in a weekend.\nAnd so we have this\nthing alive in a dish,\ncan it do face recognition?\nWell, of course not.\nYou got to get the information\nin there in the right format.\nAnd if information\ndoesn't get out and inform\nthe rest of a brain, it doesn't\nhouse a face percept, right?\nSo you need things\nto be connected up,\nand you need lots of other\nbrain regions to be involved.\nSo let's distinguish\nwhether this brain region is\nfunctionally specific for\na process from whether it's\nsufficient for\nthe whole process.\nOf course it's not sufficient.\nAll right.\nI know you guys would\nnever say anything so dumb.\nOK.\nA question of connectivity--\nso people often say,\noh, well, this region\nis part of a network, period.\nAnd my reaction is, duh.\nOf course it's\npart of a network.\nEverything's part of a network.\nIn no way does that\nengage with the question\nof whether that region\nis functionally specific.\nA functionally specific region\nof course is part of a network.\nIt talks to other brain regions.\nThose other brain regions\nmay play an important role\nin its processing, sure.\nAt the very least, they're\nnecessary for getting\nthe information in\nand out and using it.\nOK?\nOK.\nAll right.\nThe final thing that\npeople confuse it\nwith functional\nspecificity is innateness.\nThis is a very\ndifferent concept.\nJust because we have\nsome particular part\nof the brain for which we\nmake it really strong evidence\nthat it's very specifically\ninvolved in mental process x,\nthat's cool.\nThat's important.\nThat's completely orthogonal\nto how it got wired up\nand whether it's innately\nspecified in the genome\nthat whole circuit--\nor whether that\ncircuit is instructed\nby experience over\ndevelopment, or as\nin the usual case, very\ncomplicated combinations\nof those two.\nSo just to remind you that\nfunctional specificity\nis a different question\nfrom innateness.\nAnd one way you can\nsee that very clearly\nis to consider the case\nof the visual word form\narea, about which I'll show\nyou some data in a moment.\nThe visual word form\narea responds selectively\nto words and letter strings\nin an orthography you know,\nnot an orthography\nyou don't know.\nIt's very anatomically\nstereotyped.\nMine is approximately\nright there,\nand so is yours in your brain.\nAnd it responds to\northographies you know.\nIf you can read\nArabic and Hebrew,\nyours also responds\nwhen you look\nat words in Arabic and Hebrew.\nIf you can't, it doesn't, or\nit responds a whole lot less.\nSo that's a function of your\nindividual experience, not\nyour ancestor's experience.\nIt has strong\nfunctional specificity,"], "1600": [13, 120, "So this idea that\nI'm staking out here\nhas become kind of unpopular.\nIt's very trendy\nto say, of course\nwe know the brain doesn't\nhave specialized components.\nSo for example, here's\nfrom a textbook.\nScott Huettel-- unlike\nthe phrenologists\nwho believe this very stupid\nidea that very complex traits\nare associated with\ndiscrete brain regions,\nmodern researchers recognize\nthat a single brain\nregion may participate in\nmore than one function.\nWell, he built in the hedge\nword \"may,\" so we can't really\nhave a fight.\nBut he's trying to stake\nout this different view .\nLisa Feldman Barrett--\nI haven't met her,\nbut she's driving me\ninsane, most recently\nby proclaiming all kinds of\nthings in The New York Times\njust a few weeks ago.\nQuote, \"in general, the\nworkings of the brain\nare not one to one,\nwhereby a given\nregion has a distinct\npsychological purpose.\"\nWell, she's got hedge\nwords \"in general.\"\nWe all have hedge words.\nBut basically, what\nshe's reasoning from\nis the fact that her data\nsuggests that specific emotions\ndon't inhabit specific\nbrain regions from the idea\nthat the whole brain has no\nlocalization of function.\nWell, that's idiotic.\nIt's just idiotic, right?\nSo I hope that people will stop\nthese fast and lose arguments.\nBut here's my favorite--\nthis old coot Uttal.\nI know this is going\nto be on the web,\nand here I am carrying on as\nif we are-- anyway, whatever.\nThis guy cracks me up.\nHe's been publishing.\nEvery year, he\npublishes another book\ngoing after functional MRI.\nAny studies using\nbrain images that\nreport single areas of\nactivation exclusively\nassociated with a\nparticular cognitive process\nshould be a priori considered\nto be artifacts of the arbitrary\nthreshold set by\nthe investigators\nand seriously questioned.\nYou go.\nSo anyway, that's fun.\nAnyway, my point is just that\nwe should engage in the data,\nright?\nThis isn't like an\nideology, where we can just\nproclaim our opinions.\nThere are data that speak to it."], "1720": [14, 260, "OK.\nSo what would be evidence\nof functional specificity?\nThere are lots of\nways of doing it.\nThe way I like to do it is\nsomething called a functional\nregion of interest method.\nThe problem is\nthat although there\nare very systematic regularities\nin the functional organization\nof the brain, each of these\nregions that I'm talking about\nis in approximately\nthe same location\nin each normal subject.\nTheir actual location varies\na bit from subject to subject.\nSo if you do the standard\nthing of aligning brains\nand averaging across them,\nyou get a lot of mush,\nand yet there isn't much mush\nin each subject individually.\nAnd so to deal\nwith that problem--\nand to deal with a bunch\nof other problems--\nwe use something\ncalled a functional\nregion of interest method.\nAnd that means if you want\nto study a given region,\nyou find it in that\nsubject individually.\nAnd then once you've found it\nwith a simple contrast-- you\nwant to find a face\nregion, you find a region\nthat responds more when\npeople look at faces\nthan when they look at objects.\nNow you found it\nin that subject.\nIt's these 85 voxels right\nthere in that subject.\nNow we run a new experiment to\ntest more interesting questions\nabout it, and we measure the\nresponse in those voxels.\nOK?\nThat also has the advantage that\nthe data you plot and look at\nis independent of the way\nyou found those voxels--\na very important problem\nin a lot of functional\nneuroimaging, where people have\nnon-independent statistical\nproblems with their\ndata analysis.\nIf you have a functional region\nof interest that's localized\nindependently of the\ndata you look at in it,\nyou get out of that problem.\nIt's also a huge\nbenefit, because one\nof the central problems with\nfunctional brain imaging,\nwhich I think has\nled to the fact\nthat a large percent of the\npublished neuroimaging findings\nare probably noise,\nis that there are just\ntoo many degrees of freedom.\nYou have tens of\nthousands of voxels.\nYou have loads of different\nplaces to look and ways\nto analyze your data.\nOne of the things I love\ndearly about the functional\nregion of interest method\nis that you tie your hands\nin a really good way, right?\nSo you specify in\nadvance exactly where\nyou're going to look, and you\nspecify exactly how you're\ngoing to quantify the response.\nAnd so you have no\ndegrees of freedom,\nand that gives you a huge\nstatistical advantage.\nAnd it means you're less likely\nto be inadvertently publishing\npapers on noise.\nOK.\nSo that's the functional\nregion of interest method.\nWe've done loads of\nthese experiments.\nHere's just from a current\nexperiment in my lab\nbeing conducted\nby Zeynep Saygin.\nShe's actually looking at\nconnectivity of different brain\nregions using a different\nmethod I probably\nwon't have time to talk about.\nIt's very cool.\nBut in the process,\nshe's run a whole bunch\nof functional localizers.\nAnd so we can look in her data\nat the response of the fusiform\nface area to a whole bunch\nof different conditions.\nSo these are a bunch of\nauditory language conditions,\nso, OK, not too surprising.\nIt doesn't respond\nvery much to those.\nThey're presented\nauditorily, but these are all\nvisual stimuli here.\nThe two yellow bars are faces.\nThis is line drawings of faces.\nThis is color video\nclips of faces--\nstrong responses to both.\nAnd all of these\nother conditions--\nline drawings of objects, movies\nof objects, movies of scenes,\nscrambled objects, words,\nscrambled words, bodies--\nall produce much\nlower responses.\nOK?\nSo I would say this is\npretty strong selectivity.\nIt's been tested against\nlots of alternatives,\nonly a tiny percent of\nwhich are shown here.\nAs I mentioned before, it's\npresent in more or less\nthe same place and pretty\nmuch every normal subject.\nI think it's just a basic\npiece of mental architecture.\nNow, this is a very\nsimple univariate measure.\nWe're just measuring\nthe very crude thing\nof the overall magnitude\nof MRI response\nin that region to\nthese conditions.\nThere are legitimate\ncounter-arguments\nto the simple-minded\nview I'm putting forth,\nand we should consider them.\nI think the most\nimportant one comes\nfrom pattern analysis methods,\nwhich I will talk about\nif I get there.\nAnd importantly, these\ndata don't tell us\nabout the causal\nrole of that region.\nWe'll return to those.\nHowever, the point\nis, before we blithely\nsay it's not fashionable to talk\nabout functional specificity,\nwe need counterarguments\nto data like this.\nThey're pretty strong.\nAnd that's just one example,\nto show you just a few others\nfrom Zeynep's paper.\nOK, so this is what\nI just showed you,"], "1980": [15, 170, "We can look at\nother brain regions.\nOK.\nSo this is a bottom\nsurface of the brain\nthere, so this is the occipital\npole, front of the head, bottom\nof the temporal lobe.\nThat face area is the region\nin yellow in this subject.\nThis purple region is\nthat visual word form area\nthat I mentioned, and here\nis its response magnitude\nacross a whole\nbunch of subjects,\nlocalizing and then\nindependently testing.\nThe purple bars are when\nsubjects are looking\nat visually presented words.\nAnd again, all these\nother conditions--\nfaces, objects, bodies,\nscenes, listening to words,\nall of those things--\nmuch lower response.\nIn the same experiment, we can\nalso look at a set of regions\nthat respond to speech.\nI mentioned those very\nbriefly in my introduction\na few days ago.\nThese are regions a number\nof people have found.\nIn this case, they're\nimmediately below\nor lateral to primary\nauditory cortex in humans,\ninterestingly situated right\nbetween primary auditory cortex\nand language sensitive regions.\nRight between is the set\nof regions that respond\nto the sounds of speech--\nnot to the content of language,\nbut the sounds of speech.\nAnd so this is when people\nare saying stuff like,\n\"ba da ga ba da ga.\"\nSo they're just\nlying in the scanner,\nsaying, \"ba da ga ba da ga.\"\nAnd here's when they're\ntapping their fingers\nin a systematic order.\nHere's when they're\nlistening to sentences.\nImportantly, this\nis when they're\nlistening to\njabberwocky gobbledygook\nthat's meaningless.\nSo no meaning, but phonemes--\nsame response.\nThat's what tells us that\nthis region is involved\nin processing the\nsounds of speech,\nnot the content of language,\nand load everything else.\nSo other things-- moving\noutside of perceptual regions,\nyou might say, OK, fine.\nPerception is an\ninherently modular process.\nThere's different kinds\nof perceptual problems,\nthat make sense.\nBut high level cognition--\nwe wouldn't really\nhave functional\nspecificity for that.\nBut oh, yes, we do.\nHere are some language regions.\nThere's a bunch of them in\nthe temporal and frontal lobe\nthat have been known\nsince Wernicke and Broca.\nBut now, with functional\nMRI, we can identify them\nin individual subjects and\ngo back and repeatedly query\nthem and say, are\nthey involved in all\nof these other mental processes?\nSo this is now the response\nin a language region--\nso identified, here's\nthe response when\nyou're listening to sentences.\nThis is when you're listening\nto jabberwocky nonsense strings.\nHere's when you're saying\n\"ba da ga ba da ga.\"\nIt's not just speech sounds.\nHere's when you're listening to\nsynthetically decomposed speech\nsounds that are\nacoustically very\nsimilar to the\njabberwocky speech.\nIt's just not interested\nin those things.\nIt seems to be\ninterested in something\nmore like the meaning\nof a sentence."], "2150": [16, 290, "this is data from Ev Fedorenko,\nwho has tested this region.\nNow, this is sort of\nroughly Broca's area,\nthe main mental functions\nthat people have argued\noverlap in the\nbrain with language.\nNamely-- sorry, this is\nprobably hard to see here,\nbut arithmetic, so we\nhave difficult and easy\nmental arithmetic.\nIntact and scrambled\nmusic in pink.\nA bunch of working\nmemory tasks--\nspatial working memory and\nverbal working memory--\nand a bunch of cognitive\ncontrol tasks--\njust kind of an\nattention demanding task\nwhere you have to switch between\ntasks and stuff like that.\nAnd here is the response\nprofile in that region.\nReading sentences,\nreading non-word strings.\nAll of those other\ntasks, both the difficult\nand the easy version--\nno response at all.\nThat's extreme functional\nspecificity, right?\nIt's not that we've\ntested everything,\nthere's more to be done.\nBut the first pass querying\nof do those language regions\nengage in all of these other\nthings that people thought\nmight overlap with language?\nThe answer is no, they don't.\nAnd I think that's really\ndeep and interesting,\nbecause it means that this\nbasic question that we all\nstart asking ourselves\nwhen we're young\nis, what is the relationship\nbetween language and thought?\nI know Liz disagrees\nwith me somewhat on this.\nThat's because she's\nvery articulate,\nand she doesn't feel the\ndifference between an idea\nand its articulation.\nI'm less articulate.\nIt's very obvious to me\nthey're different things.\nNo, it's not the only reason.\nShe has data, too, and\nit'd be fun to discuss.\nBut I think there's a\nvast gulf between the two\nin that many different\naspects of cognition\ncan proceed just fine\nwithout language regions.\nAnd actually, the\nstronger evidence for that\ncomes not from these\nfunctional MRI data,\nstriking as I think they\nare, but from patient data.\nSo Rosemary Varley in England\nhas been testing patients\nwith global aphasia.\nThis is this very\ntragic, horrible thing\nthat happens in patients who\nhave massive left hemisphere\nstrokes that pretty\nmuch take out\nessentially all of their\nlanguage abilities.\nThose people she has shown\nare intact in their navigation\nabilities, their arithmetic\nabilities, their ability\nto solve logic\nproblems, their ability\nto think about what other\npeople are thinking,\ntheir ability to appreciate\nmusic, and so on and so forth.\nSo I think there's really\na very big difference\nbetween a major\npart of the system\nthat you need to understand\nthe meaning of a sentence\nand all of those other\naspects of thought.\nThis is just showing\nyou what I mean\nby functional specificity--\nwhat the basic first\norder evidence is.\nAnd these are just\nthe regions that we\nhappen to have in this study\nso I could make a new slide.\nBut for lots of other perceptual\nand cognitive functions,\npeople have found quite\nspecific brain regions\nfor perceiving bodies and\nscenes, of course, motion.\nThe area MT has been\nstudied for a long time--\nregions that are\nquite specifically\ninvolved in processing shape.\nWe've been studying color\nprocessing regions recently.\nThey're not as\nselective for color\nas some of these other\nregions, but they're\nvery anatomically consistent.\nAnd things I mentioned before in\nmy brief introduction-- regions\nthat are specifically involved\nin processing pitch information\nand music information,\nand as you'll\nhear next week from\nRebecca Saxe, theory\nof mind or thinking about\nother people's thoughts.\nAnd so there's quite a\nlitany of mental functions\nthat have brain regions that\nare quite specifically engaged\nto that mental function.\nAnd each of these--\nto varying degrees, but to\nsome appreciable degree--\nhave corroborating\nevidence from patients\nwho have that specific deficit.\nSo that shows that\neach of these is\nlikely to be not only\nactivated during,\nbut causally involved\nin its mental function.\nAnd as I mentioned, there are\nactually good counter-arguments\nto some of the things\nI've been making\nthat are worth discussing.\nI think the pattern analysis\ndata is the strongest.\nOh, and I do need to\ntake a few more minutes.\nJust like five or something?\nOK.\nSo all of that's\nto say, so here's\nroughly where we are now.\nThere are counter-arguments, but\nloose talk about, oh, there's\nno localization of\nfunction in the brain.\nYou got to engage\nwith us at first\nand give me a serious\ncounter-argument.\nOK.\nFinally, I want to say that\nit's not that the whole brain is\nlike this, right?\nThere are big gray patches\nwhere we haven't figured\nout what it's doing, but there\nare also substantial patches\nthat have already\nbeen shown to be,\nin some sense, the\nopposite of this."], "2440": [17, 330, "you do at all.\nAnd I think this is a\nvery interesting part\nof the whole story of the\narchitecture of intelligence,\nso I'm going to take five\nminutes and tell you about it.\nThis work is primarily the\nwork of John Duncan in England.\nAnd he's been pointing\nout for about 15 years\nthat there are regions in the\nparietal and frontal lobe shown\nhere that are engaged in pretty\nmuch any difficult task you do.\nAny time you increase the\ndifficulty of a task--\nwhether it's perceptual\nor high level cognitive--\nthose regions turn\non differentially.\nAnd so that's why he calls\nthem multiple demand.\nThey respond to multiple\ndifferent kinds of demand.\nDuncan argues that\nthese regions are\nrelated to fluid intelligence.\nSo remember Spearman,\nwho I started with,\nwho talks about the\ngeneral factor, g.\nWell, Duncan thinks\nthat basically, this\nis the seat of g--\nthese regions here-- to\noversimplify his argument.\nThere's multiple sources\nof evidence for that.\nAnd one is, well,\nthey're strongly\nactivated when you do\nclassic g-loading tasks.\nThat's not that surprising.\nThey're activated in all\ndifferent kinds of tasks.\nMore interestingly, he\ndid a large patient study,\nwhere they found 80 or\nso neuropsych patients\nin their patient database.\nAnd they identified the\nlocus of the brain damage\nin each of those patients.\nAnd what they did was they\nmeasured post-injury IQ.\nThey estimated from a variety\nof sources pre-injury IQ.\nAnd they asked, how much\ndoes your IQ go down\nafter brain damage\nas a function of one,\nthe volume of tissue you\nlost in the brain damage,\nand two, the locus of tissue?\nAnd basically, what\nhe finds is if you\nlose tissue in these\nregions, your IQ goes down.\nIf you lose tissue\nelsewhere, you\nmay become paralyzed or\naphasic or prosopagnosia.\nYour IQ does not go down.\nIn fact, he made a kind\nof ghoulish calculation\nthat you lose 6 and 1/2\nIQ points for every 10\ncubic centimeters of\nthis region of cortex,\nand almost nothing for\nthe rest of the brain.\nSo this is kind of crude.\nIt's very imperfect what you\ncan get from patient study,\nbut I think it's intriguing.\nAnd so his suggestion is that\nin addition to these highly\nspecialized cortical\nregions that we\nuse for these particular\nimportant tasks,\nwe also have this kind of\ngeneral purpose machinery that\nmakes us generically smart.\nAnd I'm going to skip around.\nWe've tested this\nmore seriously.\nHe did group analyses,\nwhich I don't like.\nWe did it in\ncollaboration with him\nwith individual\nsubject analyses,\nthe most precise measurements\nwe could make, and boy,\nis he right.\nI mean, even to\nthe voxel you can\nfind that these\nregions are engaged\nin seven or eight very,\nvery different kinds\nof cognitive demand--\nall activate the same\nvoxel differentially.\nSo the basic story I'm\nputting forth here--\nwithout the second half of my\ntalk, I'm sorry about that--\nis that at a macro\nscale, the architecture\nof human intelligence is that\nwe have these special purpose\nbits for a smallish number of\nimportant mental functions,\nnot all of them innate--\nmaybe some of them.\nIn addition, we have some\ngeneral purpose machinery.\nThere's loads more\nthat we don't know\nfrom the precise computations\nthat go on in these things,\nto their connectivity, to the\nactual precise representations\nthat you can see with the neural\ncode if you could measure it,\nwhich we can't in\nhumans, to the timing\nof these complex interactions,\nwhich of them are uniquely\nhuman, which of them are\nalso present in monkeys.\nAnd I don't have time\nto go find the slide,\nbut one of the things\nwe've been doing recently\nis looking in the\nventral visual pathway\nat the organization of face,\nplace, and color selectivity.\nAnd what we see is that--\nwe is me and Bevil Conway\nand Rosa Lafer-Sousa.\nBevil and Rosa had\npreviously shown\nthat on the lateral\nsurface in the monkey,\nyou have three bands\nof selectivity.\nSo it goes face selectivity,\ncolor selectivity,\nplace selectivity,\nand three bands\non the side of the\ntemporal lobe in monkeys.\nWe find this in humans.\nYou have exactly the same\norganization in the same order,\nbut it's rolled around on the\nventral surface of the brain\nin the same order--\nface, color, place-- on\nthe bottom of the brain.\nSo we think that whole\nbroad region is homologous\nbetween monkeys and humans.\nIt just rolled\naround on the bottom.\nMaybe it got pushed over\n[AUDIO OUT] something.\nAnd that's not exactly\na novel argument.\nActually, Winrich wrote a paper\nsuggesting this a while back,\nand I think we're starting\nto see those homologies.\nAnd the reason\nthat's important is\nthat it means that all these\nquestions we desperately\nwant to answer about the\ncausal role, connectivity,\npopulation codes, [AUDIO OUT]\ninteractions between regions,\ndevelopment-- all\nof that that we\ncan't answer very\nwell in humans,\nWinrich can answer in monkeys.\nAnd after a break, he will\ntell you about all of that.\n[APPLAUSE]"]}
