ENDELEMENTSignal propagation in dendrites and axons

+ Relatively few inputs to a neuron are
made onto the soma.

+ Inputs arrive onto the dendtites ~
which are thin branching processes
that radiate from the soma.

+ Many synapses form onto the
dendrite at some distance from the
soma (as much as 1-2 mm away)
