ENDELEMENTSignal propagation in dendrites and axons

* So far we have considered a very
simple model of neurons - a model
representing the soma of the neuron.

¢ We did this because in most
vertebrate neurons, the region that
initiates action potentials is at the
soma.

* This is usually where the ‘decision’ is
made in a neuron whether to spike or
not.

ENDELEMENTSignal propagation in dendrites and axons

* Relatively few inputs to a neuron are
made onto the soma.

* Inputs arrive onto the dendrites —
which are thin branching processes
that radiate from the soma.

* Many synapses form onto the
dendrite at some distance from the
soma (as much as 1-2 mm away)

at the soma (and elsewhere in the dendrite)?

A scales as Vradius

Neurons need to send signals over a distance of a ~100 mm in
the human brain.

What would a (radius) would have to be to get A= 100 mm?
a=20 mm!

This would never work! This is why signals that must be
sent over long distances in the brain are sent by
propagating axon potentials.

ENDELEMENTExtra Slides on Input impedance

How much voltage does it take to produce a given current into our
dendrite? (How much pressure does it take to get a certain water
flow?)

Obviously, a big hose has less resistance to

flow. le. it takes less pressure

A small hose has more resistance and takes
more pressure

 

This is called the ‘input impedance’ of the
cable
