ENDELEMENTRole of Sleep in Memory

+ Sleep allows examination of memory
independent of behavior.

+ The formation of lasting memories may
involve the communication of
information between brain areas during
sleep

+ Broadly identify two stages of non-REM
sleep -(NREM) and rapid eye
movement sleep (REM).

and primary and secondary visual cortex
during spatial behavior.

+ Look for reactivation in both structures
during sleep

ENDELEMENTHippocampal activity during quiet
wakefulness

+ During awake behavior, there are
periods of quiet wakefulness that have

EEG that is similar to NREM consisting
of brief bursts of activity modulated by
high frequency “ripple” oscillations.

+ Is there structure to the patterns of
multiple single neuron activity during
this state?
