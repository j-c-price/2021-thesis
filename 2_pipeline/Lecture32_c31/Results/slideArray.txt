ENDELEMENTThe lameilar hypothesis revisited

 

Fig. 2. The position of the hippocampal formation in the rat brain is shown in this drawing of a

preparation in which the cortical surface overlying the hippocampus has been removed. The hippocampus
is an elongated. C-shaped structure with the long or septotemporal axis running from the septal nucle:
rostrally (S) to the temporal cortex (T) ventrocaudally. The short or transverse axis (TRANS) is onented
perpendicular to the septotemporal axis. The major fields of the hippocampal formation (except for the
entorhinal cortex) are found in slices taken approximately midway along the septotemporal axis. The shce
poctured at top Heft is a representation of the summary of the major neuronal elements and intrinsic
connections of the hippocampal formation as onginally illustrated by Andersen et al. (see text for details)

ENDELEMENTHippocampus in spatial and
episodic memory

The hippocampus is involved in the
formation of episodic memory as well as
spatial memory used in navigation.

Navigation - linkage of spatial locations
Episodic memory - linkage of events

Both may depend critically on temporal
sequence encoding

Sleep allows examination of memory
independent of behavior.

The formation of lasting memories may
involve the communication of
information between brain areas during
sleep.

sleep -(NREM) and rapid eye
movement sleep (REM).

ENDELEMENTOverall summary

* Sequence memory can be encoded in the
hippocampus during active behavior.

* Sequence memory is subsequently replayed
during sleep in both the hippocampus and
neocortex.

¢ The content of reactivated memory during sleep
can be biased by external manipulation.

¢ Sequence memory replayed during quiet
wakefulness is associated reward information and
may serve a different role in learning than replay
during sleep.
