about\nthis as two modes, online mode\nand offline mode.\nIn the online mode, you're\ntaking information in."], "30": [1, 110, "and evaluating information.\nWhat's the purpose of\nevaluating information\nthat you've taken in?\nWell, if we think about\nthe general problem that's\nbeing solved, the\nproblem of intelligence.\nThe problem of intelligence is\ntrying to understand and infer\nthese sort of deep generalizable\nrelationships rules.\nYou're trying to extract\nrules from instances.\nAnd you'd like those\nrules to be as generally\napplicable as possible.\nAnd in order to do\nthat, presumably, one\nhas to go back and evaluate\nthe many individual instances\nto try to extract some kind\nof statistical regularity,\nand then perhaps evaluate\nmodels that you have constructed\nin terms of their consistency\nwith individual instances\nthat you've already collected.\nOr perhaps future instances\nthat you haven't yet.\nSo you have the raw material,\nyou build a little model,\nand then you continually\ntest that model\nagainst new information\nthat comes in.\nAnd the question is,\nwhen can you do that?\nNow, you could do\nthat when you're\nout and about in the world.\nAs you saw and read in that\npaper, when animals are sitting\nquietly, they very\nquickly can switch\ninto this kind of offline mode\nthat looks a lot like sleep.\nIn fact, electrophysiologically,\nsleep and quiet wakefulness\nin the hippocampus are\nnearly indistinguishable.\nIt's the same kind\nof offline mode.\nIt says, OK, when the\nhippocampus is not\nbeing used to take\nnew information in,\nI quickly switch into this\noffline evaluation mode.\nBut during sleep, I no\nlonger have the constraint\nof having to direct behavior.\nBehavior's shut off,\ninputs are shut off,\nand now I can switch into this\npurely internal introspective\nmode.\nSo what goes on during sleep.\nIn this simple experiment,\nwe look at the activity\nwhen the animal is\nperforming behavioral tasks."], "140": [2, 20, "both before and after,\nand ask, is there\nanything about\nbehavioral experience\nthat changes activity\nduring sleep?\nAnd what we found was that\nif you look at activity\nduring behavior\nin which you think\nabout these spatial\nsequences being expressed,"], "160": [3, 50, "you find that the spatial\nsequences are expressed again.\nSo the hippocampus replays the\nfiring of these cell sequences.\nBut it replays the firing\nof these cell sequences\nat a time scale that appears\nto be compressed relative\nto the behavioral timescale.\nSo these are eight place cells.\nAnimals were walking\nfrom left to right.\nThe ticks indicate that's\nthe location of the peak.\nSo these place cells will\nfire one through eight\nas the animal moves along the\ntrack over about five seconds.\nThat's how long it\ntakes the animal\nto walk from left to right.\nThe same sequence of\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\ngets replayed during\nsleep, but now\nover about 150 milliseconds.\nSame sequence, so you're\npreserving time order,\nnot absolute time."], "210": [4, 20, "what's going on in the\nlocal field potential\nin these oscillations?\nAnd this is where you find\nthese sharp wave ripple events.\nThis is this ripple-like event\nthat I was describing to you.\nSo these sharp wave\nripples are when\nthese apparently compressed\nsequences are being expressed."], "230": [5, 200, "ripple reactivated sequences\nis the same model that I like\nto use to explain\nphase precession\nduring the fade oscillation.\nThat is, I give it an\ninput, I sweep inhibition\nfrom high to low such that cells\nthat are getting the strongest\ninput fire earlier.\nAnd this will\nreactivate a sequence.\nSo the difference\nbetween a theta sequence\nand a reactivated\nsequence is really just,\nwhere's the input coming from.\nIf the input's coming from what\nI'm actually experiencing right\nnow, now it's a theta sequence.\nAnd as I move, the input\nchanges systematically.\nAnd so, again, it looks like\nit's encoding information\nabout space.\nIf I'm now offline,\nand this information\nis being delivered\nto the hippocampus\nfrom some other\nsource, you can apply\nexactly the same operation,\nget the same kind of sequence.\nIt's just now it's\non information\nthat is not tied to your\nimmediate context or location.\nThat's the only difference.\nWhere is the input coming from?\nNow further, if you\nthink about this model,\nyou can imagine the\ndepth of disinhibition\ncould actually affect the\nlength of the sequence.\nBut that's just sort\nof a mechanistic thing.\nAnd if you actually look\nat the mechanisms that\nregulate sharp wave ripples\nin the theta oscillation,\nit basically comes from\nthe same structure.\nIt's a structure that\nregulates acetylcholine,\nand it's a neuromodulator\nthat's associated\nwith attention and\nmemory, and the structure\ncalled the medial septum.\nSo the medial septum\nprovides the drive,\nthe cholinergic drive,\nof the hippocampus.\nDamage to the medial septum,\nloss of cholinergic tone,\nwas one of the dominant models\nof neurodegenerative cognitive\nand memory loss in\nAlzheimer's disease.\nSo what you find is\none of the earliest\nindications of neurodegenerative\ndamage in Alzheimer's is\nthe loss of cholinergic tone.\nAnd the systems that\nbegin to break down\nare the systems that\nactually fall along\nthis limbic pathway starting\nwith hippocampus-entorhinal\ncortex.\nSo it's as though the\ncholinergic system that\nregulates the expression of this\noscillation in the hippocampus,\nwhen it breaks down, it\nleads to general memory\nloss and disruption.\nAnd it turns out the\nmedial septum is also\ninvolved in regulating the\nexpression of these sharp wave\nripples.\nSo, same system,\ndifferent modes.\nOne quite active, online.\nOne inactive, offline.\nSame kind of modulation\nof excitability\nthrough inhibition.\nBut that's the idea.\nSimple model, sweep inhibition,\nthat gives you the sequences.\nAnd then if you can\ncontrol the input,\nyou control the input\nto control the content,\nyou control the\ninhibition to control\nthe structure of the timing.\nThose are the two things.\nSo the question is, how\ncould you control the input?\nWell, you're kind of\nthinking about what\nis the input into\nthe hippocampus"], "430": [6, 20, "And as I mentioned,\nhippocampus, you've\ngot the entorhinal cortex.\nEntorhinal cortex gets\ninformation across the brain.\nIt's sort of these\nsensory association areas,\nvisual cortex, auditory cortex.\nSo all this information\nabout the world\nconverging on the hippocampus\nand then getting modulated.\nAnd so let's look in, for\ninstance, the visual cortex."], "450": [7, 10, "and the hippocampus, we could\nsee how these two structures\ncommunicate.\nAnd when we do this\nin a simple task--\nthis is like a little\nfigure eight task--"], "460": [8, 110, "But one interesting\nthing that came out\nfrom doing this\nexperiment, recording\nthe visual cortex\nand the hippocampus,\nis that recording in the visual\ncortex when an animal is moving\nin space, what you find is\ncells in the visual cortex\nhave spatial-like\nreceptive fields.\nSimilar to the hippocampus,\nthough not as spatially tuned.\nBut here, for instance, are\neight visual cortical cells.\nAnd you can see that\nthey fire in a sequence.\nThey'll have different\nspatial receptive fields.\nThis shows where this one visual\ncortical cell likes to fire.\nDifferent visual\ncortical cells will\nfire at different locations.\nSo when animals are\nmoving in space,\nyou actually see\nsequential activation\nof these visual\ncortical responses.\nAnd so if you have visual\nperceptual sequences\nin hippocampal\nspatial sequences,\none question is, how\ndo those sequences\nrelate offline when the animal,\nfor instance, during sleep.\nSo you have sequences\nduring sleep\nin the hippocampus,\nsequences during sleep\nin the visual cortex.\nAnd it turns out that those two\nthings are actually correlated.\nSo when hippocampus plays\nout a spatial sequence,\nthe visual cortex plays\nout a visual sequence\nthat corresponds to the visual\nresponses at those locations.\nSo hippocampus\nplays out a sequence\nof where it was,\nvisual cortex expresses\nthe visual stimuli that were\npresent along that sequence.\nOne thing about\nthese sequences when\nwe're looking at hippocampal\nneocortical interactions\nis that the sequences are now\nat a much longer time scale.\nAnd in fact this\ntime scale, which\nhere is on the order of about\nhalf a second to a second,\ncorresponds to\nanother oscillation"], "570": [9, 100, "So when you go to\nsleep, brain rhythm,\nthe oscillations, the dominant\nfrequencies start to slow down.\nAnd you'll get this\noscillation in this one\nhertz or so frequency range.\nIf you record activity\nfrom a bunch of cells,\nit looks like this.\nThis is the activity\nof a whole bunch\nof cells in the visual\ncortex in the hippocampus.\nAnd you see that the activity is\nflipping between lots of cells\nactive, no cells active.\nThese are the\nso-called up and down\nstates of cells during sleep.\nThat every half a second to\na second or so many cells\nwill become active, then\nthey'll all be shut off,\nthen they'll become\nactive again.\nSo you are flipping between\nthese up and down-like states.\nAnd if you look at\nthese up and down states\nin the visual\ncortex, and you look\nat similar activity\nin the hippocampus,\nyou see these up and down-like\nstates in the hippocampus\nas well.\nBut you'll notice that the\nup state in the neocortex\nleads up state in\nthe hippocampus.\nSo neocortex first, then\nhippocampus, neocortex,\nhippocampus.\nNeocortex seems to lead.\nSo again, this question of,\nwho's providing the input?\nThat simple model where\nI'm sweeping inhibition\nduring the theta, during active\nbehavior, that information\nis coming in from perception,\nis what I'm saying.\nDuring sleep, the question\nis, where is that information\ncoming from?\nWell, this would say, this\nis where it's coming from.\nIt's coming from\nthese cortical areas.\nLet's say sensory, visual\ncortical areas turn on.\nThey provide the information\nto the hippocampus.\nNow the hippocampus turns\non, and the hippocampus\nresponding to input coming\nin from the sensory cortex."], "670": [10, 90, "manipulate hippocampal\nactivity by manipulating\nthe sensory cortex?\nAnd so this experiment, simple\nexperiment, answer was yes.\nIn this case we use\nthe auditory system.\nOne of the reasons to\nuse the auditory system\nis that, unlike\nthe visual system,\nthe auditory system remains in\na state of persistent vigilance,\neven during sleep.\nAuditory cortical\nresponses, even when\nthe animal goes\nto sleep, measure\nauditory cortical responses\nsame as when it's awake.\nSo essentially the\nauditory cortex\nstays vigilant\nduring sleep, which\nhas clear evolutionary value.\nAnimal's asleep, it's\ntrying to minimize arousal\nby shutting off visual input,\nwhich may be of limited value\nanyway, given the\ncircadian nocturnal nature\nof visual stimuli.\nSo if you can't see\nanything, you might as well\nactually close your eyes.\nBut you can still hear things.\nSo you and other\nanimals are still\nlistening to pick up\nthreats that might require\nthat they actually wake up.\nSo anyway, taking\nadvantage of that.\nAuditory system on, so\ntrain an animal on task\nwhere it learns to associate\nauditory cues with locations.\nRight sound means go\nover here to get food,\nleft sound means go\nover there to get food.\nVery simple task.\nThen animal goes to\nsleep, and you just\ncontinue to play the sounds.\nSo it's learned something.\nAnd now you try to bias cortical\nactivity during sleep and ask,\nwhat does that do?\nAnd so this is the idea."], "760": [11, 50, "we can decode\nhippocampal activity.\nSo we can tell, oh, here's\nthe hippocampal pattern that\ncorresponds to the left\nside or the right side.\nAnd in this case, when the\nanimal's performing the task,\nplay the right-hand\nsound, animal\ngoes to the right-hand\nside, see this\nin the hippocampal response.\nPlay the left-hand sound, animal\ngoes to the left-hand side.\nAgain, the left-hand\nplace fields\nwhen the animal's on the\nleft, right-hand place\nfields on the right.\nSo this is what the\nexperiment and the behavior\nlooks like from the\nstandpoint of the hippocampus.\nVery clear, right?\nRight sound, right\nhippocampus, right place cells.\nLeft sound, left place cells.\nBut now the animal's\ngoing to go to sleep,\nand we're going to\ndo the same thing.\nContinue to play the right\nsounds and the left sounds.\nIt's just that now the\nanimal is not actually\nmoving on the track.\nAnd so we ask,\ndoes that-- can we"], "810": [12, 50, "So there's the same thing now.\nAnimal's awake, but now\nit's going to go to sleep,\nand we just keep\nplaying the sounds.\nThe little tics there indicate\nthe delivery of sounds\nevery 10 seconds or so.\nSo we play a sound, and now\nwe look at the response.\nThe difference here is that\nthe animal's not running,\nit's not behaving.\nSound, response.\nNow we'll decode the activity.\nSo here, for instance, we take\na little short window here,\nabout half a second.\nAnd what you see is this\nis this up-like state.\nMulti-unit activity,\nlots of cells firing.\nDecode activity.\nNow ask when you\nplay the left sound,\nwhat does activity decode to?\nAnd here you see it's going to\ndecode into the left-hand side.\nSo that's the basic hypothesis.\nPlay the left sound,\nyou get the replay"], "860": [13, 20, "You play the right sound,\nyou get reactivation\nof the right side of the track.\nAnd that's what you get.\nSo when you play\nthe left-hand sound,\nleft sound bias activates\nplace cells on the left side."], "880": [14, 230, "And you can do the same kind\nof psychophysical experiments\nwhich has been done in humans,\neither with different sensor\nmodalities-- it's been\ndone in olfaction.\nIt's also been done in audition.\nSo the equivalent\nexperiment, using auditory\ncueing in humans, where you have\npeople learn the simple task.\nAnd this was done\nin Ken Paller's lab\nwhere they do the simple\nspatial matching game.\nIt's like, you know,\nwhere's the cat card,\nwhere's the teapot card?\nThe variant here is when they\nflipped over the cat card,\nthey would play the\ncat sound, a meow.\nWhen they flip over\nthe teapot sound,\nthey play a little associated\nauditory cue, teapot whistle.\nAnd then people go to sleep.\nAnd during sleep, they would\nplay either the cat sound\nor the teapot sound.\nAnd they found that\nwhen they would wake up\nand now they do the task,\nif they played the cat\nsound during sleep,\nthey were better\nat remembering the location\nof the cats than the whistle.\nSo this says not only does sleep\nactually contribute to memory,\nbut it's selective.\nAnd not only is it selective,\nbut it can be influenced.\nIt can be biased.\nYou can direct the\nnature memory processing.\nAnd then our experiments\nsuggest that, well,\none of the consequences of\nthis kind of sleep manipulation\nwould be to bias the\nmemory reactivation\nin the hippocampus.\nAnd so the idea is simple.\nThat is that cortex\nbiases the state\nthat the hippocampus gets.\nAnd then the hippocampus takes\nthat state, sweeps inhibition,\nreplays a sequence,\nand that sequence then\ngets played back to the cortex.\nSo the cortex, it\nsort of knows--\nit has these sort\nof discrete states\nthat doesn't necessarily know\nwhat the causal correlations\nmight be.\nWhat happens next?\nIt doesn't necessarily\nknow what happens next.\nIt knows what happened.\nHippocampus knows\nwhat happened next.\nIt has lots of instances\nof that though.\nWell, I saw a red light,\nwhat happens next?\nYou say, oh, you\nknow, I saw red light,\nand all the cars stopped.\nOK, that's great.\nIf I'm just the cortex,\nthat's what I learned.\nAll the car stop.\nIf I'm the hippocampus, I'm a\nlittle bit smarter than that.\nI say, you know, last Tuesday I\nwas there, there's a red light,\nand all the cars, except\nfor these cyclists.\nMan, they didn't stop,\nthey just kept on going.\nSo wait a minute,\nthere's a rule.\nRed light, cars stop,\nbicycles don't stop.\nSo you have to refine what\nappear to be simple rules.\nOften that's actually\nused in an example.\nHow do you use the\nprefrontal cortex?\nOh, red light means stop,\ngreen light means go.\nThat's great, except in the real\nworld, that rule is too simple.\nIt has to be refined based upon\nyour particular experience.\nIn fact, if you're\nreally sophisticated,\nred light means cars, except\nfor cabbies, will stop, right?\nIf I see a cabbie, guaranteed\nthat guy's not going to stop,\nhe's going to accelerate, right?\nAnd that's the kind of\ninformation-- that's\nwhat the hippocampus has.\nAnd so you imagine\nthat's what's going on.\nNeocortex, in each one of\nthese slow oscillations,\nis saying red light.\nAnd the hippocampus says,\noh, yeah, OK, cars stop.\nRed light again.\nWell, there was that bicycle\nthing, bicycles continue to go.\nRed light.\nWell, that was the\ncabbie incident.\nSo now you have all these\nsort of causal sequences\nthat are being expressed\nback to the neocortex,\npresumably in order to establish\nthis more comprehensive,\nconsolidated model of\nreal world traffic lights,\nrather than the\ncartoon traffic lights.\nAnd so that would be the idea\nof what's going on during sleep.\nNow, during quiet\nwakefulness you\ncan think of the\nsame sort of idea."], "1110": [15, 50, "multiple casual contingencies.\nEach of which might be\nexpressible as a simple rule,\nbut might also be experienced\nas distinct variations\nof that rule.\nAnd the idea is, OK,\ndo we use the rule,\nor do we use the exceptions,\nor how do we actually\nrefine the rule based upon\nthese different instances\nor exceptions?\nAnd so you can think about\nthat as refining the rule,\nthat's like the learning side.\nApplying the rule, that's the\nmemory or decision making side.\nSo you can think about,\nduring quiet wakefulness,\nthis reactivation being used in\nthe service of actual learning\nor in decision making."], "1160": [16, 10, "and one of the things that we\nhad discovered interestingly\nabout reactivation\nduring quiet wakefulness\nwas that when animals stop\nafter running on a track,"], "1170": [17, 40, "This is raw data, animal\nrunning from left to right\nand then stopping for\na long period of time.\nAnd you can see activity.\nThere are these\nbursts of activity.\nYou blow these things up, these\nare these sharp wave ripples.\nThey last about\nhalf a second or so.\nSo you see a burst\nof activity, you\nsee these place cell sequences.\nIn this case the\nsequence actually\nruns in time reversed fashion.\nSo in this case--\ntime reversed fashion-- this\ndoesn't seem like planning\nor decision making.\nIt may be evaluation of\ntemporal correlations\nthat might be relevant\nto behavior and learning.\nBut what would a\nreverse sequence"], "1210": [18, 190, "The insight into how\nthis might be used\ncame from computational models.\nIn fact, computational models\nthat the post-doc in this case,\nDave Foster, who\nmade this discovery,\nhad used in his doctoral work.\nWhere he was actually\nbuilding models,\nreinforcement learning\nmodels of spatial navigation.\nAnd one of the problems\nin reinforcement learning\nis that reinforcement\noften comes\nafter you've actually\ncarried out the steps that\nlead up to it.\nIn other words, you\nwalk from left to right,\nyou get rewarded\nwhen you get here.\nWhat you want to\nknow is not just,\nthis is where the reward is.\nWhat you really want\nto know is, what\nwere the things that\nactually lead up to that?\nIn other words, I want to\ntake credit, reward value,\nand I want to spread\nit backward in time\nto place value on the\nthings that predict\nor lead up to reward.\nThe so-called temporal\ncredit assignment problem.\nHow do I give credit to things\nthat actually lead up to\nor predict reward?\nAnd thinking about how you\nmight solve the temporal credit\nassignment problem, this\nreverse reactivation\nactually has the capacity to\nsolve that problem in one step.\nIf you imagine when the\nanimal gets to the end,\ngets some reward,\nand if now at that\npoint I pair the delivery\nof reward signal,\nwhich I will indicate here as--\nthis is a cartoon\nsuggesting this is dopamine,\na reward signal.\nAnd I'm going to pair that\nwith the reverse sequence.\nAnd now you can think\nof the association.\nThis is my current location.\nThis is way back\nwhere I started from.\nCurrent location gets\npaired with strong reward.\nRemote location gets\npaired with low reward.\nSo this association\nwill essentially solve,\nwill convolve this discrete\nreward impulse function,\nwill turn it into\nthis continuous graded\nmonotonic reward\ngradient function.\nTranslating this into this\nessentially in one step.\nSo the thinking is, hey,\nanimals are actually\nusing this to learn,\nand they're using\nthis to solve the\ntemporal credit assignment\nproblem in a way that\nwould be important for\ngeneral reinforcement learning.\nNow, I won't go into--\nso, we actually\ndid this experiment\nrecorded from the reward area,\nthe VTA, and the hippocampus.\nAnd, indeed, during these\nreactivation events,\nyou see the pairing of\nthis reward signaling.\nAnd not only do\nyou see the pairing\nof the reward\nsignaling, but you find\npairing of the reward\nsignaling in which\nthe precise firing\nof reward signals\nmap onto the delivery of\nrewards at goal locations.\nSo it's not just certain\nsequences are good,\nothers are bad.\nIt's that there are\ncertain locations\nalong the sequence that have\ndifferential reward value.\nSo there's a mapping of\nrelative reward to location."], "1400": [19, 50, "performing a task you can see\nbiases in these sequences that\ncorrespond to planning.\nSo both of these\nelements of sequence\nreactivation--

sequences,\nit turns out that\nreactivated sequences\ntend to be directed\ntoward the locations\nwhere the animal thinks\nthe goal might be.\nSo it's sort of\nthinking about things\nthat would lead to

further\nout in the future\nsimply takes more time.\nAnd so that suggests\nthat there's\nan interesting\nconstraint in capacity\nfor extended\nevaluation that comes\nin the form of these oscillatory\nmodes of the slow oscillation.\nLonger, or slower, frequencies\ngive you, essentially,\nmore time, longer sequences.\nAnd that, potentially, if\nyou want to go even longer,\nyou might actually\neven link sequences\nacross subsequent cycles.\nJust as you could do across\nsuccessive sharp wave ripples,\nyou might be able to do that\nacross successive slow waves.\nSo the idea that you have these\noscillations that you can link\nor couple sequences\nacross different cycles\nof these oscillations,\nthat you have oscillations\nat different\nfrequencies, suggests\nthat this is the mechanism.\nIt's the compositional\nmechanism for sequences that\nare nested within oscillations.\nBy combining these\noscillations you\ncan construct these sequences in\nways that presumably
