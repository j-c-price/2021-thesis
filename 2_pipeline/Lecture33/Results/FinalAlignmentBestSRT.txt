this course\nto learn about high level\ncognition machines that\ndo amazing things.\nSurely this guy's not\ngoing to talk about a fly.\nBut I am going to\ntalk about a fly.\nAnd I will try in the beginning\nto explain to you why.\nAnd hopefully, by\nthe end, we'll see.\nI won't declare victory at\nall, and you can tell me\nif it applies or whatever."], "50": [1, 120, "Flies are in all sorts\nof mushroom bodies.\nI'm going to talk about a\npart of the fly brain called\nthe mushroom body.\nAnd mushroom bodies are\nin all sorts of insects.\nAnd I kind of like this quote.\nWe more like to say the mushroom\nbody is the soul of the fly.\nBut what I want to point out\nhere is this part of the quote.\nFlies are not as\nintelligent as you,\nbut they're\nintelligence, much of it,\ncomes from this small part of\nthe brain called the mushroom\nbody.\nIf you have free will,\nthey have free will.\nBut unlike you, we can here\npoint to a part of the brain\nand say, that's where it is.\nAnd I'll try to convince\nyou of that as we go on.\nAnd so that's why I'm\ntalking about a fly.\nYou can really say there's this\nsmall part of the brain called\nthe mushroom body--\nI'll show it to\nyou in a second--\nwhere maybe not uniquely,\nbut certainly is\na point at which\nintelligent behavior arises,\nin which something like\nfree will, whatever\nmakes different flies\ndo different things\non different occasions arises.\nNow, not only that,\nagain, compared\nto what you might\nknow in a mammal,\nthis is a region of the\nbrain where all the cell\ntypes are known.\nThere's genetic control\nover all the cell types.\nThere is a very good\noptical level anatomy.\nAnd very soon, there'll\nbe an EM level anatomy.\nSo it's a region of the\nbrain that has all of that.\nAnd so I thought it would\nbe a good example of where\nthe limits of knowledge\nof neuroscience\nare really extended out.\nYou have to put up\nwith it's only a fly.\nSure, it's kind of\na stupid animal.\nBut I'll show you some behaviors\nand what this thing can do,\nand we'll see how it will go.\nAnd maybe just some\nmachine learning.\nSo these are the\npeople involved."], "170": [2, 40, "is not zero, but it's\nvery, very small.\nAnd so much of it is\ndone in collaboration\nwith Richard Axel and members\nof his lab, of whom all\nof these-- you\ncan see the names.\nAnn is a theory student\nwho worked with me.\nBut an awful lot of the\nwork is done at Janelia\nin a collaboration with\nJerry Rubin's group,\nand in particular, Yoshi Aso\ndid a huge amount of work here.\nSo I feel just fortunate to\nbe able to kind of correct\nthe commas on the paper.\nThat was my role\nin this project."], "210": [3, 90, "OK, so what is the\nmushroom body all about?\nThis is a diagram of\nthe olfactory system.\nI should have said\nat the beginning,\nnot only is it flies,\nit's olfaction.\nTwo of the most--\ncan you pick a more boring sense\nand a more boring creature?\nSo anyway, let's give it a try.\nSo flies have receptors\nalong their antenna.\nThe don't have a\nnose, but that's\nwhere the olfactory\nreceptors are.\nI'll show you in a schematic\na little bit later.\nThere are neurons that\nreceive the odors,\nthen send a signal\nto this structure.\nThis is called\nthe antennal lobe.\nAnd at that point,\nit gets relayed\nfrom these set of neurons\nto a set of neurons\ncalled projection neurons.\nThose go up here, and\nthey send their signal\nto the mushroom body.\nAnd the mushroom body is\nthis kind of L-shaped thing\nhere that I'll describe\nin more detail.\nAnd then they also send axons\nto another region of the brain\ncalled the lateral horn.\nI'll come back to that.\nI think I'll come back to that.\nMaybe I should say it\nnow so I don't forget.\nSo as you'll see,\nthe mushroom body\nis going to be responsible\nfor learned behaviors,\nis responsible for learned\nbehaviors in the fly.\nAnd the lateral\nhorn is responsible\nfor innate behaviors.\nYou'll see at the\nend of the talk,\nactually, evidence of that.\nSo there's a division which\nactually occurs in your brain\ntoo of the olfactory\npathway to an innate\npathway and a more\nflexible learned pathway."], "300": [4, 40, "So this is a diagram.\nThis is, again, from\nthe Janelia work\nof real pictures of the stuff.\nIt's overlaid on a fly brain.\nYou don't see the\nperiphery here,\nbut these are the\nantennal lobes.\nSo this is this relay\nstation in the fly brain.\nHere is one of the projection\nneurons you see here.\nThis is the mushroom body.\nAgain, this L-shaped thing.\nAnd then it goes backwards.\nSo that purple are the cell\nbodies of the mushroom body.\nAnd here you can see it, again,\ngoing to the lateral horn.\nThis is the optic part of the\nfly brain for doing olfaction.\nThis is obviously a\nschematic of the stages"], "340": [5, 190, "These are supposed\nto be the receptors,\nso let me start with them.\nThey're called olfactory\nreceptor neurons.\nThere are about 1,000 of them.\nThey come in around 50 types.\nAnd here the types have\nbeen drawn in colors.\nAnd what a type means\nis a cell that expresses\na single receptor molecule.\nSo it will bind to a\nset of odors, whatever\nthat particular molecule does.\nAnd so all of these\nred guys are virtually\nidentical in their responses.\nAll of the green guys\nare identical, et cetera.\nAnd there are 50 types.\nAnd I'll show you\nin a second, they\nform about a 30-dimensional\nrepresentation\nof olfactory space.\nNot as high as in your nose.\nNot nearly as high\nas in a mouse's nose.\nBut that's what you get.\nOK, as I mentioned,\nthese project\nto this structure, which\nis the antennal lobe\nin my little diagram.\nAnd they have the\nproperty that all\nof the cells of a certain\ntype, in other words expressing\na particular receptor, project\nto the same site, which\nis called a glomerulus.\nSo you can see all the red\nguys go to the red one.\nAll the purple guys to\nthe purple one, et cetera.\nSo this is an incredibly\nprecise wiring\ngetting these 50 olfactory\nsignals from the 50 types\nto a point in space,\nor a region in space.\nAnd that's the point at\nwhich the next cells--\nso this is obviously\nthe input layer.\nI'm sort of over here,\ngiving you computer language,\nif you want, for all this.\nSo at this point, you have\nthe projection neurons\npick up the signal.\nThere are about\n200 of them, again,\nin the exact same 50\ntypes, because there\nare a few projection\nneurons for each\nof these different glomeruli.\nAnd they send the signal\nonto the mushroom body,\nand as I mentioned,\nthe lateral horn,\nalthough we won't talk about\nthat whole lot until the end.\nAnd this is a\none-to-one connection.\nSo every projection neuron--\nlet's say there are\nred type projection\nneurons that just pick up the\nred signal, send it onward.\nThere are purple type\nguys-- they're not really\ncalled this-- but they accept\nthese 50 signals, maintain them\nas separate pathways.\nSo what's this thing doing\nfrom a sort of computer science\npoint of view?\nObviously, it's pooling.\nSo these 1,000 cells are\npooling their resources\ninto 50 glomeruli.\nSo you're averaging and\nyou're reducing noise.\nAnd there's also a normalization\nprocess that goes on here.\nThere are lateral\nconnections here\nthat try to even out\nthe responses so that--\nlet's say at a fixed\nconcentration, one odor that\ncauses a lot of responses\nin the receptors\nand another odor that gives\nmuch less response kind of get\nequaled out here, so that\nthe strong odor doesn't\noverwhelm the weaker odor.\nOK, so that's this stage."], "530": [6, 90, "So here are the 50.\nThis is not all data.\nThis is data plus extrapolation.\nBut the data comes\nfrom a beautiful study\nof Hallem and Carlson.\nThese would be the 50 ORNs,\ntypes, so one of each type.\nAnd here are 110 orders\nthat were tested.\nAnd the responses in firing rate\ncolor kind of look like this.\nYou can see they've\nbeen graded here.\nThe responses get stronger as\nyou move from left to right.\nThat's just the way\nthey ordered them.\nAnd you can see\nthey're quite uneven.\nSo here is a kind of\nweak responding odors\nand here are much\nstronger responding odors.\nSo that's what's coming in.\nNow, if you look at the PN\nlevel-- now, this is not data.\nThis is a model.\nIt's a model really due to\nRachel Wilson and members\nof her lab, but also\nconstructed by Sean Luo\nand Ann Kennedy in my group.\nAnd you can see the argument.\nSo basically, what's\nhappened is these inputs\ncome in and have gone through\na model that reproduces what\nwe think the PNs are doing.\nPNs have not been tested with\nthis whole panel of odors.\nBut you can see the\nnormalization effect.\nYou notice that the activity\nis spread much more equally\nacross these odors\nthan these odors.\nAnd that's reflected in the\nfact that if you measure\nby various ways the dimension\nof this representation,\nyou get about 30.\nAnd here it goes up\na little bit to 35\nbecause of this kind\nof equalization effect,\nand also some decorrelation\neffect that goes on."], "620": [7, 330, "So there is that.\nSo what I've described here\nis sort of the front end\nof this olfactory system.\nAnd it is completely\nstereotyped.\nIt's a precise wiring.\nI've described it to you.\nIt's the same in every fly.\nIf you look at two\nneurons of the same type,\nthey look virtually identical.\nSo this is a hard-wired system.\nAnd you would not say\nthere's any free will\nor intelligence in this system.\nIt's just getting the signal in.\nAnd you'll see a little\nbit more of that later.\nOK, so what about\nthe next level?\nThe next level is\nthe mushroom body.\nSo these yellow things are\nthe mushroom body neurons.\nThey're called Kenyon cells.\nThere are about 2,000 of them.\nThey come in only seven types.\nSo already, we sense\nsomething's happening here.\nThere's something changing\nabout the representation.\nThe representation is getting\nmuch higher dimensional.\nIt's something like\n1,000 dimensional.\nSo there's a projection\nout to a high dimensional\nrepresentation.\nAnd this is where the\nfree will comes in.\nAnd in anatomical terms, the\nreason it does is because--\nI'll try to persuade\nyou with the data--\nthat this acts exactly like\na random, high dimensional,\nhidden layer in a\nmachine learning system.\nSo this guy is\nsuddenly a new beast.\nWithin one synapse,\nthe system's gone\nfrom completely stereotyped\nto, you know, crazy.\nCompletely random.\nI would say there's\nlots of evidence\nthat it's different\nin every fly,\nthat every one of these\nneurons is different.\nAnd you've completely\ngiven up the stereotypy.\nSo now, how do you\nget back to sense?\nBecause you've built\nthis beautiful olfactory\nrepresentation here, and it's\nas if you've thrown it out.\nYou've just gone crazy.\nAnd so now, I put the box\naround here just to remind us,\nthis is a different\nbeast all of a sudden.\nAnd it's a very unusual\nbeast in the fly brain.\nI'll come back to that.\nBut now you have output.\nSo these yellow\nneurons, as you'll see,\ndo not leave the mushroom body.\nThey don't send any signal out.\nThey're completely intrinsic\nto the mushroom body.\nBut there are neurons called\nmushroom body output neurons\nthat do send the signal out.\nAnd again, now it's\na new ballgame.\nFirst of all, look\nat the numbers.\nYou've gone from 2,000 neurons\nto 34 neurons of 21 types.\nYou've got about a\n20-dimensional representation.\nThere's been a collapse\nof the representation.\nSo I would argue you can just\nsee right away from this slide\nthat this is an\nolfactory representation.\nThis is an olfactory\nrepresentation cleaned up\na bit.\nThis is a crazy, random\nolfactory representation.\nThis is not an olfactory\nrepresentation.\nThe dimension is lower\nthan what you started with,\nso there's no way you can\nrepresent the full thing.\nThis is already, somehow, making\na decision about olfaction.\nIt's well on the\nway to a behavior.\nAnd again, the great\nthing about the fly\nhere is that you get\nthere very quickly.\nIf you went to Jim's\ntalk today, I'm\nsure he talked to you\nabout the long pathway\nin the visual\nsystems of monkeys,\nin which these stages take up\na good fraction of your brain.\nThese more complicated\nstages do it.\nAnd then it's very\ndifficult to see\nwhere this transition is to\ndecisions and things like that.\nHere, the transition from\norderly input representation,\nsort of retinal-like,\nto IT-like,\nif you want, in the visual\nsystem occurs in one synapse.\nAnd then the return to\na decision, a behavior,\nin another synapse.\nIt's very quick.\nAnd I would think of that\nin computer science terms\nas a readout layer.\nAs you'll see, it's\nactually a layered system,\nbut it's the readout.\nOK, and this system\nhere, it goes back\nto being completely stereotyped.\nThere are very few neurons\nper type, if you notice.\nThere are almost as many cell\ntypes as there are neurons.\nAnd they're the same\nin every animal.\nSo you've gone from\nstereotypy at the input\nstage, a wild and crazy\nrandom thing in the middle,\nand then back to stereotypic\nto get to the output.\nWhich of course, you\nhave to do, right?\nYour motor neurons have to\ngo to the right muscles.\nYou can't randomly wire\nyour motor neurons.\nAnd thinking occurs\nbetween those.\nSame thing with your retina.\nIt has to be wired to give\nyou the basic visual signal.\nBut between those\ntwo extremes, that's\nwhere we do our thinking.\nAnd as I say, that\nyou can see here,\nbut it's in this one layer, OK?\nAll right, and the key is going\nto be exactly as in a machine\nlearning system.\nAs you'll see, the key\nto the whole system\nis the plasticity and\nmodulation that occurs\nat that set of connections.\nThere's no evidence that these\nconnections, these connections,\nand these connections are\nat least very plastic.\nThey may be modulated\na little bit,\nbut the business\nend of this thing,\njust as in many machine\nlearning networks,\nis that the readout\nunit's being adjusted.\nAnd I will come back to that.\nAll right, so here,\nthe mushroom body,"], "950": [8, 30, "And as it turns, you'll see why\nit's called the mushroom body.\nYeah, now it looks\nlike a mushroom.\nSo these are the cell bodies.\nThey receive-- you can't\nreally see very well here,\nbut they receive their input\nright under the mushroom.\nAnd then they send axons down.\nAnd these axons form the load.\nSo this whole thing is\nmade out of Kenyon cells.\nThat's the Kenyon cells\nall together forming\nthis structure.\nHow many cells?"], "980": [9, 80, "OK, now here you can see one\nof the projection neurons.\nHere's where it gets its\ninput from the antenna lobe,\ngoes up to the mushroom body,\ngoes over to the lateral horn.\nAnd here you can see-- it's\nsort of hard to distinguish\nthat neuropil from\nthe cell bodies here,\nbut here you can see that sort\nof under this layer of cell\nbodies, it's making\nits connections.\nAnd what I want to\nstress here is this idea\nthat the projection\nneurons occur\nvery few cells per cell type.\nNow, these cells types--\nI guess I'm going to get\nahead of myself a little bit.\nBut through work at\nJanelia Farm in particular,\nthere have been these\nintersectional strategies\nfor expressing various\nmarkers in these cells.\nAnd they've been\nsupremely successful.\nSo typically, when you get a\ncell type in this business,\nit's often two cells, one\non each side of the fly.\nThey're perfect mirror\nimages of each other.\nAnd they're identical\nin all flies.\nSo that's what you\nmean by a cell type.\nAnd in much of the fly, there\nare very few of them per--\nthis is per side.\nThere will always\nbe an even number.\nAnd you can see, there are 50\ntypes, a couple hundred cells.\nThat's part of the\nspecific wiring."], "1060": [10, 60, "there are, as I mentioned, about\na couple of thousand of them.\nAnd there are up to\n600 of them per type.\nIt's much more like what\nwe think of as cortex.\nWe don't think of the cortex\nas having millions and millions\nof cell types.\nMaybe thousands, but there are\nmany, many cells per cell type.\nAnd that occurs here.\nVery small number of cell types\nrelative to the other things.\nAnd here's one of them.\nIt's superimposed.\nSo these Kenyon cells, they\nhave their cell body here.\nThey make their connections.\nSo they get the input from\nthe projection neuron,\nsend an axon down, which\nin some cases splits.\nAnd there are five lobes here.\nThere is an alpha lobe\nor an alpha prime lobe\nhere, a beta lobe or a\nbeta prime lobe here.\nAnd then some of them\nsend a single axon\ndown to a gamma lobe.\nYou will see that\na little bit more.\nThen that's it.\nThat's how the mushroom body's\nbuilt. And if you notice,"], "1120": [11, 20, "So the first thing\nI want to ask, then,\nis what happens at this junction\nbetween the orderly world\nof the fly, characterized\nby these PNs,\nand the wild and random world\nof the fly, characterized\nby these Kenyon sets?\nHere's where they meet in this\ncalyx of the mushroom body."], "1140": [12, 150, "in the data analysis of\ncame from Richard's lab\nand was done in\nthe following way.\nFirst, a single Kenyon\ncell-- so here you\ncan see all these cell\nbodies of Kenyon cells.\nThere are zillions\nof them up there,\nthousands of them up there.\nBut one of them has been--\nthe GFP in one of them has\nbeen activated, photoactivated.\nSo you can see this single\nKenyon cell comes down.\nHere it's making connections\nto get the olfactory input\nfrom the projection neurons.\nAnd then the axon's\ngoing to go down\nthrough the floor into the\nother parts that I showed you.\nSo the trick in this thing--\nyou can't see very well,\nbut I think I maybe made\na circle around one.\nYou can't see it very\nwell, but the terminals\nof this guy, the postsynaptic\nterminals, are like claws.\nThey're called claws.\nAnd they grab hold of one of\nthe terminals of the projection\nneurons and make a synapse.\nSo that's how they work.\nThis guy has about\nseven of these claws,\nso there are very few\nconnections per Kenyon cell.\nThe trick was for Sophie\nto inject the die right\ninto the claw here, which\nis a very tightly sealed\nlittle microglomerulus.\nAnd that die is taken up by\na projection neuron, the one\nand only one projection neuron\nthat has a terminal there.\nAnd here you can see the axon\nof that projection neuron\nas it makes terminals in\nother parts of this calyx\nand makes connections\nwith other Kenyon cells.\nSo there it is.\nSo that's not the\nimportant part.\nThe important part is you can\ntrace back this projection\nneuron to the antenna lobe and\nsee where it got its input.\nAnd now, because\nthe antenna lobe\nis a totally stereotyped,\nstructured thing,\nyou can now read out.\nIf you know the\nantennal lobe, you\nwill know that this input\nis of a certain type.\nIt's from a certain\nset of receptors.\nSo you know right away that\nthis guy is getting input\nfrom receptor number three,\nor whoever sends projections\nto that thing.\nFurthermore, you can repeat\nthis with other terminals\nof that cell, get a\nwhole lot of projections,\nand find, essentially,\nall of the inputs--\nsometimes not all, but\nmost of the inputs--\nthat go to this Kenyon cell\nand figure out what they are.\nSo in other words,\nthe result of this,\nwithout doing EM or all\nthat, is a connectome.\nIt's the connection matrix\nbetween the glomeruli,"], "1290": [13, 80, "And there are 50 up around\nhere, plus some hot and cold\nand some other stuff.\nBut basically, the 50\nglomeruli are at the top.\nAnd 200 Kenyon cells that were\nmeasured going down the side.\nNot all 2,000 Kenyon\ncells were measured.\nThese are not measured\nfrom the same animal.\nBut you basically get\nthis connectivity matrix.\nA red little square here\nmeans that this connection\nwas found for this Kenyon cell.\nAnd a yellow one means\na double connection.\nThere were actually two\nconnections between that Kenyon\ncell and that glomerulus.\nSo there's the matrix.\nSo then my job at this\npoint was say, well, what's\nthe structure of this matrix?\nAnd that's a trickier problem.\nI mean, you look at it by eye,\nyou say, well, it looks random.\nIt just looks like\na bunch of dots.\nBut what you have\nto remember, and I\nthink this is a\nreally important thing\nto remember in\nconnectomes, is connectomes\ndon't come labeled, all right?\nSo this matrix is arranged\nin the following way.\nThis is alphabetical,\nwhich probably is not\nof fundamental\nneuroscience significance.\nAnd this is the order in\nwhich the cells were measured,\nwhich is also probably not\nof neuroscience significance.\nSo the question is,\nis there any way\nto permute the rows and\ncolumns of this matrix\nto get a structure?\nThat's the question you\nhave to answer here.\nAnd just let me show\nyou an example of that."], "1370": [14, 30, "but it's exactly the\nsame kind of matrix.\nIn fact, it probably looks to\nyou pretty much like the data.\nIt doesn't have the colors,\nbut other than that.\nSo here's a data matrix.\nBut this one I made up.\nAnd it turns out, of\ncourse, I knew the trick\nthat if you re-sort, if you\npermute the rows and columns,\nit looks like this.\nSo just because\nthat looks random\ndoes not at all mean\nthere's no structure there.\nSo you have to do\na lot of analysis"], "1400": [15, 10, "So one of the first\nthings you could do--\nrandom doesn't mean uniform.\nSo one thing you can do is\njust sum down the columns here"], "1410": [16, 70, "make?\nAnd it's not uniform.\nIt's quite uneven.\nHere's the histogram.\nBut really, the question\nwe ask is, is there\nsomething more to it?\nFor example, if a Kenyon cell\ngets one of these inputs,\nis it more likely to also\nget one of those inputs?\nAre there any correlations here?\nAnd that's really the question.\nAnd we did a whole\nlot of analysis.\nAnd the answer's no.\nI'm not going to\ntake you through it.\nThat all the tests\nwe could possibly\ndo are completely consistent\nwith just randomly selecting\nfrom this probability\ndistribution\nwithout independent ID,\nor whatever it's called.\nOK, so there are other\npapers, an earlier paper\nand a later paper,\nthat essentially\ncome to the same conclusion.\nWhat's interesting about the\nMurthy, Fiete, and Laurent\npaper is they actually\nprovide some evidence\nthat, in fact, it's different\nin different animals.\nThis doesn't prove that\nbecause this is already\ntaken from different animals.\nI'm not going to\npresent that evidence.\nBut there is\nevidence that this is\ndifferent in different animals.\nSo this looks like\na random structure."], "1480": [17, 90, "Seven seems awfully small to\nus cortico-centric people.\nAnd so why seven?\nWell, you can do a\nfollowing little exercise.\nYou can say, suppose that\nthe Kenyon cells only had\none connection.\nThen how many duplicate\nKenyon cells would there be?\nWell, there are only 50\npossible types of input, right?\nThere are 50 types\nof Kenyon grand cell.\nSo if you only\nhave one connection\nand you're making\n2,000 cells, you're\ngoing to get tons of repeats,\nhundreds of thousands\nof pairs that are identical.\nSo that you would\nnot spread out.\nNow, you can do this calculation\nfor two connections, three\nconnections, four connections.\nAnd it goes down.\nAnd if you look at the\nline where you'd only\nexpect one pair to be the same,\nthe mushroom body-- in fact,\nif you average, it's\nbetween six and seven.\nIt's right in there.\nThe mushroom body is\nright at the point\nwhere you convince yourself\nthat most of the time every cell\nwill be different.\nAnd then why go any further?\nSome of you may know something\nabout the cerebellum.\nThese are like granule\ncells of the cerebellum.\nGranule cells in the\ncerebellum typically\nhave four or five\ninputs [INAUDIBLE]..\nThey're small cells with\nclaws with very few inputs.\nAnd their axons\nform parallel fibers\nand then can get connected\nby Purkinje cells.\nThis system is the\nsame, if you notice.\nThe parallel fibers\nare forming the trunk"], "1570": [18, 60, "So these are like granule cells.\nOK, so where are we?\nSo we've got to get a\nsignal out of this thing\nor it's completely\nuseless, right?\nSo we've got this random\nsignal into this beast.\nSo what do the output\nneurons look like?\nThere's an output\nneuron, one of them.\nAnd what you might\nnotice is it's\ngoing to a very\ncompact region right\nat the head of this alpha--\nI don't know if this is an\nalpha or an alpha prime.\nBut it's going to one or\nthe other of those lobes.\nSo it's very restricted\nin its dendrites.\nAnd then off it goes carrying\nthe signal wherever it's going.\nSo in fact, I tried\nto argue earlier\nthat the output neurons\nin a mushroom body\nhave gone back to\nthis other mode.\nVery few cells per type.\nPractically as many\ntypes as output cells.\nAnd a very small\nnumber of cells.\nAnd if you took a picture of\nthis cell in another animal,\nit would look exactly the same."], "1630": [19, 60, "that if you take the\nmushroom body lobe--\nso this is this L-shaped\nstructure at the bottom,\nor it's really at the front\nof the mushroom body--\nand you peel off the\ngamma lobe, the gamma\nwould sit there but it would\nkind of block your view.\nSo it's been peeled off here.\nSo you have this\nalpha beta lobe.\nThat's one set of axons\nthat have bifurcated.\nAnd they come in sort of\nhere and then bifurcate.\nYou have the alpha prime\nbeta lobe bifurcating.\nAnd then you have\nthis third gamma lobe.\nThat divides up each of\nthese into five sections.\nThey're numbered like this,\nbut there are five of them, OK?\nAlpha 1, 2, 3 and beta 1, 2.\nSo each of these guys gets\ndivided into five compartments.\nAnd then there's an extra\ncompartment right here\ncalled the peduncle, where--\nhere's the mushroom head.\nHere's the stock.\nAnd then you get this.\nAnd right at the base of the\nstock, there's another one."], "1690": [20, 30, "by genetically targeting\nthese cells very precisely.\nIt is summarized\nby this picture.\nSo this shows different\ntypes of these output\nneurons in different colors.\nAnd what you can\nsee

here.\nThese colors refer\nto the transmitter\nof the output neuron.\nSo all the glutamate\nguys are over here.\nAll the GABA guys are down here.\nThe cholinergic\nguys are over here."], "1760": [22,

quite\ntrue what I said."], "1930": [29, 10, "And then there is a\nlayered system put on."], "1940": [30, 10, "depicted it down here\nmore schematically.\nWhat you have in\nthis output system\nis a one layer system down\nhere, a two layer system,"], "1950": [31, 10, "So the output is actually\na four layer network,\nfeedforward network."], "1960": [32, 90, "And all of the action occurs\non the

interesting\nis now the loop closes.\nSo the regions that receive\noutput from the mushroom body\nalso provide input to\nthe dopamine neurons.\nSo when the mushroom body\nacts, the dopamine neurons\nknow about it.\nAnd when the dopamine\nneurons react,\nthe mushroom body\nknows about it.\nSo you have this closed system\nwhich finally loops together.\nAnd the dopamine system\nis a reporter of behavior.\nSo it tells the mushroom\nbody what the fly's doing.\nOr also internal state,\nhow the fly's feeling.\nI'll show you that in a second.\nAnd then these are going\nto be, obviously, some sort\nof learned or\nmodulating responses,\nmodulated by this system.\nYou remember that these cannot\nhave any intrinsic meaning,\nbecause they've gone\nthrough a random stage here.\nThey cannot be assigned meaning\nwithout some sort of learning"], "2050": [33, 110, "So these are learned outputs.\nAnd so that's the system.\nOK, so what does this system do?\nOne of the nice things\nthat's happened in parallel\nwith this anatomical advance\nthat I've been describing\nis a behavioral advance of\nwhat's the mushroom for.\nI'll start with the\nclassic picture.\nMushroom body has been\nstudied for a long, long time.\nThat quote was from 1850.\nAnd it's mostly been studied\nas a classical conditioning\nsystem, memory system.\nYou train a fly to\nbe afraid of an odor\nor to be attracted to an\nodor through a classical\nconditioning experiment.\nAnd here's a nice,\nrecent version\nof that that's\nquite instructive.\nSo in this experiment,\nwhat you do is\nyou put one odor in the end of\na chamber, a very small chamber\nthat holds a fly.\nOne odor comes in one end.\nOne odor comes in the other end.\nYou pump it out in the middle.\nAnd then you track the fly.\nFlies pace back and forth.\nAnd so the fly paces\nback and forth.\nBut frequently, if it\ndoesn't like odor B,\nit might come to this central\nregion, say, oh, that's odor B,\nturn around and go back.\nAnd so what you do is\ncount electronically\nhow many times the fly\ncrosses these boundaries.\nAnd you can get a\nmeasure of its preference\nfor being in the A\nend or the B end.\nAnd this is experiments done in\nGero Miesenboeck's laboratory.\nNow, what you can do then is--\nin the first set of\nexperiments that I'll show you,\nthey just look at\nthe innate preference\nof the fly for an odor,\nwithout any training.\nThat's due to the lateral\nhorn, as you'll see.\nBut then you can associate\none of the odors,\nfor example, with\nan electric shock.\nAnd presumably, the fly\nis going to then associate"], "2160": [34, 40, "So here's the data.\nNo, first I guess I\nbuilt a little model.\nSo it's been long suspected\nhow this could work.\nThis is quite easy.\nYou have-- there are\nthe Kenyon cells.\nHere's a mushroom\nbody, output neuron.\nHere's a dopamine neuron.\nSo an odor comes along-- that's\nthe conditioned stimulus--\nactivates some Kenyon cells.\nThen the unconditioned stimulus\ncomes along, the shock.\nThat activates the\ndopamine neuron.\nAnd where you have activity\nplus dopamine, for example,\nyou strengthen the synapses.\nThere's evidence\nthat it actually\nmight work by weakening the\nsynapses, but for this diagram,\nI strengthen the synapses, OK?"], "2200": [35, 10, "it activates the same set.\nNow you have these\nstrengthened synapses.\nYou activate the mushroom\nbody output neuron\nand you send an alarm signal."], "2210": [36, 90, "And here are the data\nshowing it works.\nSo first of all, this is\nthe innate preference.\nWhat's interesting--\nthe reason I\nincluded this\nlater experiment is\nbecause they looked at the\ninnate preference as well\nas the learned preference.\nSo this is just\nshowing you that this\nis the distance between the\nPN activity for these odors.\nSo this is a measure of\nthe discriminability.\nAnd they sort of argue\nthat these odors which\nhave a zero\npreference maybe can't\nbe distinguished by the fly.\nYou don't know that,\nbut any rate, zero\nmeans they're equally\nlikely to go to both ends.\nSo these odors, they don't care.\nBut when the odors\nare quite different,\nthey can have a fairly\nstrong preference\nfor one odor over the other.\nNow you train, and\nsuddenly you have\na strong preference or a strong\navoidance, a preference for one\nover the one that was\nassociated with shock.\nAnd now what they\ndid was genetically--\nI mentioned that we\nnow have genetic access\nto all these cells.\nOne of the things you can do\nis block synaptic transmission\nfrom all the Kenyon cells.\nSo you just wipe out the\noutput of the mushroom body.\nThat's done by raising the\ntemperature of these flies.\nAnd suddenly, they go right\nback to their innate preferences\nas if they'd never\nlearned something.\nBut they still can\nsense the odor.\nThey still have their\ninnate preference,\nalmost identical to\nwhat it was before.\nBut they've lost."], "2300": [37, 30, "they'll pop back up to there.\nOK, that's classical\nconditioning.\nOh, I know what I was\ngoing to mention here.\nNot in these experiments,\nbut in other experiments,\nyou can replace\nthe electric shock\nby an activation of\nthe dopamine neuron.\nSo you can show that these\navoidance type dopamine\nneurons really do convey the\navoidance message, because you"], "2330": [38, 30, "was an activation, let's say\nan optogenetic activation\nof a dopamine neuron.\nThat's been done tons now.\nOK, so here's another example.\nAs I said, I think the classic\nliterature on the fly is that.\nIt's classical conditioning\nstudied in zillions of ways,\nlooking at the molecular\nbasis, et cetera, et cetera.\nBut here's some\nmore newer results.\nHere's one from Daisuke\nHattori in Richard's lab."], "2360": [39, 40, "to show you what it is.\nAnd it has the\nfollowing features.\nSo it's a little\nhard to see, maybe,\nbut this is a pulse that\nshows that the odor, which\nis MCH here, the odor\nhas been introduced.\nAnd here is the response of this\nalpha prime 3 output neuron.\nSo there you're\nseeing a response.\nAnd if you look across time,\nthat response fades away.\nIt even starts to reverse maybe.\nSo there's an adaptation\nof this response.\nYou say, big deal.\nBut this adaptation\nis definitely\noccurring at the output\nof the mushroom body.\nThe Kenyon cells\nare not adapting.\nIt's due to the dopamine,\nbecause if you block"], "2400": [40, 40, "So this is dopamine\nspecific adaptation.\nBut what's more interesting\nabout it is shown here,\nthat if you take an odor\nresponse to MCH, adapt it\naway, but then\npresent a new odor,\nbenzaldehyde, now you\nget a response again.\nThen you can adapt the way the\nresponse of the benzaldehyde\nand introduce a third\norder, you get a thing.\nSo this is an\nodor-dependent adaptation,\nwhich really suggests that\nthe dopamine is specifically\nweakening the synapses\nthat are active at the time\nof the dopamine response.\nSo it's like the\nclassical conditioned,"], "2440": [41, 50, "Furthermore, when you adapt\none odor and then another,\nthe first order remains adapted.\nSo I sort of see this system--\nI've always had trouble\nwith the classical condition\nexperiments, imagining\nwhere would a fly\nget into a situation\nwhere it smells an odor\nand gets a shock, or\nsomething like that?\nBut this, you can immediately\nsee, would be very useful.\nYou could adapt\nto an environment\nthat has a whole set of odors.\nAnd then if you come\nback to that environment\nand there's a new\nodor present, you'll\nimmediately know it,\nbecause this neuron\nis going to respond.\nWhereas if you come back to\nthe identical environment,\nor without new odors,\nthis won't respond.\nSo this is a neuron to\nidentify unexpected olfactory\nfeatures of an environment."], "2490": [42, 10, "OK, I think I just repeated that\nbecause I wanted to say that.\nHere's another example."], "2500": [43,

a hole in its head.\nOther than that,\neverything's fine.\nSo it's an unhappy fly.\nYou might want to speculate\nthat this is an unhappy fly.\nAnd what they observed\nis while the fly is\nflailing about and unhappily\nexpressing its unhappiness,\nthese gamma 2 and\ngamma 3 compartments\nhave dopamine input.\nAnd the gamma 4\nand gamma 5 don't.\nBut they also observed\nthat every once in a

output neuron.\nThey present an odor.\nAnd they activate the\ndopamine neuron themselves.\nSo when they don't activate\nthe dopamine neuron,\nthis is a measure of\nsynaptic transmission."], "2640": [47, 50, "When they do, it\ngets much stronger.\nSo now what you\nhave is something--\nI mean, I think if I saw\nthis in cortex, I'd go wild--\nis a gating effect.\nYou have internal state\naffecting

thing, which\nmight say, approach that order.\nYou know, be sort of a\nlittle more easy going.\nIf you're unhappy, then an\nodor response gets relayed out\nthis pathway.\nAnd it might tell you to\nbe afraid of all odors,\nor something like that.\nBe very cautious.\nSo you start to\nsee in this system"], "2690": [48, 50, "That, to me, is a very\nexciting thing to see.\nOK, here's another one--\ninternal state affects memory.\nThis is from Tanimoto, another\ncollaboration with the Janelia\nlab.\nSo you can do the same\nkind of experiment\nI showed you before with\nshock, only do it with sweet.\nSo in this case, it's a T maze.\nA fly comes in this way.\nAnd you associate, let's say,\nodor A with a sweet reward.\nThen the fly is going to come\nin here and most of the time\ngo this way.\nFlies are never 100%\nperformers, but they'll\ntend to go to odor A because\nthey associate that with sweet,\nprovided they're hungry.\nI'll come back to\nthe hungry part.\nSo you take a

get\nnutritional value,"], "2750": [50, 50, "And the decoupling of those\ncauses us a lot of problems.\nSo you see that here\nin this system very,\nvery well, because they take\na sugar that's sweet

short-term\nattraction to that odor,\nenough to buy the\nnext Coke, sort of.\nIt's conveyed\nthrough octopamine,\nso the sweetness\nactivates octopamine.\nOctopamine activates a certain\nset of these

don't actually know--\nbut it changes synapses\nin the alpha 1 lobe.\nAnd now you get a\nlong-term memory.\nSo flies are smarter\nthan people in a way.\nThey'll only do this\nlong-term memory"], "2840": [52, 30, "to whatever they're eating.\nOK, so very elegant thing.\nAnd then I think this\nis my final example--\nI'll start winding up--\nfrom Scott Waddell's\nlab, that another feature\nof this sweet thing is\nif the fly's not hungry,\nnot surprisingly, it\ndoesn't care anymore.\nSo it's associated odor A with\nsweet, but now it's well-fed,\nso who cares.\nAnd that's a real effect."], "2870": [53, 80, "But it still has the memory,\nbecause if you then starve it,\nnow it will go to odor A.\nOK, So what Scott Waddell\nand his group realized\nwas that this was activated\nthrough this dopamine neuron.\nNow, this was done before all\nthis circuitry was derived.\nBut they figured it out that\nit's this dopamine neuron,\nbecause they could activate\nthis dopamine neuron\nand simulate the fed state, so\nthe fly would ignore the odor.\nOr they could silence\nthis dopamine neuron\nand then they would\nsimulate the hungry state\nand the fly would be\nattracted to the odor.\nBut now,

true.\nOne should never assume that.\nBut we now have this pathway.\nPeople-- we, I say, but people,\nwe can block this pathway.\nThere's enough known about the\ncircuitry to really work out\nthat

like CO2.\nAnd the reason that\nis is in a group\nof flies that are stressed,\nthey release a lot of CO2.\nSo a fly will sense CO2, know\nthere's trouble in the area,\nand will avoid it.\nSo there's a natural avoidance\nthrough the innate pathway\nto CO2.\nNow, that's kind of a fatal\nflaw in the design of the fly,\nbecause flies eat rotting fruit\nthat releases tons of CO2.\nSo you don't want to\navoid your food source.\nSo what happens-- it's\nnot completely understood.\nBut somehow, the innate system\ntrains this beta 2 pathway\nto have, in addition to the\ninnate pathway, a learned\npathway for CO2 avoidance.\nAnd in the hungry state,\nthe fly channels its CO2--\nit still has CO2 avoidance.\nIt channels it\nthrough this pathway.\nThen if, at the same time,\nthere are fruit odors or fruit\ntastes, it can\nmodulate this pathway,\nshut it down, and\nturn the CO2 avoidance\ninto a CO2 attraction.\nSo again, you start to\nsee the neural substrates"], "3030": [55, 140,
