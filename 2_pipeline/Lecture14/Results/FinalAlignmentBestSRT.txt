{"0": [0, 190, "GARY GENSLER: Welcome\nback to Fintech:\nShaping the Financial World.\nThis is our last time together.\nAnd so we're going to\ntry to summarize up\nwhat this semester's been and\nsome thoughts going forward\nas all of you go\nforth, and try to think\nabout this intersection\nof technology and finance.\nAnd again, we've taught it\nfrom that point of view,\nnot necessarily just\nabout startups, but how\ntechnology and\nfinance come together\nin the world of finance.\nAnd it's been shaping it,\nreally, for centuries.\nBut the dominant sort of themes\nthat we've been talking about\nis the new technologies that,\nin the last five to 15 years,\nhave really been\ntransforming finance\naround artificial\nintelligence and machine\nlearning, natural\nlanguage processing,\nhaving dramatic changes, but\nalso open API and the access\nto data through technological\nconnections, sometimes done\nby commerce, sometimes the\nofficial sector has sort of\nmoved and pressed against it.\nAnd then, of course, data,\nand all the different forms\nof alternative data, some off\nof just traditional means,\nlike whether we pay our rent on\ntime, some from social media.\nAnd then when we\nlooked at insurtech,\nthat I know really\nlifted the class up,\nthis look at\ninsurance and finance,\nbut then also telematics,\nmeaning all the data\nthat a car brings\non us, or wearables,\nif we wear a Fitbit or\na watch or something,\nor the Internet of Things.\nAnd then we've talked even\nabout some technologies that\nhaven't yet come into\nthe technology stack,\nlike blockchain\ntechnology, and will it?\nIt's already been a\ncatalyst for change,\nbut will it sort of come in and\ndramatically change finance.\nSo as we normally do, if we can\ntry to be part of the community\nand have our videos on, I\nstill see some with it off.\nI know at 12 lectures in,\nand it's early morning.\nBut I think if we can just\ntry to close out together\nwith our videos on, and\nif you have questions,\nraising the little\nZoom blue hand\nor going into the chat room.\nAnd Romain is going\nto take a close look\nand try to have a dialogue here.\nI do have some slides to put up.\nI'm still the same faculty\nmember of the other 11 classes,\nbut let me share some\nslides and we'll get going.\nSo we're going to talk a\nlittle bit about this finance"], "190": [1, 30, "the actors again, and then\na review of the key areas,\nmachine learning, open\nAPI, credit scoring,\nalternative data,\nand the question\nmarks around\nblockchain technology.\nAnd then a quick sector review,\nand bringing those all together\nand wrapping it up"], "220": [2, 1070, "And so I don't know if everybody\njust wants to have an easy,\nhit the ball out\nof the park moment.\nBut to you all, what is\nfintech and how might it\nshape the future?\nROMAIN: This is the last class\nand your last opportunity\nto shine, guys.\nGARY GENSLER: Don't you love how\nRomain sort of pulls it all out\nof you so readily, easily?\nROMAIN: This is the last class.\nDanielle, go ahead.\nAUDIENCE: The\napplication of technology\nto financial services,\nand how might\nit shape the future of money\nand finance in unlimited ways.\nGARY GENSLER: An optimist.\nI like that about you, Dani.\nUnlimited ways.\nSo do you think we'll\nhave banks in the future?\nLet's go right to\nthe heart of it.\nWill we have commercial\nbanks in the future?\nAUDIENCE: I think yes.\nI think it's hard to\ndislodge institutions\nwith that much inertia.\nBut they may not look\nthe way they look.\nThey may get\nslightly more agile,\nadapt, and have\ndigital currency.\nThey might pull in some\nof the fintech disruptors.\nSo yes, we'll have\ncommercial banks,\nbut they may not look\nprecisely like they do today.\nGARY GENSLER: I, too, think that\nwe'll have commercial banks.\nAnd I think it's more\nthan just inertia.\nI think that there's certain\nnetwork effects that we've\nseen for centuries about\nbringing depositors\nand borrowers together and\nforming that intersection, sort\nof like a neck of an\nhourglass, but forming\nthat intersection where the\ngrains of sand, money and risk,\nflow between depositors who\nhave money but want to save it,\nand borrowers who\nwant to borrow it,\nand the commercial banks\nbring that together.\nPeer to peer lending\nhas been around now\nfor some 15 years, this\nconcept that we don't need\nan intermediary in the middle.\nAnd then maybe\nborrowers and lenders\ncan come together on\na technology platform.\nAnd it's had some success,\nnot just here in the US,\nbut it started in Europe.\nIt's been here in the US.\nIt's been in China with great\nnumbers and some challenges\nas well.\nBut I think what we've seen\nis, by and large, we still\nhave some centralized\nmarketplaces that\ncome together.\nNow that's not the only reason\nI think commercial banking will\nbe around, but I think there\nare significant network\neffects pulling at the center.\nHow do you best assess the\nviability of a fintech project?\nROMAIN: Carlos, you like\nto take a stab at that?\nAUDIENCE: Sure.\nSo I think there's\na couple elements.\nOne is to what degree\nis it an improvement\nrelative to a\ntraditional product?\nHow much more convenient\nis it for users?\nAnd how much more\naccessible is it?\nI think those are\nimportant factors.\nOf course, there's a\nfinancial liability.\nYou have to look at the actual\neconomics of the product\nto see whether or not\nit's scalable, above all,\nand whether it makes sense\nto have it at a large degree.\nAnd then ultimately,\nI think we've\nseen, especially\nthe last five years,\nwhether fintech\ncompanies can actually\nbecome publicly owned companies,\nhow they handle themselves\nin the stock market, et cetera.\nSo I think there's been several\nphases to the evolution,\nand it's continuing.\nGARY GENSLER: So very\nhelpful, in part.\nSo first Carlos said\nfundamentally, you have\nto have a value proposition.\nI'm using my words, but\nsort of translating it,\nif that's all right, Carlos.\nSo what pain points\nare you addressing?\nWhat gap in the current\nsystem of finance?\nAnd it might be about user\ninterface and user experience.\nAnd as mobile phones\ncame along, as we\nmoved from online banking\nand online trading\nto mobile banking and\nmobile trading that,\ncreates opportunities.\nMany of those opportunities\nhave already happened.\nThey're not all done, but\nmany of those opportunities\nof that transition from bricks\nand mortar to the internet,\nto mobile phones, have happened.\nBut they create opportunities\nof user experience and user\ninterface.\nBut it has to address some\npain point, do something\nquicker, cheaper, better.\nIt's an old saw in\nterms of strategy.\nBut then Carlos is\nalso saying we need\nto have financial viability.\nAt some point in\ntime, you have to be\nable to build a model where\nrevenues are more than costs.\nA lot of these startups are\nlooking for that sweet spot,\nthat sort of nirvana\nmoment when you\nbuild a platform, where platform\neconomics and the network\neffects take off.\nBut Carlos said you\nstill have to have\nsome financial viability\nat some point in time.\nI think there was\nanother hand up, Romain.\nAUDIENCE: Yeah, I think to kind\nof built on Carlos's point,\nanother thing that might\nmake or break a product\nis potential for fraud\nor the risk profile\nincrease on a specific area.\nOne thing we were kind of\ntalking about as a group\nwas alternative scoring,\nand that's something\nthat we're just\nnot sure if we're\nhot on or not just\nbecause is taking\nalternative data actually going\nto increase or reduce risks\nlooking forward.\nGARY GENSLER: So\nMichael, I think\nwhat you're saying\nis you still have\nto live within\nregulatory constraints\nand social constraints in terms\nof there's normative behavior,\nand this is a highly regulated\nfield, and for good reason.\nWe're dealing with\ntrust, and trust\nis at the center of finance.\nWe're also dealing with other\npeople's money and livelihood\nand savings and investments.\nAnd so there's\ninvestor protection,\nthere's consumer protection, and\nin terms of alternative data,\nthe basic tenets\naround the globe\nthat when you extend credit\nor offer somebody insurance,\nit should be done\nfairly and unbiased.\nAnd so how do we ensure that\nthe use of alternative data\nstill stays within those social\nand legal norms about offering\ncredit and insurance in\nan unbiased and fair way.\nI think that's what you\nwere chatting about.\nAUDIENCE: Yeah, kind of.\nI was just thinking about, also,\nthe lack of adoption crypto.\nIt's like, if it's just\ngoing to sort of attract\nscammers and\nfraudulent activity,\nthe technology is going to\nhave a hard time being adopted.\nGARY GENSLER: Right.\nRight.\nSo of course we want to protect\nagainst fraud in the capital\nmarkets.\nWe also want to protect\nagainst manipulation\nand ensure investment\nprotection.\nAnd we've seen,\nparticularly in some fields\nlike cryptocurrencies,\nthat they're\nrife with fraud and manipulation\nand sort of quick buck artists,\nfrankly, around the globe.\nAnd so to ensure that\nany long-term viability\nof a project, real\nviability comes\nwith investor protection,\nconsumer protection norms,\nas well as norms about fairness,\ninclusiveness, explainability,\nand the like.\nIn most nations, these are\nembedded in various regulations\nand laws.\nSo standing up a new\neffort, whether it's inside\nof an incumbent, inside\na big tech, or a startup,\nyou've got to look at\nthe regulatory context.\nBut Michael's\npointing out, also,\nyou've got to go\na little further\nand make sure that\nyou're really serving\nyour public and your community.\nAnd then the last question\nis, I hope that we've\nmet the goals of the class.\nBut I do ask you today and over\nthe next few weeks, write me.\nWrite me at\ngensler@mit.edu and tell me\nwhat we could do better.\nThis the first year\nwe've stood this up.\nThis class is also going\nto be shown publicly\nin MIT'S OpenCourseWare.\nSo those of you that might\nbe watching this publicly,\nwrite me and tell me what we can\ndo in this class going forward\nand how we can make\nit a better product.\nI'm kind of curious\nwhether it's made\nsome folks more bullish or\nmore bearish on fintech,\nand I'm going to ask this\nat the end of class as well,\nbut if there's anybody who\nwants to chat now, Romain?\nAnybody want to take the bullish\nside or the bearish side?\nROMAIN: Danielle\nhas her hand up.\nAUDIENCE: I think it depends\non which hat I have on,\nif I'm an investor\nor entrepreneur.\nThe class has made\nme more bullish.\nLots of opportunities out there.\nIf I have my citizen hat on,\nI think I net out at bearish,\nnot so much on the industry,\nbut more on its impact for me.\nI'm certainly thrilled\nat the ability\nto access different forms\nof payment and lending.\nBut ultimately, I think\nthe long-term costs\nin terms of the data\nthese companies will\nhave on me, and the\njust immense role\nand control over my life,\nI net out at bearish.\nAnd then if I'm\nthe government, I'm\nprobably netting out at\nbearish as well because this\nis going to mean a gnarly\nset of regulations and laws\nto navigate that means\na lot more work for me.\nGARY GENSLER: Very interesting,\nvery nuanced answer.\nI see some other hands up.\nROMAIN: Celi?\nGARY GENSLER: Maybe you've\ngot your mute on still.\nROMAIN: Yes, we can't hear you.\nOK.\nThen let's move on to Lamide.\nAUDIENCE: Yeah.\nI'm more bullish.\nFor me one of the\ninteresting trends\nI see is serving\nthe underserved,\nwhether that's in crypto trying\nto serve the population that\ndoesn't have to be VC, or\nwhether it's in insurance.\nyou have all these\ntrends where people\nare getting more nuanced\nproducts to really target\npopulations that\nare underserved.\nAnd all these different kind\nof new innovations around that\ninspire me.\nGARY GENSLER: So we've\ngot bullish as an investor\nfrom Dani.\nWe've got bullish for economic\ninclusion and product inclusion\njust now from Lamide.\nBut there were some\nbearishness from Dani\non data and the industry\nknowing so much more about us.\nWas there anybody else,\nRomain, that wanted to add in?\nROMAIN: Maybe Celi, if her\nmicrophone works, and Luke.\nGARY GENSLER: Right.\nAnd then we'll move on.\nWe'll take Luke and Celi.\nAUDIENCE: Yeah.\nMy internet connection's poor.\nBut I think I'd like to echo--\nI missed part of Lamide's but my\nthing was financial inclusion.\nSo really entering,\nI think, also, it's\nin the benefit of\nthe government, too.\nI know that there are\nsome concerns there,\nbut I think if you're\nthinking about it\nfrom an economic\ngrowth perspective,\nthere's a lot of\nopportunity through fintech\nthat would end up really\nbenefit the entire economy.\nSo I think that there's the\nargument for the government\nto have interest and to be\na more bullish approach as\nwell, even though there\nare risks involved.\nGARY GENSLER: So you\naccept a little bit\nwhat Dani was saying\nthat for the government,\nthe official sector, some of the\nchallenges, to use her words,\nwere gnarly.\nBut though there's challenges,\nyou think to the extent\nthat it promotes inclusion\nand economic activity,\nthat innovation is a net\ngood, and competition,\nif I can insert something.\nWhat fintech does is it\nprovides an opportunity\nboth for incumbents and\nstartups and big competitors\nlike big tech to start to\nbring competitive challenges.\nWe saw this in China\nwhen Ally Pay and WeChat\nPay bring economic challenges\nto the banking sector\nand now dominate the\nretail payment space.\nBut for a while, all\nof that inclusion\ncreates economic opportunity.\nI say for a while because\nat some point in time,\nthen they too become\na bit of an oligopoly.\nAnd they can charge, over\ntime, economic rents.\nBut that has certainly\nbrought a lot of inclusion,\na lot of growth, a lot\nof economic opportunity\nto underserved\npopulations, in that case,\nin China and elsewhere in Asia.\nWe've also seen that\nacross the US and in Europe\nwith competition from challenger\nbanks and neo banks and payment\ncompanies, long ago, like PayPal\nstarted 20 years ago, or more\nrecently, by many of the payment\ninnovators in this space,\nwhether they're data\naggregators or direct payment\nsolutions like Toast in\nthe restaurant business.\nBut as Dani said\nalso, the Plaids,\nwhich are the data aggregators,\nor even the Credit Karmas\ngiving us free access\nto our credit reports,\nor Robin Hood giving\nus free access\nto trading online\nbrokerage, also\nthen are collecting\nsignificant amount of data.\nAnd whether they're\ncommercializing that data\nin ways we understand,\nappreciate, and want,\nDani is sort of\nraising that makes her\na little uncomfortable as well.\nAnd I think we were going\nto close it out with Luke.\nAUDIENCE: So I'm\nbullish in the long term\nin the sense that two\nconditions are met,\nthe convenience and then\ntechnology acceptance in terms\nof blockchain.\nYou teach blockchain and money.\nAnd if people accept blockchain\nas technology as core\nto fintech, it has\na lot of potentials.\nIf not, this is nothing more\nthan making any status quo\nindustry more convenient\nand more accessible.\nSo little bearish.\nGARY GENSLER: So\nyou're bullish, and one\nof the reasons you're bullish\nis you feel the blockchain\ntechnology is a positive.\nAnd is that positive\nbecause you feel\nit's pushing at the\nside of central banks,\npushing at the side of\ncentral payment processors\nand the rest of finance,\nwhich I would share that view.\nI think it's a catalyst.\nAnd it's part of why we've\nseen a lot of innovation.\nEven our US Federal\nReserve, who was thinking\nabout doing 24 hour a day, seven\ndays a week payment systems,\nis rolling out something\ncalled Fed Now.\nI think that's in part because\nof this catalyst for change.\nBut do you also think that it\nwill be a mainstream product\noffering, and that\nblockchain technology will\nroll into what I call the\ntechnology stack in finance?\nAUDIENCE: Well, I\nbelieve in evolution,\nso in 10 years or whatever\nyears that may take,\nthis is indeed the\nbest technology\nif everyone accepts it.\nSo I don't see why not.\nHowever, it will take\na tremendous amount\nof time and energy and\neffort for everyone\nto accept it and understand it.\nEither it takes a\ncrisis or it takes\ngovernmental intervention.\nGARY GENSLER: You may be right.\nI still haven't been convinced,\nbut you may be right.\nI'm sort of a\nmiddle of the road.\nI'm neither a minimalist\nor a maximalist\non blockchain technology.\nBut it hasn't yet because\nof the dominant challenges\nof governance.\nHow do you have multiple\nparties sharing a ledger?\nAnd these issues of\ngovernance are not new.\nThey're just in this context\nof blockchain technology.\nBut the opportunity to have a\nnew data structure, a shared\ndata structure amongst\nmultiple parties,\nI think you're probably right,\nwill come into use somewhere.\nThe question is how\nbroadly because you\nhave at the center a really--\nDani used the word\ngnarly, but maybe\nif I use that here, gnarly\nset of governance issues,\nhow you have a shared data\nstructure, a shared ledger.\nAnd then, of course,\nin cryptocurrencies\nis another set of challenges.\nIs a private sector\ncurrency needed?\nWell, if fiat currencies\nare well managed,\nif monetary policy\nand fiscal policies\nare well managed, probably not.\nBut then again, the history of\nnations, the history of finance\nand money of 200 countries,\nthere tends to be one to three\nat any given time that\naren't managing their fiat\ncurrencies well.\nSo there you have it.\nAUDIENCE: One last notice.\nOnly when governments' interest\naligns with the blockchain,\nbecause fiat currency's\ncentralized and blockchain is\ndecentralized, would we have a\nwide acceptance of blockchain,\ncorrect?\nGARY GENSLER:\nThat's a good point,\nthat the sovereign\ncurrency is probably here\nunless there's\nsome collaboration\nbetween the central authorities\nand the use of that technology\nis your point.\nSo we're going to\ndive in a little bit.\nAnd just sort of\nsummarizing, I talk"], "1290": [3, 590, "And the cloud,\nmobile, the internet\nwere important parts that were\nadded to the finance technology\nstack, really, from the\n1990s all the way till now.\nAnd if you look at\nbig finance, all\nusing the internet, of\ncourse, from the late '90s,\nand into the naughts,\nall pretty much\nrolling out mobile applications,\nparticularly in the last 10\nyears, often because of the\npressures from startups.\nNot so much all have\nrolled in the cloud.\nAnd many big finance\ncompanies are still having\ntheir centralized\ndata structures.\nBut more and more\nare using the cloud.\nWhat's important\nabout the cloud,\nthough, is that it gives\nstartups a real chance\nto sort of rent versus bill.\nSo you don't have to build\nyour own data structure,\nput it in Microsoft Azure,\nput it in an Amazon AWS,\nput it in [INAUDIBLE]\nequivalents and so forth.\nSo those were all earlier\ntechnologies fully\nin the finance technology stack.\nBut we've talked a lot\nabout in this class machine\nlearning, natural\nlanguage processing,\nthe critical pieces,\nreally, in the last call it\nseven to 10 years, that\ncomputational power\nand the ability to analyze\ndata and extract correlations.\nAnd what machine learning\nat its core does best,\nit's remarkable at extracting\ncorrelations, pattern\nrecognition, if you wish.\nAnd that pattern\nrecognition on data\nhas started to really be\nimportant in this field.\nAnd we'll talk a little\nbit more about it.\nBut it's also access to\ndata and digital interfaces\nthrough open application\nprogram interfaces, or API.\nAnd you could have machine\nlearning and natural language\nprocessing without\nopen API, but open API\nis a really important\npiece of this,\nparticularly as startups\ntry to get into this space.\nAnd as we talked\nabout, some of that's\nbecause the official sector\nsays, thou shall do this.\nSome of it is technologically\nfacilitated by companies\nthat provided that access.\nAnd then many of the incumbents\nwanted to provide it as well.\nAnd then, of course,\nthere's a whole bunch\nof things that have been\nin the technology stack\nfor decades or centuries.\nWe took those as givens.\nAnd I think at some\npoint, when this course is\ntaught in the 2030s,\nmachine learning\nwill just be taken as a given.\nOpen API will be a\ngiven, and there'll\nbe new technologies beyond that.\nNow we talked about one\nthat's really in insurance.\nAnd I kid the class a\nlittle bit because I\nknow the interest has been more\nin payments and in challenger\nbanks and neo banks.\nBut why I find insurance\nso interesting is it's\nstarting to layer a new\ntechnology into the technology\nstack.\nWe don't see this as much in the\nchallenger banks and in credit.\nBut sensor data, telematics\nin the automobiles,\nwearables and the like.\nAll that remarkable amount of\ndata to assess and underwrite\ninsurance risk, whether\nit's on an automobile,\nwhether it's on\na home, will that\ncome into the technology\nstack of banks and credit card\ncompanies?\nWe haven't yet seen it.\nBut other than sort of social\nnorms and regulatory reasons,\nwhy wouldn't we see that wealth\nof data from your automobile,\nfrom your wearables, from\nInternet of Things sensors\nwouldn't start to\ninfluence, and one\nmight say infiltrate, into\nhow credit decisions are\nmade, again, within the\nregulatory construct\nand so forth.\nSo one of the reasons why I\nfind insurance so fascinating,\nbecause there's sort\nof another technology\nthat they're starting\nto use to collect data.\nReally important.\nAnd then lastly,\nwe've talked a lot\nabout blockchain technology.\nI teach it as well.\nI find it a fascinating area.\nBut just as that back\nand forth with Luke,\nI put question marks.\nWill it come into that\nfull technology stack?\nIt's most definitely been\na catalyst for change.\nIt's pushing at the\nedges of finance.\nIt's starting to make each\ninstitution, whether it's\nJP Morgan thinking\nabout a new way\nto do payments with\nsomething called JP Morgan\nCoin, or a whole collection\nof incumbent banks\naround a project called Finality\nor utility settlement coin.\nWe have, of course,\nseen how Facebook\ncaught a great deal of\nattention in 2019 and 2020\nwith their Facebook\nLibra project,\na consortium to roll out\na new global currency,\nboth multi-basket\nand single currency.\nSo incumbents in big tech are\ntaking very close look at this.\nAnd then you have the\nCentral Bank of China,\nPeople's Bank of\nChina doing something\ncalled a digital currency\nelectronic payments program.\nIt's not using\nblockchain technology.\nBut for sure it's inspired\nby cryptocurrencies.\nIt's for sure put a higher\nemphasis for all central banks\naround the globe to consider\nwhat's called central bank\ndigital currencies.\nSo I put some question marks\nbecause we know it's already\nbeen a catalyst for change,\nbut will it actually\nbe incorporated in\nthe technology stack?\nRomain, any questions?\nROMAIN: Let's wait\njust another second.\nYes, Hassan.\nAUDIENCE: Yeah.\nI just have a question.\nNow at the beginning\nof the slide,\nyou said internet,\nmobile, and the cloud.\nWhat do you mean exactly?\nI mean, did it move\nfrom internet to cloud,\nor is is just like\na new technology?\nWhat do you mean?\nGARY GENSLER: I'm sure-- because\nyour voice is fading out--\nare you asking whether I think\nthese are new technologies?\nI think they were new\nwhen they rolled out\nthe internet fundamentally\nin the mid- to late '90s\nfor most of finance\nhad to take notice.\nBut I assure you, having\nlived it, in the early '90s,\nthe internet was not in\nthe technology stack,\nmeaning most of big finance\nand startups of the time\ndidn't use it.\nBut many of the startups\nby the late '90s had to.\nAmazon started in 1995, and they\nembedded the internet in it.\nOf course, it was what\nmade Amazon so successful.\nPayPal started in 1997\nor 1998, for instance.\nNow you can't survive if\nyou don't use the internet.\nSo that's what I'm saying there.\nAnd mobile phones similarly.\nBy and large, finance, at first,\nwas providing things online,\nor shall I say, on\nthe internet, but not\nnecessarily on a mobile app.\nAnd the first mobile apps were\nfundamentally just the same\nthat you could do\nonline, and then you\nhad to give a better user\ninterface, more adaptable,\nin essence, something\nfor the small screen\nthat our fingers can do easily\nand readily on this rather than\non a laptop.\nSo I'm saying that\ntoday, whether you're\nbig tech, big\nfinance, or a startup,\nyou have to do these things.\nYou have to do them well or you\ncan't compete fundamentally.\nBut maybe I didn't understand\nthe question, Hassan.\nAUDIENCE: I mean, when\nyou move to cloud,\nis it like supporting\nthe mobile application,\nor does it have a different use?\nGARY GENSLER: I think it\ndoes a number of things.\nGreat question.\nThe cloud, I think,\nfacilitates greater competition\nboth as a support function\nand also a cost function.\nA lot of finance is about trust.\nEmbedded in finance is\ntrust, and we give data\nto financial firms.\nWe want that data\nto be protected.\nNow earlier Dani\nraised the underbelly\nabout how they use the data.\nBut we want to protect it.\nSo by using the cloud,\nany financial competitor\ncan better insure\nfor cyber security.\nOne of the dominant things about\nthe cloud is it can lower cost.\nIt can provide a standardized\nform of data security or cyber\nsecurity.\nAnd I think it somewhat levels\nthe field of competition.\nBut it's a supporting role.\nYou're right.\nIt's not something, necessarily,\nthat's there for the users,\nfor you and me to see.\nBut we couldn't\nuse Credit Karma,\nwe couldn't use Robin\nHood, we couldn't\nuse many of the insurance apps\nif those venture capitalists\nand entrepreneurs behind it had\ndecided to build their own data\ncenters.\nThey wouldn't have\nbeen able to stand up\nwith the same scalability\nand same time frames\nat the same costs.\nSo it's facilitated a tremendous\namount of competition.\nAUDIENCE: Thank you.\nGARY GENSLER: So sometimes\nin infrastructure technology,\nI might consider the cloud\nan infrastructure technology\nrather than a user\nfacing technology.\nBut as an infrastructure\ntechnology,\nit's darn important.\nAnd so in that context,\nI've also sort of said,"], "1880": [4, 20, "bots and open API\nor what we've been\ntalking about in this class.\nBut it all builds on\nthat which came right\nbefore it, mobile phones, the\ninternet, as we just said.\nAnd we've dominantly focused\non customer interface and risk"], "1900": [5, 160, "Risk management,\nwhat we've focused\non in this class, machine\nlearning dominantly, sensors\nand telematics in\nthe insurance field,\npeer to peer lending is in\nthe risk management side.\nBut all of this\nbuilt, and could not\nhave been built without the\nasset-backed securitization.\nAnd like the cloud\nearlier, Hassan,\nif I can use that, the\ncloud is an infrastructure\ntechnology, the technology\nof risk management,\nthat you could take a pool of\nmortgages, a pool of credit\ncard receivables, a\npool of auto loans,\nand take those and sell them\ninto the securities markets,\nhas facilitated a\nnumber of startups\nto say, look, I don't\nneed to use balance sheet.\nI can maybe sell these pool\nof receivables and loans\ninto the marketplace.\nI could be more like a\nbroker, more on the front end,\nand give great\ncustomer interface,\nand then sell into the market.\nSo some risk\nmanagement tools that\nwere inventions and new\ntechnologies of the 1970s\nto the 1990s allows,\nthen, this build here.\nAnd so one of the central\nthemes of this class that I want\nyou to take away\nis not necessarily\nhow machine learning works, not\nnecessarily how open API works,\nbut how new technologies\ncome along in the past,\nand they will in the future--\nevery five to 15\nyears there's going\nto be some new technology.\nWe seven billion\nhumans haven't stopped\ncoming up with\ninnovations that are\nrelevant to the\nfinancial world--\nand as they do, think about\nhow it opens a crack, how\nit creates an opportunity.\nAnd if you're at\na big incumbent,\nif you're a Bank of\nAmerica or Mitsui Bank,\nthink about how it's going to\ncreate an opportunity not only\nfor you, but your competitors.\nAnd if you don't act upon that\nnew technology,

the central\nsort of conceptual framework"], "2060": [6, 200, "And I think that finance\nhas a fertile ground.\nAnd the important\nopportunities in finance,\ndigitization of money.\nMoney is now electronic.\nMoney itself is but\na social construct.\nBut we used to think\nabout it in physical ways.\nBefore a few decades ago, it was\nall really physical paper money\nor gold or silver.\nBut frankly.\nWe're in the 2020s.\nWe're living through\nthis coronavirus crisis.\nWe will have accentuated that.\nThere's a wide public\nacceptance of new tech.\nAnd each time there's a new\ntech, a new way to interface,\nthough finance is\na world of trust,\nwe tend to have a lot of\ntrust in new technology.\nNow often it's the\nnew generation.\nIt's going to be the Gen\nZs and the Millennials\nbefore it's going to be\nfolks of my generation.\nBut there's still a wide\nacceptance of new tech.\nLook at all of us in\nthe coronavirus crisis\nusing Zoom and online.\nIt's not as good as\nbeing in the classroom.\nI have to tell you\nthis is definitely not\nas good as being\nin the classroom,\nbut we're learning how\nto use this new tech.\nAnd the interface and\nthe processing systems\nof the legacy incumbents leaves\nopportunities for competition.\nAnd of course, we've\ntalked about data.\nI'm pausing, Romain, in\ncase there are questions.\nROMAIN: Let's give it\na few more seconds.\nWe have a question from Luke.\nAUDIENCE: Quick question.\nWhat do you think about\nencrypting the tech to money\nvia blockchain so that\nwe can kind of see where\nthe public money is spent, i.e.\nKorea is actually trying\nto think about doing that.\nYou mentioned China is\nthinking about doing that.\nThis is more possible in more\nof the East Asian countries\nversus very, very\nhigh individual rights\ncountries such as the US where\nthey might be allergic to it.\nGARY GENSLER: So you've\nembedded a whole bunch\nof parts in there.\nBut let me just say\nblockchain technology has\na positive attribute that\nit's a shared public ledger.\nOn some level, you can make\ndata on that ledger public.\nYou can also encrypt it and\nmake it not necessarily public.\nSo it depends on\nthe architecture.\nBut a blockchain technology\nwith a shared ledger\nis what often is called\ntamper resistant.\nTamper resistant,\nsome people say\nimmutable, which isn't\nquite technically correct.\nAnd so a government, or\neven a private sector firm,\ncould use it to say\nthat's a record of truth.\nThat's a record that\nis tamper resistant.\nI haven't seen any\ngovernment doing that yet.\nBut it certainly can be done.\nIt's been done more\nin the private sector.\nYou'd still have to\ntrust in the protocol.\nYou'd have to trust in whatever\nnodes or network maintain\nthat ledger.\nBut it's a possibility\ngoing forward.\nSo who are the\nactors in fintech?"], "2260": [7, 270, "Well, we've talked about them.\nBig finance, I like to\nquote the Central Bank\ngovernor of Brazil,\nwho gave me this little\nsaying where he said, big\nfinance is like fortresses.\nThey have moats and towers\nand sovereign affiliations.\nAnd I mean, it breaks\ndown a little bit, too.\nBut it has some apt\nparts of it, being\nthe towers are big finance\nare dominant in payments.\nThey have their balance sheets.\nThey, too, collect\ndata, and they're\nvast corporate\nstructures, often,\nof 1,000 to 5,000 legal\nentities around the globe.\nBut there's challenges\nto big finance,\nparticularly in payments,\nand some of them\nare now even\nincumbents themselves\nlike Pay Pal and Square\nand Stripe and the like.\nStartups of just 10\nand 20 years ago,\nnow they feel a little bit\nlike incumbents as well.\nBut I think big finance, as\nwe talked earlier with Dani,\nI think big finance,\nwe will still\nhave banks in 10 and\n30 years because there\nis network economics\naround balance sheets.\nAny study of diversification\nwould tell you\nif you have a balance sheet that\nhas thousands of loans on it\nrather than a single loan,\nyou can lower the risk just\nthrough the diversification of\nthe underwriting and the risk\nallocation.\nAlso, big finance has data.\nBut there's challenges\nto big finance\nfor sure from big tech, and\nthe Bank of International\nSettlement talks about big\ntech in terms of data networks\nand activities.\nNow the data is a little\ndifferent than big finance\nbecause it includes data\noutside of the financial world.\nSo they get a picture\non all of our activity\nin a different way.\nGoogle has Google Chrome, it\nhas Google Maps, it has Gmail.\nIt has so many ways\nto assess data.\nPhone companies like Apple have\na lot of sensor data as well.\nThat sensor data is currently\nbeing used in insurance.\nBut will it start to be\nused in credit and payment\nsystems and the like?\nAnd then the startups.\nAnd I don't count\nthe startups out,\nbut I think to think about\nfintech just about startups\nis too narrow, and\nit's why I think\nof fintech around these\nthree sets of actors.\nBut startups,\ndisruptive innovators,\nif you throw up 100 finance\nstartups or fintech startups,\ntwo to five of them are\njust going to break through.\nI mean, there's\nsome odds to this\nthat some will break through.\nAnd they have\nflexibility, and they're\na bit of asymmetric risk takers.\nThey don't have business\nmodels to support and protect.\nAnd often big finance is\nprotecting a business model.\nCredit cards in the\nUS are dominated\nby seven big companies.\nAnd those seven big companies\nthat dominate in the US,\nthey want to protect some\nof their profit and revenue\nmodels.\nAnd so that gives an opportunity\nfor companies like Toast\nto get into the\nrestaurant business.\nIt's a little harder\nfor a big actor\nto go into those individual\nsectors and the like.\nThey also have a bit\nof asymmetric risk\nas it relates to\nregulation, and this is\nwhat Dani was saying earlier.\nIt's neither good nor bad.\nIt's just an observation\nthat startups often\nhave a little bit of an\nattitude as try it out.\nIf it breaks some rules\nsomewhere, clean it up.\nWork in good faith with the\nregulators and the like.\nAnd because they're\nsmaller, often\nregulators around the\nglobe have decided\nto give a little forbearance.\nThere's something called\nregulatory sandboxes\nto promote innovation.\nIf they were larger, there\nwould be more systemic\nand customer-facing problems.\nAnd then fourthly, there's\nthe official sector.\nAnd so while finance, tech, and\nstartups are competing and sort\nof trying to provide\nbetter products and better\nopportunities and\nuser interfaces,\nthe official sector cares\nabout economic growth,\nbut they also care about\nfinancial stability.\nAnd sometimes they're a\nlittle bit in conflict.\nAlso, guarding against illicit\nactivity, promoting inclusion,\nand the tenets of investor\nand consumer protection."],

use machine\nlearning to better allocate\nprice and extend\ncredit or insurance,\nthen you're going to\nuse that technology.\nAnd extracting patterns is\nan important part to do that.\nNow you need to do\nit within the law you\nneed to do it within these\nquestions of fairness\nand explainability.\nBut I think we're going to\nsee this grow dramatically\nby the mid 2020s.\nIt's already there.\nI'm

statistics.\nIt's not as if you have to throw\naway the classic data analysis.\nThis is just a stronger tool\nin certain circumstances\nto add on top of it.\nRomain, questions?\nROMAIN: Let's give\nit

something in place\naround photographs of our\nface that are unique to us\nand so forth.\nSo a handful of\nstates, and so forth.\nI think we're going to\nkeep trying to figure out\nwhat's the right
