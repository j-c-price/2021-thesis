ENDELEMENTPay it Forward Benjamin Franklin, 1784

| do not pretend to give such a deed; | only lend it to you.

When you [...] meet with another honest Man in similar
Distress, you must pay me by lending this Sum to him;
enjoining him to discharge the Debt by a like operation, when
he shall be able, and shall meet with another opportunity.

| hope it may thus go thro' many hands, before it meets with
a Knave that will stop its Progress.

This is a trick of mine for doing a deal of good with a little
money.
