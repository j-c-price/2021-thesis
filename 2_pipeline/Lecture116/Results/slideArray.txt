ENDELEMENTLong-term commitment to new learning and new
philosophy is required of any management that seeks
transformation. The timid and the fainthearted, and
people that expect quick results, are doomed to
disappointment.

ENDELEMENTCREATING A CULTURE OF LEARNING

If we only periodically conduct training events or only episodically work on
improvement -- and the rest of the time it’s business as usual --
then according to neuroscience what we’re actually teaching is business as
usual.

ENDELEMENTWHAT IS A DOJO

Dojos are immersive learning experiences where
full-stack product teams learn new practices and
processes, applying them while delivering real-
world products and services, within the constraints
of their organization.

The Dojo is both a physical space and a way of
learning and practicing.

ENDELEMENTSTART YOUR OWN DOJO SUMMARY

1)Pick a set of practices and learning goals based on the

organizations values and direction to seed your
offerings

2) You don't have to go “all in’ immediately on a physical

Space but get the pilot teams out of their normal
workspace
3) Staff the dojo with your best and brightest. Recognize
experience and mastery

CONTINUOUSLY EXPERIMENT,
LEARN, EVOLVE
ENDELEMENTA PARTING THOUGHT

The greatest waste in America is failure to use the
abilities of its people.
