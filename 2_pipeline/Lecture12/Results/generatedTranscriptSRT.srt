00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
welcome to finntack shaping the future the world of the Nan's and happy spray

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:30,000
may I thought what the heck you've got to be a little in a bed of tray teaching from outdoor as though this is not a virtual background

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
the if the sun is too much for the the birds are too much that's an additional thing remain can give me advice line

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:50,000
not today we're going to drive until insurance and technology or with some call this little sector fintech as insurtech

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:00,000
litter and it's not just simply because the excitement as around payments and Challenger bags in apps like

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Robin hide in the Capital Markets in so for that we leave in short activity and I also think insurtech is an interesting feel that it brings all the peace

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:20,000
gather & somewhere it brings together a part of any ants that has big Legacy and combats in every

8
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:30,000
where there is this handful of life insurance companies in property and casualty insurance that's those that are for

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,000
find some insurance on our homes are Auto sliding so forth healthcare insurers particularly in those countries that have

10
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:50,000
like the US big open healthcare systems insurance companies big Legacy companies have tended to be a

11
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:00,000
behind the curve of Technology compared to the Wall Street firm behind but a little behind and then the insured tickets sell

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:10,000
vintec within and sure sure it's has done some really interesting things particularly around alternative date I wearing a dive into some of these

13
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:20,000
opportunities and also they're there a little bit new forms of alternative date it's not just a better

14
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:30,000
rating it's about our driving it's about our homes it's about thinking about can we underwrite insurance risk

15
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:40,000
related to how we live Our Lives how we drive our cars how small businesses or operated and whether there is more

16
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:50,000
information that can be brought to bear or not just finished inclusion but the pricing and underwriting of risk of course

17
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:00,000
the same trans about artificial intelligence wanna see some really important friends around user interfaces and one of the most interesting areas around us

18
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:10,000
face is what's called claims management in the area that you know hopefully you don't have to think about too much but a Monks this class of 80 or more I'm sure

19
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:20,000
that somebody is had a little fender bender had some scrape up on the road and now that there are apps that you can

20
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:30,000
can your mobile phone take some quick photographs and put it right into the system claims management is changing quite a bit now as

21
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:40,000
startups in the space that basically say we will get you better claims management faster smoother and a better user experience

22
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:50,000
so with that I'm going to try to upload the slides again we can join

23
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:00,000
the community to gather sort of videos or an please raise your hands actively romance going to be watching for any

24
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:10,000
hands up in the chat and if the birds get to be too much just know that I'll go back in on inside on Wednesday

25
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:20,000
how is it so far it's fine it's very nice don't worry me that I can keep having a little bit of

26
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Indulgence here in this beautiful outdoor setting and what I'm going to

27
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Heroes go to the share screens

28
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:50,000
so we're going to talk a little bit ready to start a little bit about the insurance value chain and the sack

29
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:00,000
landscape now and traditionally in business scores traditionally in worlds of fun and finance Majors there's a lot of time

30
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:10,000
banking & Capital Markets and some time but less time spent on insurance

31
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I sell I want to just lay the groundwork a little bit about insurance some of the challenges in the sector itself and then get into this field

32
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:30,000
tac insurance are what are people car insure tech opportunities business models of the startups so that's where the goal of the class the reader

33
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:40,000
we're really about this area of insured tech there were a handful of them the back of international

34
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:50,000
reading was really talking about some of the regulatory challenges and weather in shoretec is well change some of the risk in terms of

35
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:00,000
deleting this space and then a little reading about Asia and if you've not had the opportunity to look at some of the readings because they were just put up last Friday

36
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:10,000
go back it should have died then take her take a little lock and again we'll see if there's anybody wants to give a little fuel in this

37
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:20,000
what are fraternities in the current insurance sector what are the pain points you think that you might want to highlight

38
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:30,000
and then again this is just a little conversation go and so remain here we go

39
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:40,000
you're free thank you for today and felt there is a little pain Point Michael

40
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:50,000
as always Michael is helping herself to get a started go ahead

41
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I think I'm just really kind of underwriting pricing just

42
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:10,000
games a lot of opportunities for automatically baka

43
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:20,000
two sides of processing it's the front end when you're actually trying to get your insurance when you're actually it's caught under a

44
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:30,000
insurance company is pricing and giving you a vulnerability of insurance and whether it's a life insurance where you might have to send some medical test in the like

45
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:40,000
homeowners insurance renters insurance auto insurance where there is a process going on at the front and and and then there's also the price

46
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:50,000
if you have an accident insurance is this product that basically if you never hear from your insurance company and they never hear from you you've paid

47
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:00,000
me to protect you against the rest but the risk is not generated a lost but then you have the accident then you have the prom

48
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:10,000
then you have to send in a claim and that price us and the back and the insurance companies want to protect against fraud they want to fulfill your claim

49
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I want to protect against fraud and the claim adjustment process is a significant time and human and paper based and some time

50
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:30,000
legal based circumstance so Michael Wright pain points at the front and particular paint points in a claims process inside

51
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:40,000
anything else you want to throw it I guess

52
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:50,000
another big is going to be

53
00:08:50,000 --> 00:09:00,000
different type of insurances come to live there is more and more are becoming quantifiable and this is

54
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:10,000
do a number of your bands are things we can get insurance on the selection of things and which we can get shirt it's gone increase dramatically Castell

55
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:20,000
25 of the risks are getting bigger and bigger and sometimes it's not just a new risk in society but it says there's Alexandra saying the quantified

56
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:30,000
let's take auto insurance and a company that started a number of years ago called metromile Simple concept what if we charged ensure

57
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:40,000
is automobile insurance night by the month but maybe by the mile can we quantify that you've only driven a mile and

58
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:50,000
the insurance and if you're a heavy driver there's more and in fact what if the Myall is out in the country roads or it's actually in the sea

59
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:00,000
and where are your driving so quantifiability the analytics the computer paper ability but also the connections to all of us with

60
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:10,000
and the Internet of things give it a little bit of a preview with the rest of the other hand

61
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:20,000
that which we talked about or semester machine learning alternative data influence there put a new factor that we've really not talk

62
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:30,000
about in banking and Challenger bags and Payment Systems is the Internet of things devices possibly changing the field of ensure

63
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Danielle would you like to go

64
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:50,000
connection there's an opportunity for the insurance landscape to be changed by Elton of data in that companies can now inform

65
00:10:50,000 --> 00:11:00,000
with a lot more information on Saturday than they previously had so where is for health insurance or life insurance you might have had to fill out a survey

66
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:10,000
hit by varying degrees of honest on those kinds of service now or suddenly generating an extremely accurate picture of ourselves

67
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:20,000
possibly by everything we do in the world and companies can access that information access network and it's really

68
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:30,000
space is that Justice we said data aggregation important feature in the payment space with companies like clad and Galileo and everything

69
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:40,000
there right there collecting day between the banks and the Payment Systems and then hundreds of thousands of fintech store

70
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:50,000
they're ready to aggregate is in the middle of the day to aggregators in this field as well to collect that data commercialise the data but maybe stay in

71
00:11:50,000 --> 00:12:00,000
when our lives and all the sensors and data collection efforts and hundreds of thousands of store apps on the other side as well

72
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Nikhil this is more specific to the health insurance ID of things where

73
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:20,000
play times in health insurance claim 90% of claims are ordered you located and most of them Basin exits to go methods with the influx of a I like you can review

74
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:30,000
you weren't review in before and she can uncover more fried waste and abuse than you were so this is the market they haven't size yet because they don't know how big

75
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:40,000
my setting is a big trend as well and sometimes it's not truly artificial intelligence for machine learning it's

76
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:50,000
the remarkable ability to collect sore clean up the day to standardise the date of that might also have a beer

77
00:12:50,000 --> 00:13:00,000
machine learning on top of it but it doesn't have to be the machine Laura and I guess it's sort of this partnering up and then what are some of the Chan

78
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:10,000
we're going to talk about some of the challenges for the startups trying to get in there capital regulation and is anybody have a viewers today to the

79
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:20,000
why we haven't seen with some important exceptions but we haven't seen big tech firms getting engaged in the insurance

80
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:30,000
ls7 Port exceptions for talked about in China by the way by why we haven't seen Amazon

81
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:40,000
there in a credit card space in apple in and payment space but why we haven't seen big big tack by Morris

82
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:50,000
yeah I'm so I just think that it's mostly because there's a loaded barrier stand rename be like as you mentioned regulation and also like Alexa

83
00:13:50,000 --> 00:14:00,000
which all of these insurance companies already have so I think it's also regulation and High Courts because of lack of expertise that prevents these attacks on cement

84
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:10,000
insurance market so I think that's right but I'm also going to put out the question throughout the class and as you thought experience at the air

85
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:20,000
is it just that we have in garden area is it possibility that that again big tac is about data networks and act

86
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:30,000
is the back of international Settlements has written Ansell do they want a layer another activity upon that network upon

87
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:40,000
network we haven't quite seen it I said that with one import exception in China and China a number years ago big Tac

88
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Alibaba tension WeChat partnered up with what are the largest insurance companies in China and the three of the

89
00:14:50,000 --> 00:15:00,000
started effectively and insured Tek it's the world's largest insurtech if you we still call it that and it was an arm

90
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:10,000
owned and operated by three big very big companies ping on with the insurance company and

91
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:20,000
so it wasn't direct it was a joint venture but it's a question of will we see this coming into the future or not

92
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:30,000
so let's just sort of dive into the value chain you've got a design a product you've got a market it goes all the way to claims management you can be

93
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:40,000
any one of these pieces this is port from the federal Insurance office of the US Department of Treasury from a report last year

94
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:50,000
each of these pieces might have a piece of car petition and a pain point we talked a little bit of our claims management that claims man

95
00:15:50,000 --> 00:16:00,000
separate insurance from the banking fintech we've talked about what a lot of the underwriting and the front end

96
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:10,000
getting a product in the marketing you'll see that an awful lot of disruption is going on at that Friday marketing is sales

97
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Rugrats it's bringing in the customer it's a better user interface a better user experience in the underwriting and

98
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:30,000
inside you can under a credit you can under 8 insurance it's basically how much insurance will I provide to whom it what price

99
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:40,000
and in that on the riding price house ultimately comes to administering the policy and then the claims management side of it

100
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:50,000
each of these pieces in the value chain might have pain points the front the front for these deciding products to policy administration

101
00:16:50,000 --> 00:17:00,000
actually has a lot overlap with the banking sector not identical important differences so

102
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:10,000
sector look like I just list company is on these several next slides life insurance property and casualty what I want you to take out of

103
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:20,000
protect our names in your country whether it's China live worth metlife for Nippon life in and in Swiss life it's that if you look

104
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:30,000
these companies were founded many or 20th century but many are actually 19th century

105
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:40,000
the concentration and the survival the persistence of insurance companies is quite

106
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:50,000
assisting around the club Victoria about the big 5 and shine up but in any country in any country there's a handful of insurance companies once you get your

107
00:17:50,000 --> 00:18:00,000
top 10 Euro 85 to 90 + percent market share particularly in life insurance and property in cash or take a little less so

108
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:10,000
other fields in this course health and managed care more a feature of the US healthcare system where it's private insurance

109
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:20,000
big diversified companies across the globe diversified simply means that it's both in life and and property and casualty in the law

110
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:30,000
it's Marty line but let's not forget their sorcery insurance and then brokers and the broken side is an aerial

111
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:40,000
disruptors of starter so well maybe we can broker insurance and buy brokering insurance is basically making the sales making the marketing

112
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:50,000
what night taking the risk onto your own balance sheet benefits administration software the only Cup

113
00:18:50,000 --> 00:19:00,000
is there a 21st century companies on this whole sort of review is in the software and services side effects so that's kind of my current

114
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:10,000
you know or apply us insurance premiums just to give you a sense of scale of a market about why did a hair trillion-dollars a year we talk about

115
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Factor that's about 7 trillion in the US I'm sorry 7% of GDP

116
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:30,000
elrow statement there which is about 1/2 million this is consistent with that syzeza the premiums being paid into

117
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:40,000
direct premiums Red Health and life side of things just to give you a little flavour and these will be on canvas of

118
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:50,000
by and large are big part of the life and health side is so savings products there is competition between live companies

119
00:19:50,000 --> 00:20:00,000
and bags live companies and investment management companies on the annuity side the disruption said to speak is been happy

120
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:10,000
largely and property and casualty but to the extent that insured text starts to get into the space I think he will see more more disruption in the saving

121
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:20,000
excited as well the companies like betterment and all those companies we talked about in the wealth management side or and wealth Tak I think

122
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:30,000
c starting to say wait maybe we can get into the annuity side as well the annuity and saving side of life insurance products

123
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Property & casualty just a little break down here in the US and so now we turned the challenges pain

124
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:50,000
what are we have this is true of any and company company you could be a cup of tea that's been in business for 100 + years and you're you're sitting there going

125
00:20:50,000 --> 00:21:00,000
selling through an agent or broker network and the agency and brokerage now work here in the US takes a big

126
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I think on a property casually said we're probably in the 10 to 13% of a premium

127
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:20,000
average but in some products it's much larger so I'm a little smaller the life side the premiums I think her and hi Singleton

128
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:30,000
The Temper sent on average in while I'm not sort of an expert of all the that's basically means of you pay a

129
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:40,000
thousand dollars for your auto insurance 100plus dollars $120 is being taken by those agents in progress

130
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:50,000
claims administration we talked about it very paper and human and chance of litigation risk all about and insurance companies are built

131
00:21:50,000 --> 00:22:00,000
around this Legacy Tak just like an Indian payments and in credit

132
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:10,000
every dollar a premium a big chunk is not only going to the agents in the brokers but a big chunk as of going of course to the whole claims

133
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:20,000
the whole value chain and because it's deeply regulated in many marketplaces you can offer a new type of

134
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:30,000
parents without getting some official sector approval going through the product design face often has

135
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Legacy and time delays within it and of course just like the other Fields there's a whole sort of questions about user-interface and user experience

136
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:50,000
all of these present challenges but they also present opportunities remain any questions not yet but that's sweet rose City seconds

137
00:22:50,000 --> 00:23:00,000
no I don't see hands up tomorrow

138
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:10,000
so insurance and insurance tech you can sort of say I want to be involved in the pricing and underwriting the

139
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:20,000
the policy administration the claims management survey for different sectors improving the customer engagement lowering operating cost

140
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:30,000
of course it always goes back to can you do something better quicker cheaper but as we talked about earlier it could be in product design

141
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:40,000
wow it could be in in notches doing a cheaper and pricing got more availability and his metromile is died really in

142
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:50,000
using metrics to get to a new type of product itself in the quoting and issuing a products

143
00:23:50,000 --> 00:24:00,000
what are some of the opportunities more specifically I think across finacial technology it's about user-interface and user

144
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:10,000
experience so that could be in the southside it can be in the account management digital a mobile phones but also in the conversation interface

145
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:20,000
underwriting we've talked about it really not just the machine learning but the alternative data and then clear

146
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I think these are the big three they seem pretty simple once I say it but it should have like thinking about it

147
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:40,000
if you have a business smart or if you're going into this business or you're at Prudential life insurance are Nippon life it's sort of saying how can we use techno

148
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:50,000
to enhance user experience how can we enhance basically the pricing and availability of our product underwriting how do we

149
00:24:50,000 --> 00:25:00,000
back at the first two user experience in underwriting very much true and banking tac claims processing somewhere tuna

150
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:10,000
and it's about data capture now one port of the day to capture and you can see it

151
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:20,000
drones the Internet of things smartphones telematics wearables I am curious

152
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:30,000
see if anyone will raise their hand is there anybody actually taken insurance where the insurance company is sad for your automobile

153
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:40,000
we want to have access to your driving record directly through your car's telematics telematics is a word that didn't exist 30 and 50

154
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:50,000
it's really or if it did exist it wasn't commonly used it's about all the information

155
00:25:50,000 --> 00:26:00,000
if your car's collecting I'm driving in the computers onboard your your car

156
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Nitrous GPS Anakin service as you're driving smartphones as well can assess her driving

157
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:20,000
smart furniture not just locational devices but they can get all of us the ups and downs of your driving what is that mean

158
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:30,000
smartphones and the computers on our cars a product can be offered it says we no

159
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:40,000
about your driving that we will give you fine tune pricing and underwriting

160
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:50,000
should around the round Google deal with ascension to store and analyse the medical records from the hospital network and I'm curious

161
00:26:50,000 --> 00:27:00,000
think that kind of entrance the big pack into the medical world is going to be more common in about might be a potential Avenue for those kinds of companies get

162
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:10,000
insight into health data that they would need to make them competent to move into insurance

163
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Victor can be very influential particularly the big AI companies like Google and video in China to the extent

164
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:30,000
and we'll see there are some startups that are entering this field because they're very good day datalytics in machine

165
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:40,000
to the extent that they can be dead aggregators like Google you're actually right I don't think it's just healthcare by the way but I think healthcare is a really

166
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:50,000
you submit that many insurance companies healthcare management companies in the US have a tremendous amount of date and they want

167
00:27:50,000 --> 00:28:00,000
and I want to with that data provide more fine tune insurance products but also help manager healthcare system

168
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:10,000
better so I think it isn't happening for certain big tech companies that are at the cutting edge of of data Analytics and machine learning

169
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:20,000
my for every big tech company but I agree with that you did anybody have insurance

170
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:30,000
insurance think probably Alessandro he had his hand up but probably a question

171
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:40,000
add this little or a computer I'm bored and physically

172
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:50,000
treat everything that I do with a car wreck where it where are you but I was how many miles I drove everything can actually eat up for help me

173
00:28:50,000 --> 00:29:00,000
decrease the cost of insurance some of the first telematics patterns filed

174
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:10,000
intelematics were in the late 1990s what we found it's really changed the field of autoit sure

175
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:20,000
this little visualisation about ensure attack again from the department of Treasury study last four I think it's just a good place to surpass for

176
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:30,000
we're not going to go through every box but whether it's sensors and telematics and this is a big piece of having those

177
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:40,000
intelematics there to lower Alexandros cost of insurance but also for claims management if the telematics and sensors are

178
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:50,000
upon an accident then you can lower a little bit the cost of claims management and the insurance companies can have

179
00:29:50,000 --> 00:30:00,000
the accident actually happened potentially figure out who's at fault see right at that moment

180
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:10,000
play 9 and that automobile visual computing literally downloading uploading photographs into the claims

181
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:20,000
process we've already talked about machine learning AI but blockchain technology want to touch a pod of all the fields of blockchain Technology that

182
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:30,000
generally have heard about in many of them are hyper-reality field is weather with the use of

183
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:40,000
blockchain technology that we can have an ape and only law that is Tampa resisted whether there would be trust

184
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:50,000
the art of insurance card parametric insurance in essence if we had an automated smart contract that says

185
00:30:50,000 --> 00:31:00,000
this happens I get paid so what's the best one Field Group of students started last year studying it

186
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:10,000
hair for a group in Asia was parametric insurance for airline delays if you couldn't

187
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:20,000
on tape resistant larger on at Ledger you would embed smart contracts it says if the play

188
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:30,000
takes off more than a half hour late you automatically get paid a mobile app no trying to rely

189
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Caroline's whether they're accurately telling you are not that they plan to go off late put it on a blockchain technology now maybe you could do it with a scent

190
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:50,000
your base as well but there are many people looking at whether to use blockchain technology for parametric insurance but the sensor is intelematics the visual computing the

191
00:31:50,000 --> 00:32:00,000
that was a real Department of Treasury so the boss of put something only on the edge in terms of blockchain Technology

192
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:10,000
about 4 ensure attack is still the age of Challenger funding and it's it's particularly true in insurance because

193
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:20,000
take an insurance risk winder your balance sheet that's a liability of an insurance company that's a liability that in the future they have to payout

194
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Acclaim line an accident a loss on your home or on your life so many companies

195
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:40,000
fighting shower Jess if they're startups how can I access capital on the banking sector you can possibly do it through security

196
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:50,000
you can basically say I'm not gonna I'm not going to be on my own bow and she I'm gonna suit a renter bow and she I'm gonna lay it off

197
00:32:50,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Cimorelli here you can lay off some rest in the reassurance markets but it's not quite the same for these insurtech startups

198
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:10,000
most Challenger bags partner with some Bank data warehouse line of credit and possibly also

199
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:20,000
then sell their loans after their initiated here it's not as real boss it's not as developed but again

200
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:30,000
insurance fintech startups for saying do I partner with a big diamond and insurance company because I can't build my balance sheet as

201
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:40,000
if you choose to be a carrier in a carrier is the term to say to actually take the insurance under your balance sheet you have the liability choose to be

202
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:50,000
it's balance sheet intensive just how do you find your startup run weight loss because all the stored us tender have mods

203
00:33:50,000 --> 00:34:00,000
of building out a network in building the platform itself clearly the competitive landscape the regulatory frameworks

204
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:10,000
regulatory frameworks do you get licenced again similar is Challenger Banks remember we talked about these neobanks and Challenger Bank switch off DP

205
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:20,000
in the same breath of the same but more specifically a neobank is something doing a lot of banking functions that is not yet got no backing

206
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:30,000
similar here if you're thinking about starting an insurance fintech for what type of licensing will you get was just be a brokerage licence

207
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:40,000
in various jurisdictions you have to register to be a broker or an agent or you actually registering to take lives on your balance sheet become a carrier

208
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:50,000
and then of course user adoption and the use of data and it hurts to the use of data there are quite the

209
00:34:50,000 --> 00:35:00,000
it doesn't we have the same conceptual framework that you have to be fair and unbiased but there are quite the same lost like the equal credit after

210
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:10,000
the actor here in the US and it's the use of data as will see it a minute if you sign a waiver and say you can use my driving record

211
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:20,000
insurance is Alexandra did they can use that day at also on the claims management side it's not just a lower the cost

212
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:30,000
to see if you call up and say an accident they look at the tell about exits a did this really happened so the insured

213
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:40,000
landscape when I can dive into the slide but it's just each of these pieces each of these pieces it might be the church trying to go into the building and payments

214
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:50,000
which is rudimentary sort of you could be going all the way to another area and say we're going to be the best date and letter

215
00:35:50,000 --> 00:36:00,000
wearables wearables how many people have a Fitbit anybody want to talk about whether you've signed up for insurance

216
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:10,000
that your insurance company can get your data off with your Fitbit HR off of your Apple watch off your off you know what you're using for

217
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:20,000
or exercise can lower your cost of insurance on a pause remain and don't see any hands up

218
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:30,000
NZ Street with the insurance but what I did have is at my former employer

219
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:40,000
program where we would connect or tracking devices like 4 steps and stuff with this program that like would give you

220
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:50,000
have you got so many steps a day so I get tons of gift cards because of all the steps I tracked in and that that I'm sure I was

221
00:36:50,000 --> 00:37:00,000
the internet something you got to your 10,000steps or maybe they gave you a preview for 5000 steps you got

222
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:10,000
is Uber rewards that we all know about rewards programs in credit cards and that's part of that two and three quarter

223
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:20,000
interchange there's these rewards by your employer ultimately the economic incentives is the employer can have lower cost of Health and

224
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:30,000
that data through the inner mediation of your employment contract was lower and health insurance course for some group

225
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:40,000
insured I think your employer is also doing it because they know if you're better health it you are so few more days off you'll be you'll be so hopefully

226
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:50,000
better employee so there are so lowering some of their their course in terms of their direct course but it also relates to help ensure

227
00:37:50,000 --> 00:38:00,000
so wearables trackables telematics and the internet of thing the internet of thing is a term

228
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:10,000
about senses and it's about senses in many items in our home as well if you have a home

229
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:20,000
security system in the last 5 or 10 years you've got it able to tie that into more data

230
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:30,000
security systems have four decades somehow had to communicate through a security company to lawn for us men if the

231
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:40,000
alarm went off but I'm talking about more flying to monitoring and we all aware even know that very few of us might have it that you can

232
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:50,000
apps on your phone that you can communicate with your home to turn on your heat for your air

233
00:38:50,000 --> 00:39:00,000
monitor your home home monitoring devices that makes all of us maybe more comfortable than our home is secure

234
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:10,000
or even to have the communication from the home if for some reason there is a problem in the harm

235
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Sanchez on refrigerators for sensors on HVAC heating and ventilation systems their census Road houses

236
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I need to see this just absolutely mushroom it's Arms of such is so what's that day to do for the insurance field that's why I think insurtech and

237
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:40,000
in pentakis such an exciting and interesting place because we are basically in a transformational time right now in terms of sensor

238
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:50,000
no i g and embedding sensors into our economies not because of insurance but because many

239
00:39:50,000 --> 00:40:00,000
uses one as sort of monitor either their home their automobile the wearable the trackable and now

240
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:10,000
with this this really challenging time around the Corona virus crisis we talking about contact tracing

241
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:20,000
call back contact racing could also be Fatty and depending upon the jurisdiction depending on the regulation into

242
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:30,000
insurance rates life insurance rates or any form of insurance again largely dependent upon

243
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:40,000
where is jurisdictions regulatory and legal frameworks so what are some of the possibilities you can become

244
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:50,000
ensure that means actually committing bow and she becoming licence taking claims on as a liability managing the assets

245
00:40:50,000 --> 00:41:00,000
you can be a man it's generally jitt think broker it's just a term to say you could be managing agent or broker

246
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:10,000
who sells those ricotta the two big divide but you could just be on the technology side or the day to aggregation site these would have various

247
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:20,000
or insurtech startups we won't get through each one of them to see a common thing and there's less is

248
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:30,000
by and large or founded in the 2010s so this is 5 or 10 years of dynamic change

249
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:40,000
you're going to see heavy emphasis or homeowners in Autos so it's in the consumer space very similar to

250
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:50,000
credit you see a little bit moving into small business but not Lords commercial lines though both penguin is a commercial

251
00:41:50,000 --> 00:42:00,000
exchange a lot is on the front and on the auto side you also get Marketplace comparisons just like in the credit space

252
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:10,000
it's basically Expedia for auto insurance so to speak you could say your Expedia for fill in the blank insurance these were the

253
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:20,000
please comparisons like cover hand and goji

254
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:30,000
throughout your see home and auto small business is kind of the dominant how many is there anybody use the product lemonade for rent

255
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:40,000
insurance

256
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:50,000
so lemonade Garden of the field basically to say it's so many people pretty clear the us or renting

257
00:42:50,000 --> 00:43:00,000
we just watch some insurance for objects that are things in our homes and in case there's a problem or maybe the landlord says you

258
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:10,000
dad renters insurance policy bizarre bizarre about

259
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:20,000
years old one of the largest Marketplace comparison in India remarkable platform again

260
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:30,000
broadly speaking Expedia for health and life insurance you know where you can price compare policybazaar

261
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:40,000
of these various companies just pies a bit or route uses telematics to price the products honest everyone

262
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Auto companies when here are using telematics and smartphone some of them started on telematics some store read more in this more

263
00:43:50,000 --> 00:44:00,000
but the merger of those to the art of the oldest Bell claims management just slowly

264
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:10,000
focusing there and I said I was going to mention about China the last on this less than I probably will mispronounce how to say it song on

265
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:20,000
which formed by three very large companies online China

266
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:30,000
it's gone public since it's a very significant company in China it's the only online insurance

267
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:40,000
licensing in China so it shows the licensing it had the backing of 3 very large company 7 years ago it got said licence

268
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:50,000
and it has a certain advantage that to my knowledge I don't think anybody else has been there so gives you some of the smarter and I'm gonna pores

269
00:44:50,000 --> 00:45:00,000
you see if there's any questions regret I think

270
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:10,000
healthcare healthcare finntack ID still call ensure attack some people can call healthtec this is the

271
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:20,000
laurenzside and how technology is coming and disrupt again you could be an any piece of this

272
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:30,000
shower from FTP partner's but you could be in any piece of the answer when you do the payment side I mean

273
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:40,000
lamb side and would it be in benefits management but any piece of that and so any again most of these are in the US but not

274
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:50,000
just some of what were say American well is about telehealth the very important thing now that were in in a period of time that we can

294
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:10,000
0 Dida aggregators that are collecting telematic dater they're not alone and then with that day to come

297
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:40,000
about some of its like around the mid mid chest it range but if they will wear a sensor

you can lower the cost of workplace insurance you can also hopefully make the workplace safer so they're selling a safe

307
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:20,000
claim settlement down to less than minutes and I think there was one claim that was settled in seconds it was an order

00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:30,000
it was something that could do quite quickly check the logically but I also think that it was a bit of them a marketing thing that they wanted to say you could get claims

309
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:40,000
countdown 2 minutes so that's a little bit of review
