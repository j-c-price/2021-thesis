{"0": [0, 290, "[RUSTLING]\n[CLICKING]\nGARY GENSLER:\nWelcome to FinTech--\nShaping the Future of\nThe World of Finance.\nAnd happy spring.\nIt's May.\nI thought what the heck?\nYou've got to be a\nlittle innovative.\nTry teaching from outdoor.\nSo this is not a\nvirtual backdrop.\nIf the sun is too much or\nthe birds are too much,\nthat's an additional thing\nRomain can give me advice on.\nNow today we're going to dive\ninto insurance and technology\nor what some call this little\nsector of fintech as insurtech.\nBut it's not so\nlittle, it's not just\nsimply because the excitement is\naround payments and challenger\nbanks and apps like Robinhood\nand the capital markets\nand so forth that we leave\ninsurtech to the end.\nI also think insurtech\nis an interesting field\nthat it brings all the\npieces together in some way.\nIt brings together\na part of finance\nthat has big legacy incumbents.\nIn every country\nwe're in, there is\nthis handful of life-insurance\ncompanies and property\nand casualty insurance--\nthat's those that offer lines\nof insurance on our homes,\nour autos, and so forth;\nhealth-care insurers,\nparticularly\nin those countries that\nhave, like the US, big,\nopen health-care systems.\nThese insurance companies,\nbig, legacy companies,\nhave tended to be a little\nbehind the curve of technology\ncompared to the\nWall Street firms--\nnot a lot behind\nbut a little behind.\nAnd then the insurtech itself,\nthe fintech within insurance,\nhas done some really\ninteresting things particularly\naround alternative data, and\nwe're going to dive into some\nof these opportunities.\nAnd also they're a little bit\nnew forms of alternative data.\nIt's not just about\nour credit weighting.\nIt's about our driving.\nIt's about our homes.\nIt's about thinking about can\nwe underwrite insurance risk\nrelated to how we live our\nlives, how we drive our cars,\nhow small businesses\nare operated,\nand whether there's more\ninformation that can be brought\nto bear or not just financial\ninclusion but the pricing\nand underwriting of risk?\nOf course, we're going\nto see the same trends\nabout artificial intelligence.\nWe're going to see some really\nimportant trends around user\ninterfaces.\nAnd one of the most interesting\nareas around user interfaces\nis what's called\nclaims management,\nan area that hopefully you don't\nhave to think about too much.\nBut amongst this\nclass of 80 or more,\nI'm sure that somebody has had\na little fender bender, had\nsome scrape up on the roads.\nAnd now that there are\napps that you can just,\non your mobile phone, take\nsome quick photographs\nand put it right\ninto the system.\nClaims management is changing\nquite a bit now as well,\nand there's startups in\nthis space that basically\nsay we will get you better\nclaims management faster,\nsmoother, and a better user\nexperience about claims\nmanagement.\nSo with that, I'm going to try\nto upload the slides again.\nWe can join sort\nof the community\ntogether, sort of videos on.\nPlease raise your\nhands actively.\nRomain's going to be watching\nfor any blue hands up\nalso in the chat.\nAnd if the birds\nget to be too much,\njust know that I'll go\nback inside on Wednesday.\nRomain, how is it so far?\nTEACHING ASSISTANT: It's fine.\nIt's very nice.\nDon't worry.\nGARY GENSLER: All right.\nHe's assuring me that\nI can keep having\na little bit of\nan indulgence here\nin this beautiful\noutdoor setting.\nAnd what I'm going to need to\ndo is go to this Share Screens.\nSo we're going to talk\na little bit-- we're\ngoing to start a little bit\nabout the insurance value"], "290": [1, 40, "And traditionally\nin business schools,\ntraditionally in worlds of\nfinance and finance majors,\nthere's a lot of time spent on\nbanking and on capital markets,\nand there's some time but\nless time spent on insurance.\nAnd so I'm going to just lay\nthe groundwork a little bit\nabout insurance, some\nof the challenges\nin the sector itself, and\nthen get into this field\nfintech and insurance\nor what a lot of people\ncall insurtech, opportunities,\nbusiness models,\nand the startups.\nSo that's sort of the\ngoal of the class."], "330": [2, 40, "There was a handful of them.\nThe Bank of\nInternational Settlement\nreading was really\ntalking about some\nof the regulatory challenges\nand whether insurtech\nwill change some of the risks in\nterms of regulating this space.\nAnd then a little\nreading about Asia.\nAnd if you've not had\nthe opportunity to look\nat some of the readings\nbecause they were just put up\nlast Friday, go back.\nSort of dive.\nTake a little look.\nAnd again, we'll\nsee if anybody wants"], "370": [3, 550, "but what opportunities in the\ncurrent insurance sector--\nor what are the pain\npoints, you think,\nthat you might\nwant to highlight?\nAnd again, this is just to\nget a little conversation go.\nSo Romain?\nTEACHING ASSISTANT:\nOK, here we go.\nWho will be our first\nvolunteer for today?\nGARY GENSLER: Has anybody\never had insurance and felt\nthere was a little pain point?\nMichael, I see a hand up.\nTEACHING ASSISTANT:\nAs always, Michael\nis helping us out\nto get us started.\nGo ahead.\nAUDIENCE: I think one\nof the obvious ones\nis just processing time.\nIt's just really kind\nof through each step\nof the process, underwriting--\nI don't know-- processing,\ncompleting, [INAUDIBLE],,\nit just takes a long time.\nSo kind of there's\ndefinitely a lot\nof opportunities for automatic\nfeedback or leveraging AI\nto really speed that\nup for consumers.\nGARY GENSLER: So the two sides\nof processing-- it's the front\nand when you're actually\ntrying to get your insurance,\nwhen you're actually--\nit's called underwriting.\nThe insurance company is\npricing and giving you\navailability of insurance.\nAnd whether it's\nlife insurance where\nyou might have to send\nin some medical tests\nand the like,\nhomeowners insurance,\nrenters insurance,\nauto insurance\nwhere there's a process\ngoing on at the front end.\nAnd then there's\nalso the process\nif you have an accident.\nInsurance is this product\nthat basically if you never\nhear from your insurance company\nand they never hear from you,\nyou've paid a premium to\nprotect you against a risk,\nbut the risk has not\ngenerated a loss.\nBut then you have the accident.\nThen you have the problem.\nThen you have to\nsend in a claim.\nAnd that process\non the back end,\nthe insurance companies want\nto protect against fraud.\nThey want to fulfill\nyour claim, but they\nwant to protect\nagainst fraud, and\nthe claim-adjustment process\nis a significant time\nand human and paper-based\nand sometimes legal-based\ncircumstance.\nSo, Michael, you're right.\nPain points at the front\nend, particular pain points\nin the claims-processing side.\nAnything else you\nwant to throw in?\nAUDIENCE: I guess--\nGARY GENSLER: Oh, we've got a\nfew other hands if you want.\nI mean if you want to--\nAUDIENCE: That's fine.\nI can pass it off\nto somebody else.\nTEACHING ASSISTANT: Alessandro?\nAUDIENCE: Yeah, I\nthink another big trend\nis we're going to see\ndifferent type of insurances\ncome to life as more and\nmore risks are becoming\nquantifiable.\nAnd this leads to a\nnumber of events or things\nwe can get insurance on.\nSo the selection of things\non which we can get insured\nis going to increase\ndramatically\nbecause the quantifiable risks\nare getting bigger and bigger.\nGARY GENSLER: Right.\nAnd sometimes it's not\njust a new risk in society\nbut it's, as Alexandro is\nsaying, the quantifiability\nof it.\nSo let's take auto\ninsurance and a company that\nstarted a number of years\nago called Metromile.\nSimple concept-- what if we\ncharged automobile insurance\nnot by the month but\nmaybe by the mile?\nCould we quantify that\nyou've only driven a mile\nand that would be the insurance?\nAnd if you're a heavy\ndriver, there's more.\nAnd, in fact, what if the\nmile is out on the country\nroads or it's\nactually in the cities\nand where you're driving?\nSo quantifiability, the\nanalytics, the computer\ncapability, but also the\nconnections to all of us\nwith sensors and the\ninternet of things.\nSo I've sort of given a\nlittle bit of a preview,\nbut there were some\nother hands up.\nHow have that which we've\ntalked about all semester--\nmachine learning,\nalternative data--\ninfluenced this?\nBut a new factor that\nwe've really not talked\nmuch about in banking and\nchallenger banks and payment\nsystems is the\ninternet-of-things devices\npossibly changing the\nfield of insurance.\nTEACHING ASSISTANT: Danielle,\nwould you like to go.\nAUDIENCE: Sure.\nAnd also you just broke up\nthere, so if you lose me,\nsorry about my\ninternet connection.\nSo there's an opportunity\nfor the insurance landscape\nto be changed by alternative\ndata in that companies can now\ninform their underwriting\nprocess with a lot\nmore information, a\nlot richer set of data\nthan they previously had.\nSo whereas for health\ninsurance or life insurance\nyou might have had to\nfill out a survey--\npeople are varying\ndegrees of honest on those\nkinds of surveys.\nNow we're suddenly generating\nan extremely accurate picture\nof ourselves almost passively by\neverything we do in the world,\nand companies can\naccess that information.\nGARY GENSLER: Right,\nor can they access it?\nThey still have\nto have a network.\nAnd what's really\ninteresting in this space\nis that just as we\nsaw a data aggregation\nan important feature in the\npayment space with companies\nlike Plaid and\nGalileo and everything\nthat they were right\nthere collecting\ndata between the banks\nand the payment systems\nand then hundreds or\nthousands of fintech startups,\nthat there were data\naggregators in the middle,\nthere are data\naggregators in this field\nas well to collect that\ndata, commercialize the data,\nbut maybe stand between\nour lives and all\nthe sensors and\ndata-collection efforts\nand hundreds or thousands of\nstartups on the other side\nas well.\nTEACHING ASSISTANT: Nikhil?\nAUDIENCE: Sure.\nI think this is more specific\nto the health-insurance side\nof things where a lot\nof times in health\ninsurance, 90% of claims\nare auto adjudicated,\nand most of them are based\non statistical methods.\nWith the influx of AI,\nyou can review claims\nthat you weren't\nreviewing before,\nand so you could potentially\nuncover more fraud, waste,\nand abuse than you were.\nSo this is a market that\nthey haven't sized yet\nbecause they don't know\nhow big fraud might be.\nSo I think there's a\nbig trend there as well.\nGARY GENSLER: Great point.\nAnd sometimes it's not truly\nartificial intelligence\nor machine learning.\nIt's just the remarkable ability\nto collect, sort, clean up\nthe data, standardize\nthe data that might also\nhave a bit of machine\nlearning on top of it,\nbut it doesn't have to\nbe the machine learning.\nIt's sort of this partnering up.\nAnd then what are some\nof the challenges?\nWe're going to talk about\nsome of the challenges\nfor the startups trying to get\nin there-- capital, regulation.\nAnd does anybody have a\nview as to the date why\nwe haven't seen--\nwith some important\nexceptions, but we\nhaven't seen big\ntech firms getting\nengaged in the insurance field.\nNow, there's some\nimportant exceptions\nwe'll talk about in\nChina, by the way,\nbut why we haven't seen Amazon--\nthey're in the credit-card\nspace-- and Apple\nin payment space but why\nwe haven't seen big tech,\nby and large.\nTEACHING ASSISTANT: Laira?\nAUDIENCE: Yeah, so I just\nthink that it's mostly\nbecause there's a lot\nof barriers to entry,\nnamely as you mentioned,\nregulation and also\nlack of expertise, which all\nof these insurance companies\nalready have.\nSo I think it's also regulation\nand high costs because of lack\nof expertise that prevents these\nbig tech firms from entering\ninto the insurance market.\nGARY GENSLER: All right, so\nI think that's partly right,\nbut I'm also going to\nput out the question\nthroughout the class and a\nthought experience at the end,\nis it just that we\nhaven't gotten there yet?\nIs it a possibility that--\nagain, big tech is about data,\nnetworks, and activities,\nas the Bank of International\nSettlement has written.\nAnd so do they want to\nlayer another activity\nupon that network--\nupon that network?\nWe haven't quite seen it.\nI said that with one\nimportant exception in China.\nIn China a number of\nyears ago, big tech--\nAlibaba, Tencent\nthat has WeChat--\npartnered up with one\nof the largest insurance\ncompanies in China,\nand the three of them\nstarted effectively\nan insurtech.\nIt's the world's\nlargest insurtech\nif we still call it that,\nand it was owned and operated\nby three very big companies.\nPing An was the\ninsurance company.\nAnd so it wasn't direct.\nIt was a joint venture.\nBut it's a question\nof will we see this"], "920": [4, 100, "So let's just sort of\ndive into the value chain.\nYou've got to design a product.\nYou've got to market it.\nIt goes all the way\nto claims management.\nYou can be in any\none of these pieces.\nThis is just pulled from\nthe Federal Insurance\nOffice of the US Department\nof Treasury from a report\nlast year.\nBut each of these pieces might\nhave a piece of competition\nand a pain point.\nWe talked a little bit\nabout claims management.\nClaims management\nseparates insurance\nfrom the banking\nfintech we've talked\nabout, but a lot\nof the underwriting\nand the front end--\ndesigning a product\nand the marketing--\nyou'll see that an\nawful lot of disruption\nis going on at that front end.\nMarketing is sales.\nIt's brokerage.\nIt's bringing in the customer.\nIt's a better user interface,\na better user experience.\nIn the underwriting\nand rating side,\nyou can underwrite credit.\nYou can underwrite insurance.\nIt's basically how\nmuch insurance will\nI provide to whom at what price?\nAnd that underwriting\nprocess ultimately\ncomes to administering the\npolicy and then the claims\nmanagement side of it.\nSo each of these pieces\nof the value chain\nmight have pain points.\nThe front four of these,\ndesigning products\nto policy administration,\nactually has a lot of overlap\nwith the banking sector--\nnot identical.\nImportant differences."], "1020": [5, 60, "I just list companies on\nthese several next slides--\nlife insurance,\nproperty, casualty.\nWhat I want you to take out\nof is not particular names\nin your country, whether it's\nChina Life or MetLife or Nippon\nLife and Swiss Life.\nIt's that if you look at when\nthese companies were founded,\nmany are 20th century, but\nmany are actually 19th century.\nThe concentration\nand the survival\nthe persistence of\ninsurance companies\nis quite consistent\naround the globe.\nThey talk about the big five\nin China, but in any country--\nin any country there's a\nhandful of insurance companies.\nOnce you get to about the\ntop 10, you're at 85%

disruption\nin the savings-products\nside as well.\nThe companies like Betterment\nand all those companies\nwe talked about in the\nwealth-management side\nor in wealthtech I think you\nwill see starting to say, wait.\nMaybe we can get\ninto the annuity side\nas well, the annuity\nand savings side\nof life-insurance products."], "1230": [10, 10, "here in the US."], "1240": [11, 140, "What do

broker\nnetwork.\nAnd the agency and brokerage\nnetwork here in the US\ntakes a big chunk of fees.\nI think on the\nproperty/casualty side,\nwe're probably in the 10% to\n13% of premiums on average.\nBut in some products, it's much\nlarger, some a little smaller.\nThe life side, the premiums I\nthink are in high single digits\nto 10% on average.\nAnd while I'm not sort of an\nexpert of all the fee, that\nbasically means if you pay\n$1,000 for your auto insurance,\n$100 plus, $120 is being taken\nby those agents and brokers.\nClaims administration,\nwe talked about it.\nVery paper

marketplaces\nyou can't offer a\nnew type of insurance\nwithout getting some\nofficial sector approval.\nGoing through the\nproduct-design phase\noften has legacy and\ntime delays within it.\nAnd, of course, just\nlike the other fields,\nthere's whole sorts of questions\nabout user interface and user\nexperience.\nAll of these present\nchallenges, but they also\npresent opportunities.\nRomain, any questions?\nTEACHING ASSISTANT:\nNot yet, but let's\nwait perhaps a few seconds.\nNo, I don't see any hands up.\nGARY GENSLER: All right."], "1380": [12, 50, "So insurance and\ninsurance tech--\nyou

well.\nIt could be in not just\ndoing it cheaper in pricing\nbut more availability and,\nas Metromile has done, really\nin using metrics to get\nto a new type of product\nitself and the quoting\nand issuing of products."], "1430": [13, 320, "more specifically?\nI think across\nfinancial technology,\nit's about user interface\nand user experience.\nSo that could be\non the sales side.\nIt can be in the\naccount management,\ndigital and mobile\nphones, but also\nin the conversational interface.\nUnderwriting, we've talked\nabout it, really not just\nthe machine learning but\nthe alternative data,\nand then claims processing.\nI think these are the big three.\nThey seem pretty\nsimple once I say it.\nBut it's sort of like\nthinking about it,\nand if you have\na business model,\nif you're going\ninto this business\nor you're at Prudential\nLife Insurance or Nippon\nLife, it's sort of saying,\nhow can we use technology\nto enhance user experience?\nHow can we enhance basically\nthe pricing and the availability\nof our product underwriting?\nHow do we do the back end?\nThe first two, user\nexperience and underwriting,\nvery much true in banking tech.\nClaims processing,\nsomewhat unique here.\nAnd it's about data capture.\nNow, one part of\nthe data capture--\nand you can see it here--\ndrones, the internet of things,\nsmartphones, telematics,\nwearables.\nI'm curious-- Romain,\nyou'll see if anyone\nwill raise their hand.\nHas anybody actually\ntaken insurance\nwhere the insurance company\nhas said for your automobile,\nwe want to have access\nto your driving record\ndirectly through your\ncar's telematics?\nTelematics is a word that didn't\nexist 30 and 50 years ago,\nor if it did exist, it\nwasn't commonly used.\nIt's about all the information\nthat your car is collecting\non driving in the computers\non board your car,\nand it's not just GPS.\nAnd it can sort of\nassess your driving.\nSmartphones as well can assess\nour driving because smartphones\nare not just locational devices,\nbut they can get all the ups\nand downs of your driving.\nWhat does that mean?\nThat between smartphones\nand the computers\non our cars, a\nproduct can be offered\nthat says we know enough\nabout your driving\nthat we will give you fine-tuned\npricing and underwriting.\nTEACHING ASSISTANT: Danielle?\nGARY GENSLER: Romain?\nAUDIENCE: Yeah, I had a\nquestion around Google's deal\nwith Ascension to store and\nanalyze the medical records\nfrom their hospital network.\nAnd I'm curious if you\nthink that kind of entrance,\nthe big tech into\nthe medical world,\nis going to be more\ncommon and if that might\nbe a potential avenue for those\nkinds of companies getting\nthe insight into\nhealth data that they\nwould need to make\nthem confident to move\ninto insurance?\nGARY GENSLER: I\nthink you've landed\nupon one area that big tech\ncan be very influential,\nparticularly the big AI\ncompanies like Google and Baidu\nin China, to the extent--\nand we'll see there\nare some startups that\nare entering this field because\nthey're very good at data\nanalytics and machine learning.\nAnd to the extent\nthat they can be\ndata aggregators like Google,\nyou're absolutely right.\nI don't think it's just\nhealth care, by the way,\nbut I think health care is a\nreally important piece of it,\nthat many insurance companies,\nhealth-care management\ncompanies in the US have a\ntremendous amount of data,\nand they want to make\nmore sense of it.\nAnd they want to,\nwith that data,\nprovide more fine-tuned\ninsurance products\nbut also help manage our\nhealth-care system better.\nSo I think it is an avenue for\ncertain big tech companies that\nare at the cutting edge of data\nanalytics and machine learning.\nNot for every big tech company\nbut for many I agree with that.\nDid anybody have an insurance--\ndid anybody take out\nan auto insurance?\nTEACHING ASSISTANT: I\nthink probably Alessandro.\nHe had his hand up but\nprobably for a question.\nAUDIENCE: I had this little\nchip or a computer on board.\nAnd basically, yeah,\nit traced everything\nthat I did with the car, like\nwhere I was, how many miles I\ndrove, everything.\nAnd it actually helped me to\ndecrease the cost of insurance.\nGARY GENSLER: There you go.\nThere you go.\nNow, some of the first\npatents filed on telematics\nwere in the late 1990s.\nBut what we found is\nit's really changed"], "1750": [14, 170, "This little visualization\nabout insurtech,\nagain from the Department\nof Treasury study

sensors\nand telematics there to lower\nAlexandro's cost of insurance\nbut also for claims management.\nIf the telematics and sensors\nare there upon an accident,\nthen you can lower a little bit\nthe

an\nautomated smart contract\nthat said that if this\nhappens, I get paid.\nSo what's the this?\nOne field that a group of\nstudents studied last year,\nstudying it on behalf\nof a group in Asia,\nwas parametric insurance\nfor airline delays.\nIf you could embed on a\ntamper-resistant ledger.\nOn that ledger, you would\nembed smart contracts\nthat says if the plane takes off\nmore than a half hour late, you\nautomatically get paid.\nA mobile app.\nNo trying to rely\non the airlines\nwhether they're\naccurately telling you\nor not that the\nplane took off late.\nPut it on a\nblockchain technology.\nNow, maybe you could do it with\na central database as well,\nbut there are many\npeople looking\nto whether to use\nblockchain technology\nfor parametric insurance.\nBut the sensors and telematics,\nthe visual computing,\nthe machine learning,\nthose are real.\nThe Department of\nTreasury sort of also put\nsomething on the edge in terms\nof blockchain technology."], "1920": [15, 210, "There's still the age-old\nchallenge of funding.\nAnd it's particularly\ntrue in insurance\nbecause if you take an insurance\nrisk onto your balance sheet,\nthat's a liability of\nan insurance company.\nThat's a liability\nthat in the future\nthey have to pay out a\nclaim on an accident, a loss\non your home, or on your life.\nSo many companies are\nfinding challenges.\nIf they're startups, how\ncan they access capital?\nNow in the banking\nsector, you can possibly\ndo it through securitization.\nYou can basically\nsay I'm not going\nto build my own balance sheet.\nI'm going to sort of\nrent a balance sheet.\nI'm going to lay it off.\nSimilarly here, you can lay off\nsome risk in the reinsurance\nmarkets, but it's\nnot quite the same\nfor these insurtech startups.\nMost challenger banks\npartner with some bank,\nget a warehouse line of\ncredit, and possibly also then\nsell their loans after\nthey're initiated.\nHere, it's not as robust.\nIt's not as developed.\nBut again, many insurance\nfintech startups\nare saying do I partner with a\nbig, dominant insurance company\nbecause I can't build my\nbalance sheet as rapidly?\nIf you choose to be a carrier--\nand a carrier is the term to say\nyou actually take the insurance\nonto your balance sheet.\nYou have the liability.\nChoose to be a carrier, it's\nbalance-sheet intensive.\nAlso, just how do you find\nyour startup run-rate loss\nbecause all the\nstartups tend to have\nmultiple years of\nbuilding out a network\nand building the\nplatform itself.\nClearly the\ncompetitive landscape,\nthe regulatory frameworks--\nthe regulatory frameworks,\ndo you get licensed?\nAgain, similar to\nthe challenger banks.\nRemember we talked about\nthere's neobanks and challenger\nbanks which often people sort\nof say in the same breath\nthey're the same.\nBut more specifically,\na neobank is\nsomething doing a lot\nof banking functions\nthat has not yet gotten\na banking license.\nSimilar here, if you're thinking\nabout starting an insurance\nfintech firm, what type\nof licensing will you get?\nWill it just be a\nbrokerage licensing?\nIn various\njurisdictions, you have\nto register to be a\nbroker or an agent.\nAre you actually registering\nto take lines onto your balance\nsheet and become a carrier?\nAnd then, of course, user\nadoption and the use of data.\nAnd in terms of the\nuse of data, there\naren't quite the same laws.\nWe have the same\nconceptual framework\nthat you have to be\nfair and unbiased,\nbut there aren't\nquite the same laws\nlike the Equal Credit\nOpportunity Act here in the US.\nAnd in terms of the use of\ndata, as we'll see in a minute,\nif you sign a waiver and say\nyou can use my driving record\nto give my insurance,\nis Alexandro did,\nthey can use that data also\non the claims-management side.\nIt's not just to lower the cost.\nIt's also to see, if you\ncall up and say an accident,\nthey look at the telematics and\nsay, did this really happen?"], "2130": [16, 310, "into this slide, but it's\njust each of these pieces--\neach of these\npieces, it might be\nthat you're trying to go into\nthe billing and payments, which\nis sort of rudimentary, sort of.\nYou could be going all\nthe way to another area\nand say we're going\nto be the best data\nanalytics on wearables.\nAnd by I mean wearables, how\nmany people have a Fitbit?\nDoes anybody want to talk\nabout whether you've signed up\nfor insurance that\nyour insurance company\ncan get your data\noff of your Fitbit\nor off of your Apple watch?\nWhat you're using\nfor exercise can\nlower your cost of insurance.\nI'm going to pause, Romain.\nTEACHING ASSISTANT: I\ndon't see any hands up.\nLindsay, go ahead.\nAUDIENCE: Well, I didn't\nhave like the agreement\nwith the insurance,\nbut what I did have\nis that my former employer had\na program where we would connect\nour tracking devices\nlike for steps and stuff\nwith this program that\nwould give you kickbacks\nif you got so many steps a day.\nSo I'd get tons of gift cards\nbecause of all the steps\nI tracked in.\nAnd that data I'm sure was\ngoing to the insurance company\nto lower the insurance rates.\nGARY GENSLER: Right.\nSo if you got to your\n10,000 steps-- or maybe\nthey gave you a premium\nfor 5,000 steps.\nYou got some rewards.\nWe all know about rewards\nprograms in credit cards,\nand that's part of that 2\nand 3/4% interchange fees.\nThese rewards by your\nemployer, ultimately\nthe economic incentives\nis the employer\ncan have lower cost\nof health insurance.\nThat data through\nthe intermediation\nof your employment contract was\nlowering health-insurance costs\nfor some group health insurance.\nNow, I think your\nemployer was also\ndoing it because they know if\nyou're a better health that you\nalso have fewer days off.\nYou'll be hopefully\na better employee.\nSo they're also lowering\nsome of their costs\nin terms of their direct\ncosts, but it also\nrelates to health insurance.\nSo wearables, trackables,\ntelematics, and the internet\nof thing.\nThe internet of thing\nis about sensors.\nAnd it's about sensors in many\nitems in our home as well.\nIf you have a home\nsecurity system,\nin the last 5 or\n10 years, you've\nbeen able to tie\nthat into more data.\nNow, home security systems\nhave for decades somehow\nhad to communicate\nthrough a security company\nto the law enforcement\nif the alarm went off,\nbut I'm talking about\nmore fine-tune monitoring.\nAnd we all are aware, even\nthough that very few of us\nmight have it, that you\ncan have apps on your phone\nthat you can communicate\nwith your home\nto turn on your heat or\nyour air conditioning,\nmonitor your home,\nhome-monitoring devices that\nmakes all of us maybe\nmore comfortable\nthat our home is\nsecure or even to have\nthe communication from the\nhome if, for some reason,\nthere is a problem in the home.\nAnd there's sensors\non refrigerators.\nThere's sensors on HVAC,\nheating and ventilation systems.\nThere are sensors\nthroughout houses.\nThe 2020s, we're going to see\nthis just absolutely mushroom\nin terms of sensors.\nSo what's that data do\nfor the insurance field?\nThat's why I think insurtech\nand insurance and fintech\nis such an exciting and\ninteresting place because we\nare basically in a\ntransformational time\nright now in terms of sensor\ntechnology and embedding\nsensors into our economies\nnot because of insurance\nbut because many users\nwant to sort of monitor\neither their home, their\nautomobile, their wearable,\ntheir trackable.\nAnd now with this\nreally challenging time\naround the coronavirus\ncrisis, we're\ntalking about contact tracing.\nAnd all that contact\ntracing could also\nbe fed in, depending\nupon the jurisdiction,\ndepending upon the regulation,\ninto health-insurance rates,\nlife-insurance rates, or\nany form of insurance.\nAgain, largely dependent upon\nthe various jurisdictions'\nregulatory and legal frameworks.\nSo what are some of\nthe possibilities?"], "2440": [17, 30, "That means actually\ncommitting balance sheet,\nbecoming licensed, taking\nclaims on as a liability,\nmanaging the asset side as well.\nYou can be a managed\ngeneral agent.\nThink broker.\nThis is just a term to\nsay you could be managing\nagents or brokerage or sales.\nThose are kind of\nthe two big divides.\nBut you could just be\non the technology side\nor the data-aggregation side."], "2470": [18, 70, "Some of the startups-- we won't\ngo through each one of them,\nbut you're going to see a\ncommon thing in these lists is,\nby and large, all\nfounded in the 20-teens.\nSo this is 5 or 10\nyears of dynamic change.\nYou're going to\nsee heavy emphasis\non homeowners and autos.\nSo it's in the consumer\nspace, very similar to credit.\nYou see a little bit moving\ninto small business but not\nlarge commercial lines,\nthough Bold Penguin\nis a commercial\ninsurance exchange.\nA lot is on the front end.\nAnd on the auto side, you also\nget marketplace comparisons,\njust like in the credit space.\nIt's basically Expedia\nfor auto insurance, so\nto speak you could say,\nor Expedia for fill\nin the blank insurance.\nThese are the\nmarketplace comparisons\nlike CoverHound and Goji."], "2540": [19, 50, "small business is\nkind of the dominant.\nHas anybody used the product\nLemonade for renters insurance?\nWow.\nTEACHING ASSISTANT: I\ndon't see any hands up.\nGARY GENSLER: Nobody.\nSo Lemonade got into\nthe field basically\nto say so many people,\nparticularly in the US,\nare renting, and we just want\nsome insurance for our objects\nand our things in our homes\nin case there's a problem.\nOr maybe the landlord says you\nhave to have renters insurance."], "2590": [20, 110, "one of the largest marketplace\ncomparison in India.\nIt is a remarkable platform.\nAgain, think, broadly speaking,\nExpedia for health and life\ninsurance where you\ncan price compare--\nPolicyBazaar.\nOf these various companies--\njust pause a bit on Root.\nRoot uses telematics to\nprice their products.\nAlmost every one of the\nauto companies on here\nare using telematics\nand smartphones.\nSome of them started\non telematics,\nsome started more on\nthe smartphone side,\nbut the merger of those two.\nTractable in the auto field is\nabout claims management, just\nsolely sort of focusing there.\nAnd I said I was going\nto mention about China,\nthe last on this\nlist, and I probably\nwill mispronounce how to say it.\nZhongAn was formed by\nthree very large companies.\nOnline property and\ncasualty in China.\nIt's gone public since.\nIt's a very significant\ncompany in China.\nIt's the only online\ninsurance company\nthat got licensing in China.\nSo it chose to get licensing.\nIt had the backing of\nthree very large companies\nseven years ago.\nIt got said licensing, and\nit has a certain advantage.\nTo my knowledge, I don't think\nanybody else has been there.\nSo it gives you some\nof the smattering.\nI'm going to pause, Romain, to\nsee if there's any questions.\nAre we good?"], "2700": [21, 40, "GARY GENSLER: Health care--\nhealth-care fintech.\nI'd still call it insurtech.\nSome people can\ncall it healthtech.\nThis is the insurance\nside and how technology\nis coming in to disrupt.\nAgain, you could be\nin any piece of this.\nI borrowed this\nchart FT partners,\nbut you could be in\nany piece of this\nand say I'm going to\ndo the payments side.\nI'm going to do the claims side.\nI'm going to be in\nbenefits management,\nbut any piece of this."], "2740": [22, 60, "of

this goes to\nthe earlier question\nabout Google and health care.\nWhile we haven't\nseen big tech there,\nI think that we're bound to\nbecause there's so many data\nanalytic.\nCambridge Mobile\nTelematics do not-- please\ndon't confuse with Cambridge\nAnalytica but Cambridge Mobile\nTelematics.\nYou can see there are\ndata aggregators that\nare collecting telematic data.\nThey're not

a\nproduct that in factories\nif your factory workers will\nwear some wearable-- not\na Fitbit.\nSome of it's like around\nthe midchest range.\nBut if they'll\nwear a sensor, you\ncan lower the cost of\nworkplace insurance.\nYou can also, hopefully,\nmake the workplace safer.\nSo they're selling a safety\ndevice, injury protection,\nbut it's about\nsoftware and hardware\nbecause they're\nselling the wearables.\nAnd it's called StrongArm Tech.\nWill it be successful?\nIt's been around nine years.\nSo what you're seeing\nin insurance tech, which\nI think is so fascinating and\npotentially transformative, is\na whole world of sensors and\ncollecting alternative data,\nwhether it's from our cars back\nto the telematics, whether it's\nfrom our watches or our\nwearables, our Fitbits,\nfrom our smartphones, from the\nsensors in our homes, all that\ncan sort of collect data,\na little bit of machine\nlearning-- not\nalways deep machine\nlearning, deep learning,\nbut some machine learning.\nLower the costs, broaden\nthe inclusion potentially.\nAnd then on the\nclaims-management side\nas well, sensor technology,\ncollecting the data,\nlowering the fraud,\nand the like.\nThere's one firm that brags\nthat they have the shortest\nclaim-settlement period,\nthat an online app was\nable to get claims settlement\ndown to less than minutes.\nAnd I think there was one claim\nthat was settled in seconds.\nIt was an automobile accident.\nIt was something they could do\nquite quickly technologically,\nbut I also think that it was\na bit of a marketing thing,\nthat they wanted to say\nyou could get claims\nmanagement down to minutes.\nSo that sort of is a\nlittle bit of review."]}
