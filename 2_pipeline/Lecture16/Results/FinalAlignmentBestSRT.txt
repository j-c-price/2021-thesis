their inputs over time--\nand that particular model is\ncalled a resistor capacitor\nmodel or an RC\nmodel of a neuron.\nWe're going to go through how\nto derive the differential\nequations that describe that\nmodel-- it's actually quite\nsimple, but some\nof you may not have\nbeen through that before,\nso I want to go through it\nstep by step so we\ncan really understand\nwhere that comes

going to\nstart working on where\nthe batteries of a neuron\nactually come from, OK?\nOK.\nSo-- all right.\nSo-- all right.\nSo we're going to basically\ntalk about the following sort"], "180": [3, 240, "The following conceptual idea.\nWe're going to take\na neuron and we're\ngoing to put it in a\nbath of sailing, OK?\nA saltwater solution that\nrepresents the extracellular\nsolution that

that we can\nmeasure the voltage,\nand we're going to study\nhow this neuron responds--\nhow the voltage of the neuron\nresponds to current injections,\nOK?\nNow why is it that we\nwant to actually do that?\nWhy is that an interesting or\nimportant experiment to do?\nAnybody have any\nidea why we would\nwant to actually measure\nvoltage and current\nfor a neuron in the brain?\nYes?\nAUDIENCE: Be able to use the\nmathematical model [INAUDIBLE]\nprovided for us?\nMICHALE FEE: OK, but\nit's more than just\nso that we can describe\nit mathematically, right?\nIt's because these things--\nsomething about\nvoltage and current\nare actually relevant to\nhow a neuron functions.\nYes?\nAUDIENCE: Like the\nresistance inside?\nMICHALE FEE: Yeah.\nSo that's an important\nquantity, but we're\nlooking for something\nmore fundamental,\nlike why is it\nactually important\nthat we understand how voltage\nchanges when a neuron has\ncurrent injected into it?\nHabiba?\nAUDIENCE: Equals [INAUDIBLE]\ndifferent like ion channels,\na different set of\nvoltages [INAUDIBLE]..\nMICHALE FEE: Exactly.\nSo ion channels are\nsensitive to voltage,\nand the way they function\ndepends very critically\non voltage.\nSo many-- if not\nmost-- ion channels\nare voltage sensitive and are\ncontrolled by voltage, OK?\nAnd that's exactly why.\nSo nearly every aspect of\nwhat neurons do in the brain\nas you're walking around looking\nat things and doing things\nis controlled by\nvoltage, and that\ngoes through the voltage\nsensitivity of buying channels,\nOK?\nBut what is it that changes\nthe voltage in a neuron?\nYes?\nAUDIENCE: The action potential.\nMICHALE FEE: That's\non the output side.\nYes?\nAUDIENCE: Is it\nion concentration?\nMICHALE FEE: Good.\nThat's correct.\nI'm

[INAUDIBLE]\nMICHALE FEE: Yes.\nSo the answer is that\nthe voltage of a neuron\nchanges because--\nthe reason current is important\nis because the reason voltage\nchanges in a neuron is because\nother cells are injecting\ncurrent into our neuron.\nSensory inputs are injecting\ncurrent into our neuron, OK?\nEverything that a neuron\nreceives, all the information\nthat a neuron receives from\nother neurons in the network\nand from the outside world\ncomes from currents being\ninjected into that neuron, OK?\nAnd so it's really\nimportant that we understand\nhow the neuron transforms that\ncurrent input from other cells\nand from the sensory periphery\ninto voltage changes that\nthen change the behavior\nof ion channels.\nIs that clear?\nThat link of current\ninputs to voltage output\nis really crucial,\nand that's why we're\ndoing this experiment, OK?\nOK, and that's this\npoint right here.\nOK, so one of the\nfirst things we're"], "420": [4, 40, "is that neurons can\nperform analog integration.\nThey can perform numerical\nintegration over time, OK?\nThat's pretty cool.\nVoltage is that integral over\ntime of the injected current.\nTo first order.\nIt's the simplest\nbehavior of a neuron.\nSo if you measure the\nvoltage of a neuron\nand you turn on current and\nyou turn the current on,\nthe voltage of a\nneuron will ramp up,\nintegrating that\ninput over time, OK?\nPretty cool.\nSo we're going to\nsee how that happens,\nwhy that happens biophysically.\nOK."], "460": [5, 400, "do this experiment.\nSo these electrodes are\nlittle pieces of glass tubing.\nSo you take a fine glass\ntube about a millimeter\nacross you heat it up in\nthe middle over a flame,\nand you pull it apart when\nit melts in the middle,\nand it makes a very sharp point.\nYou break off the fine little\nthread of glass that's left,\nand you have a tube that narrows\ndown to a very sharp point,\nbut it's still a tube, and\nyou can literally just--\nthere are some cells, like in\nthe old days people studied\nlarge neurons and in\nsnails where the cells are\na millimeter across, you\ncan take an electrode\nand literally just by hand\npoke it into the cell.\nAnd then you fill that\nelectrode with a salt solution,\nand then you put a wire in\nthe back of that electrode,\nand you hook it up\nto an amplifier.\nNow we want to measure\nthe voltage in the cell.\nRemember, voltage is\nalways voltage difference.\nWe're always measuring\nthe difference\nbetween the voltage in one place\nand the voltage somewhere else.\nSo this amplifier\nhas two inputs.\nIt's called a\ndifferential amplifier,\nand we're going to hook\nthe electrode that's\nin the cell to\nthe plus terminal,\nwe're going to put\na wire in the bath,\nhook it to the minus\nterminal, and this amplifier\nis measuring the difference\nbetween the voltage\ninside the cell and the\nvoltage outside the cell, OK?\nAny questions about that?\nSo we're going to take the other\nhalf of that piece of glass\nthat we pulled, fill\nit with salt solution,\nstick it in the cell, and\nwe're going to hook it up\nto a current source.\nNow our current source is\nbasically just a battery, OK?\nBut it's got some\nfancy electronics\nsuch that the current that flows\nis equal to whatever value you\nset, OK?\nAnd of course,\nremember, that voltage\nis in units of volts and\ncurrent is charge per second.\nCharge is coulombs, so\ncoulombs per second,\nand that's equal to the unit\nof current, which is amperes.\nAll right.\nNow let's take a closer look\nat our little spherical neuron,\nour little neuron.\nWe've chopped all the\ndendrites and axons off,\nso it's just a little\nsphere, and you can basically\nmodel a neuron just like any\nother cell as a spherical shell\nof insulating material, OK?\nIn this case, a lipid bilayer.\nThis is a phospholipid bilayer.\nPhospholipids are just little\nfat molecules that have a polar\nhead on one side-- that means\nthey're soluble in water\non this side, and they\nhave a non-polar tail,\nso they don't like to be\nin contact with water,\nand the two polar\ntails go end to end--\nsorry, the non-polar\ntails go end to end,\nthe polar heads face\nout into the water.\nDoes that makes sense?\nAnd they are very closely\npacked together so\nthat ions can't pass\nthrough that membrane,\nso it's insulating.\nIt's very thin, it's only\nabout 23 angstroms across, OK?\nAn angstrom is about the\nsize of a hydrogen atom.\nThey're very thin, OK?\nOK, we have saline inside.\nWhat is saline?\nWhat is it in our model?\nRemember on Tuesday what--\nAUDIENCE: A wire.\nMICHALE FEE: Good.\nIt's a wire and we have saline\noutside, which is also a wire.\nSo we have two wires separated\nby an insulator, what is that?\nThat's a capacitor, because\nit's two conductors separated\nby an insulator, OK?\nSo an electrical component\nthat behaves like a capacitor--\nlike if you were to\nbuild one of those,\nyou would take like a\npiece of aluminum foil,\nput a piece of paper on it, put\nanother piece of aluminum foil\nnext to it, and\nattach wires to that,\nand you would squeeze the\nstack of aluminum foil paper\nand aluminum foil together, and\nthat becomes a capacitor, OK?\nAnd it has a symbol that\nlooks like this electrically.\nSo this is now our equivalent\ncircuit of this model neuron,\nOK?\nIt's very simple.\nIt's a capacitor\nwith one wire here\nthat represents the inside of\nthe cell, another wire that\nrepresents the\noutside of the cell.\nWe have a current\nsource that connects\nthe outside of the cell\nto the inside of the cell.\nWhen we turn on\nthe current source,\nit takes charges\nfrom inside of here\nand sticks them\nthrough the electrode\nand pumps them into the cell.\nDoes that makes sense?\nThis is our-- this is sort\nof a simplified symbol\nfor a voltage-measuring device.\nThe voltage difference\nbetween the inside of the cell\nand the outside of the cell\nis what we're measuring here,\nand that difference is called\nthe membrane potential.\nIt's the voltage difference\nbetween the inside\nand the outside of the\nmembrane, all right?\nAny questions about that?\nYes?\nAUDIENCE: There's a narrow\nresistance for [INAUDIBLE]..\nMICHALE FEE: What's that?\nAUDIENCE: The resistance for--\nMICHALE FEE: Yes,\nbut we're going\nto do it one piece at a time.\nSo we're going to\nstart with a capacitor.\nThe resistor will\ncome in a few slides.\nYes?\nAUDIENCE: So the [INAUDIBLE].\nMICHALE FEE: Exactly.\nSo we've simplified our\nneurons so that it's\njust an insulating shell, OK?\nNo ion channels, no\ncurrent anywhere else.\nIf we want to inject current\ninto this simple model neuron,\nwe have to inject it through\nthis electrode here, OK?\nSo we're just going down\nto the very simplest case,\nbecause this is already\nkind of interesting enough\nto understand just by itself.\nYes?\nAUDIENCE: So if the cell's\nacting as a capacitor,\nis their energy stored\nin their myelin?\nMICHALE FEE: The\nenergy is stored\nin the electric field\nthat crosses the bilayer,\nand I'll get to\nthat in a second.\nAny other questions?\nOK, great questions.\nAll right, so what happens\nwhen we inject current\ninto our neuron?\nAs I said, the current\nsource is pulling charges\nfrom the outside and pumping\nthem into the inside,\nall right?"], "860": [6, 280, "So what we're doing is we\nare injecting current-- let's\nsay this is our capacitor.\nThere are charges, there\nare ions on the inside\nthat are just up against the\ninside of the cell membrane.\nThere are charges\non the outside, OK?\nAnd when we inject a charge\nfrom the outside to the inside--\nlet's put one of those\ncharges right here.\nAnd we're going to push it\ninto this cell, when you inject\na charge, you get\nan excessive charge\non the inside of the\ncell membrane, OK?\nAnd what does that do?\nYou now have more positive\ncharges inside than outside,\nlike-charges repel--\nso it pushes one\nof those charges\naway from the outside\nof the membrane.\nDoes that makes sense?\nOK, that's kind of interesting.\nWe took a charge, we pushed\nit in, and a charge comes out.\nRight?\nWe have a current flowing.\nWe have charges coming\nin and charges leaving.\nWe have a current flowing\nthrough an insulator.\nHow is that possible?\nIt's a capacitive current, OK?\nNo charges are actually\npassing through the insulator,\nbut it looks like you\nhave a current flowing.\nThat's called a\ncapacitive current.\nAnd we represent that in\nour diagram by a current\nI sub C, capacitive current that\nflows through the capacitor.\nPretty cool, right?\nYou have a current flowing\nthrough an insulator.\nThat's what a capacitor is.\nOK.\nNow notice that you\nhave a charge imbalance.\nYou have three positive\ncharges here and only\none positive charge here.\nSo there is an excess of two\npositive charges on the inside.\nThat's because we added a\npositive charge to the inside\nand took away a positive\ncharge from the outside,\nso that leaves a charge\nimbalance of 2, OK?\nWhat do you get between positive\ncharge and negative charge\nif you hold them\nnext to each other?\nWhat is there in between?\nAUDIENCE: It's attraction.\nMICHALE FEE: Good,\nit's attraction,\nbut what is it that\ncauses that attraction?\nRemember yesterday, we talked\nabout a something on a charge\nproduces a force, what is it?\nAUDIENCE: Electric field.\nMICHALE FEE: Good.\nSo there's an electric\nfield between the positive--\nthe excess positive charges here\nand the excess negative charges\nhere, OK?\nThat's an electric\nfield, all right?\nAnd that electric\nfield stores energy.\nHow do you know there's\nenergy in this system, though?\nWhat could you do to\ndemonstrate that there is\nenergy stored in that system?\nAny ideas?\nYou have two plates, two\nmetal plates, let's say,\nin the metal version of this.\nSeparated by an insulator.\nWhat would happen if you\npulled away the insulator?\nThose two things would do\nthat again, but louder--\nboom.\nWhat does that take\nto make that sound?\nEnergy, OK?\nSo there's energy stored\nin that electric field.\nSo there's a charge imbalance,\nthere's an electric field.\nWhat does an electric field over\nsome distance correspond to?\nAUDIENCE: A voltage difference.\nMICHALE FEE: A voltage\ndifference, OK?\nNow, there's a charge imbalance\nand a voltage difference,\nand they're proportional\nto each other.\nSo there's a\nproportionality constant\nthat's called the\ncapacitance, all right?\nIf you can put a lot of charge\nand have a small voltage\ndifference, that's\na big capacitor.\nNow you can get a big capacitor\njust by having a big area.\nYou can see, you can have a lot\nof charges with a small voltage\ndifference if you have big\nplates on your capacitor, OK?\nSo the capacitance is actually\nproportional to the area\nof the plates,\nand it's inversely\nproportional to the\ndistance between them.\nIt's a very thin\nmembrane, which means\nyou can get a lot of\ncapacitance in a tiny area, OK?\nThat's pretty cool.\nAll right, any questions?\nSo charge is coulombs, and there\nare 6 times 10 to the charges\nin a coulomb, the\nelemental charges, electron\nor monovalent ion charges.\nVoltage is in units of\nvolts, and the capacitance\nis in units of farads."], "1140": [7, 140, "All right.\nSo we have our relation between\nvoltage difference and charge\ndifference.\nAnd what we're\ngoing to do is we're\ngoing to calculate this\ncapacitive current.\nHow do you think\nwe would calculate\nthe capacitive current?\nWell, the capacitive\ncurrent is just\nthe rate at which the charge\nimbalance is changing, right?\nCurrent is just charge\nper unit of time.\nOK?\nSo we're going to calculate the\ncapacitive current as the time\nrate of change of the charge--\nand I've dropped\nthe deltas here.\nSo capacitive current\nis dQ/dt, all right?\nAnd remember that Q is just\nCV, so the capacitive current\nis just C dV/dt, and\nthe Vm here represents\nthe membrane potential, OK?\nSo the capacitive current\nthrough a membrane\nis just the capacitance\ntimes the time rate of change\nof the membrane potential.\nAny questions?\nOK.\nPretty straightforward.\nNow what we're\ngoing to do now is\nwe're going to relate\nthe injected charge\nto the-- sorry, the injected\ncurrent to the capacitor.\nAnd what does Kirchhoff's\ncurrent law tell us?\nIt tells us that the amount of\ncurrent going into this wire\nhas to be equal to the amount\nof current leaving that wire.\nOK?\nSo we can write that\ndown as follows.\nThe difference in sign here is\nbecause the electrode current\nis defined as positive\ninward, the capacitive current\nis defined as positive outward.\nOK?\nSo you can see that\nwe just calculated\nthe capacitive\ncurrent, it's C dV/dt,\nso we can just\nplug that in here,\nand now we see this\nvery simple relation\nbetween the injected\ncurrent and the voltage.\nAnd again, the current\nhas unit of amperes,\nwhich is coulombs per second."], "1280": [8, 140, "OK, so we have that.\nNow we have a\ndifferential equation\nthat describes the relation\nbetween current and voltage,\nwe can just integrate\nit to get the solution.\nSo that membrane\npotential will just\nbe some initial membrane\npotential at time 0\nplus 1 over C integral over\ntime of the injected current.\nJust integrate both sides.\nYou get V here, you get\nintegral of I there,\nand divide both sides\nby C. Any questions?\nIt's either really\nconfusing or really obvious.\nYeah?\nEverybody OK?\nAll right, good.\nNow what is this?\nWhat is the integral\nof current over time?\nAUDIENCE: It's\ncharge [INAUDIBLE]\nMICHALE FEE: Good.\nIt's the amount of charge\nyou injected between time\n0 and time t, right?\nAnd what is the amount of charge\nyou inject-- if I tell you\nthat I injected an amount of\ncharge delta Q, how much did\nI change the voltage?\nDelta V is delta Q over\nC, and that's exactly.\nSo the voltage is just\nthe starting voltage\nplus delta voltage.\nDoes that makes sense?\nThis integral here is just--\nthat part is just\nthe amount of charge\nyou injected divided by C gives\nyou the change in the voltage.\nSo the voltage is just the\nstarting voltage plus delta V,\nOK?\nYes?\nAUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]\nMICHALE FEE: What's that?\nAUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]\nMICHALE FEE: Oh.\nBecause this equation\nhere just came from here.\nThat was our charge--\nour relation between charge\nbalance and voltage difference.\nYeah?\nIf it's not clear, just\nplease ask, thank you.\nOK.\nThere we go."], "1420": [9, 270, "It's just some constant\ntimes time, right?\nSo our voltage is just\nsome initial voltage\nplus the injected current\nover C times time.\nAnd so you can see where\nthis comes from, right?\nWhen you turn the\ncurrent on, the voltage\njust increases\nlinearly over time\nwith a slope that's given\nby the current divided\nby the capacitance.\nOK?\nAll right, any questions?\nYou guys are being very quiet.\nThis is the point where\nI start feeling nervous,\nI went too fast.\nYes?\nAUDIENCE: You continually\ndraw the curve for a while--\nMICHALE FEE: Yep.\nAUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]\nMICHALE FEE: Yes, it does.\nAnd it breaks at\nabout a volt or so.\nBecause the electric\nfield gets so strong,\nit literally just\nrips the atoms apart\nin the molecules of\nthe lipid bilayer.\nYes?\nAUDIENCE: Why do you [INAUDIBLE]\nMICHALE FEE: Sorry,\nI shouldn't say--\nit doesn't rip the atoms apart,\nit rips the molecules apart.\nYou need much higher\nelectric fields to do that.\nYes?\nAUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]\nMICHALE FEE: Oh.\nBecause we're integrating\nfrom time 0 to time t.\nWe want to know the\nvoltage at time t, OK?\nWe're starting at 0, we're\nintegrating the current\nfrom time 0 to time t,\nwhich is where we're wanting\nto know the voltage, right?\nSo you have to integrate\nthe current from 0 to t.\nWe can't use t in here.\nt is the endpoint.\nYeah.\nDoes that makes sense?\nGood question, thank you.\nOK, everybody all right?\nI'm going to stand here until\nI hear one more question.\nYes?\nAUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]\nMICHALE FEE: Oh, here.\nBecause it's a\ncurrent of value I0.\nGreat question.\nYes?\nAUDIENCE: So to maintain this\nconstant current [INAUDIBLE]\nthe amount of [INAUDIBLE]\nyou're pumping it and--\nMICHALE FEE: Yes.\nThat's right.\nThis-- OK, I should have\nmaybe been more clear.\nThis current source has a\nknob on it that I get to set.\nI get to like--\nthere would be an\napp now, and I'd\npull out my current\nsource app and I\ntype in 10 milliamps, boom.\nAnd this thing-- because\nthere's a Bluetooth connection\nto this thing, and it like sets\nthis thing to 10 milliamps,\nand it just keeps pumping\n10 milliamps until you tell\nit to do something else, OK?\nYes?\nAUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] make the\nright direction instead of it\nbeing constant current\nstate that usually--\nMICHALE FEE: Oh, OK.\nAUDIENCE: --that would\ncreate some weird kind of--\nMICHALE FEE: Sure.\nYeah.\nWhat would that be, actually?\nIf you put in a linear\nramp in current?\nIt would be a parabolic\nvoltage profile.\nYeah, very good.\nThat's exactly it.\nThis current profile that\nyou-- this voltage profile\nis literally just the numerical\nintegral of this function.\nSo all you have to\ndo is look at this\nand integrate it in\nyour head, and you can\nsee what the voltage does, OK?\nGreat.\nThat's exactly right.\nSo let's do another example.\nLet's put in a current pulse.\nSo we start at zero current,\nwe step it up to I0,\nwe hold it there for tau,\nthen we turn the current off.\nSo let's start our\nneuron right here.\nWhat's going to happen?\nWhat's your name?\nI'm going to ask you\nto do this problem.\nWhat-- yeah.\nAUDIENCE: Sammy.\nMICHALE FEE: Sammy.\nWhat's this voltage going to do?\nAUDIENCE: So I'd say constant.\nMICHALE FEE: Good.\nBecause it's zero current.\nThen what's going to happen?\nAUDIENCE: And it's\ngoing to [INAUDIBLE]\nMICHALE FEE: Good.\nAUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]\nMICHALE FEE:

you to get used to it.\nSo what does this mean?\nSo let's rewrite this\nequation a little bit.\nLet's move this term\nto the other side\nand divide both sides by\ntau, and here's what you get.\ndV/dt equals minus\n1 over tau V minus--"], "2160": [14, 300, "OK?\nNow let's take a look at what\nthe derivative dV/dt looks\nlike as a function of voltage.\nYes?\nAUDIENCE: So why\ncouldn't we have

Rishi.\nOK.\nI'm going to make an\nattempt to remember names.\nSo is everyone clear about that?\nV infinity is defined\nas the resistance\ntimes this injected current.\nSo the injected current, when

capacitance\nhas units time, OK?\nAnd so we call it tau.\nTau is just a constant, OK?\nSo hang on, bear with me.\nThe derivative is a\nfunction of voltage.\nAnd at V equals V infinity,\nthe derivative is 0, right?\nThat's the definition\nof the infinity,\nit's the voltage at which\nthe derivative is 0.\nYeah?\nAnd the voltage is less than\nV infinity, the derivative\nis positive, right?\nWhen the voltage is\nbelow the infinity,\nthe derivative of\nvoltage is positive.\nSo what is the voltage doing?\nIt's approaching V infinity.\nIf the voltage is\nabove V infinity,\nvoltage greater than V infinity,\nthe derivative is negative.\nSo voltage does what?\nAUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]\nMICHALE FEE: Yes, but it's--\nAUDIENCE: Approaches--\nMICHALE FEE: It\napproaches V infinity.\nSo no matter where\nvoltage is, it's\nalways approaching V infinity.\nIf it's below V infinity,\nthe slope is positive,\nand it approaches V infinity.\nIf it's above V infinity,\nthe slope is negative,\nand it approaches V\ninfinity from above.\nPretty cool, right?\nSo V is always just\nrelaxing toward V infinity.\nAnd how does it get there?\nDoes it go linearly?\nWell, you can see\nthat the slope--\nthe rate at which\nit approaches V\ninfinity is proportional to how\nfar away it is from V infinity.\nAnd so it doesn't just go vroom,\nboom, crash into V infinity,\nit kind of slowly\napproaches V

approaches quickly.\nIf tau is long, it\napproaches slow.\nYou can see that if tau is\nbig, the derivatives are small.\nIf tau is small, the derivatives\nare bigger, all right?\nAny questions about that?\nYes?\nAUDIENCE: So a\ntau usually is a--\nMICHALE FEE: Sorry,\nsay it again?\nAUDIENCE: --times\nequals to tau--\nMICHALE FEE: Yes.\nAUDIENCE: --is V\ninfinity plus 1 over e.\nMICHALE FEE: At

voltage--\nsorry-- the current controls\nwhat in that equation?\nThe current controls V infinity.\nSo we can plot V\ninfinity immediately,\nbecause V infinity is\njust the resistance\ntimes the

happens?\nGood.\nWhat is it doing?\nAUDIENCE: Approaching\nfrom infinity.\nMICHALE FEE: Good.\nIt approaches.\nSo V at every point\nis relaxing toward V\ninfinity exponentially, right?\nAnd that looks like--\nat some time constant, and that\nlooks like this, all right?\nNow what happens here?\nAUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]\nMICHALE FEE: Good.\nBecause V infinity\nsuddenly change to 0,\nand so V relaxes toward\nV infinity exponentially\nwith some time constant.\nOK?\nAny questions?\nOK.\nNow this-- that is our\nRC model neuron, OK?\nResistance times\ncapacitance-- they\ngot a resistor and a\ncapacitor, but the solutions\nare just exponential decays\ntoward some steady state\nsolution.\nNow it turns out\nthat an RC system,\na first order linear system\nacts like a filter, OK?\nSo

tells us\nhow much current is\ndue to diffusion,\nand you can set the sum of\nthose two things to equal zero,\nall right?\nAnd so this is the\nway it would look.\nI don't expect you to follow\nanything on this slide\njust except to see that it\ncan be done in this way, OK?\nSo you don't even have\nto write this down, OK?\nSo the drift current\nis proportion-- it's\nsome constant times voltage.\nFisk's law is some constant\ntimes that concentration\ngradient, remember that.\nAnd we just set those two things\nequal and solve for delta V,\nand that's what you find.\nWhat you find is the delta V\nis just some constant times\nthe log of the difference\nin concentrations\non the inside and outside, OK?\nNow it turns out, there's a\nway of calculating this that's\nmuch simpler and\nmore elegant, and I'm\ngoing to show you\nthat calculation, OK?\nYes?\nAUDIENCE: And so like\nthe concentrations inside\nand outside, like at the\n[INAUDIBLE] beginning of the--\nMICHALE FEE: Yes,\nat the beginning.\nAnd the answer is that the\nconcentrations don't change\nvery much through this\nprocess, so you can even\nignore that change, OK?\nAll right, everybody got this?\nAll right.\nSo here's how we're\ngoing to calculate\nan alternative\nway of calculating\nthis voltage difference,\njust really beautiful."], "4420": [32, 80, "The Boltzmann equation\ntells the
