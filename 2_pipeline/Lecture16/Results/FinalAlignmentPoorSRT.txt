here it will decrease sorry over here what increase a little bit and the potassium concentration on the side will decrease a little bit\nwhat time it will stop changing and it will never come to equal

that question comes if we look at the voltage difference between the two sides what you see is it the voltage different started it 0\nand when we parked at home all of a sudden there is a rapidly

like a capacitor right and we some treasures diffused\nyou're a to hear some positive charges diffused from here to hear that charges up the side and so the voltage is positive we put positive chart more positive\nis there the voltage air goes up so\nif the voltage here is higher than voltage here were planning V1 - V2 the voltage here is lower than\nvoltage here and so this is going negative and

tells us how the voltage difference produces a current to the drift and we have fixed law that tells us how to\nis duded diffusion and you can set the sum of those two things to equal 0 alright\nso this is the way you would like I don't expect you to follow anything on the slide just accept the see that it can be done this way ok so\ndon't even have to write this down ok so the drift current is
