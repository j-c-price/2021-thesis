To understand how neurons respond to injected currents

To understand how membrane capacitance and resistance allows
neurons to integrate or smooth their inputs over time (RC model)

To understand how to derive the differential equations for the RC
model

To be able to sketch the response of an RC neuron to different
current inputs

ENDELEMENTWhy understand how neurons respond to
injected current?

 

* First, because nearly every aspect of computation and
signaling in a neuron is controlled by voltage. This control is
almost entirely mediated by the voltage sensitivity of ion
channels.

* In the brain, neurons have current injected into them:
> Through synapses from other neurons
> Oras a result of sensory stimuli

We are going to begin by considering the simplest case of a membrane
current — a simple leak (like a hole in the membrane)

In this case, the current through the ion channel can be modeled using
Ohm's Law

ENDELEMENTWhat is the steady-state solution to this equation?

Set dV, /dt = 0

We find that:
V, > V., = R, I,

Thus, we can rewrite our equation as follows

dv, where T=R,C

14
ENDELEMENTAn aside about first-order linear differential equations

We can rewrite our equation in the following form:

We see that the derivative is
* negative ifV>V.

dv = -t(v-v,) * positive if V < Vio

Thus, the voltage always approaches the
value Vg

And it approaches at a rate proportional “
to how far V is from V,,

What kind of function is this?

 

 

15
ENDELEMENTThus, under the condition that I, is constant (and thus V.,.) is constant:

V(t)-V. = -VJe"

While this solution applies only in the case of constant V.., it can be
very useful

model neuron with a leak conductance.

ENDELEMENTExtra notes on how to derive the Nernst potential
using the equations for electrodiffusion
ENDELEMENTElectrodiffusion and the Nernst Potential

In the last lecture, we found that the relation between drift velocity
and force for an ion in an electric field is:

where f = Ty, is just the coefficient of friction given by the Einstein-
Smoluchovski relation.

k =Boltzmann constant (J/K)
F = qE = electric force on ion due to T =temperature (K)
electric field E kT =thermal energy (J)
q = total ion charge in Coulombs D =diffusion constant (m2/s)
E = electric field (V/m)

43
ENDELEMENTElectrodiffusion and the Nernst Potential

Thus, we can write the drift velocity as:

gD qD is the ion mobility, which describes
Va = kT kT how fast an ion will move in an
electric field - (m/s)/(V/m)

We can find the total current density (amperes per unit area) as
N,c_ = ion density (ions/m?)

I
T= qN,c Vv, c = molar ion concentration (mol/m?)
N, = Avagadro’s number (ions/mol)
