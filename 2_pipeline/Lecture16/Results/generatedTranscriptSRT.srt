1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
good morning everyone ok so today we are going to continue

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:30,000
are the process of building our equivalent Circuit model of a Norman this this model was was actually Duval

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
to end the late 40s and early 50s by Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley who started working on the problem of understanding how neuron's make

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:50,000
potential sensor they studied the squid giant axon which is actually a very cold preparation because the axon is actually a buttermilk

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:00,000
process and so you can stick wires inside of it and I did a bunch of very quiet experiments to figure out how these

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:10,000
ionic conductance is and how these different components of the circuit work together to to make to make an action potential so that's that's

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:20,000
what we're going to continue doing were going to essentially continue describing and and motivating the different components of the circuit so today

8
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:30,000
we are going to get through the process of introducing a voltage measuring device a current source that the pass

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,000
conductance and we're gonna start introducing a battery ok so here's what we

10
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:50,000
to accomplish today so we want to understand how kind of at the simplest level how norms respond to injected currents

11
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:00,000
we want to understand how a membrane capacitance and membrane resistance allows neuron's to integrate their inputs overtime and

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:10,000
filter that Imports are smoother and puts overtime in that particular models call the resistor capacitor Model RC model of

13
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:20,000
we're going to go through how to derive the difference equations that describe that model it's actually quite simple but some of you

14
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:30,000
been through that before so I want to go through it step by step so we can really understand where that comes from and I were going to learn

15
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:40,000
who basically look at a at a apparent of an injection and we should be able to intuitively see how how the voltage of that Noranda

16
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:50,000
and we're going to start working on where the batteries of an Iran actually come from

17
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:00,000
alright so we're going to basically talk about the following sort of

18
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:10,000
experiment conceptual idea we're going to take another on and we're gonna put it in up in a bath of sailing k a salt water solution that

19
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:20,000
extracellular solution that you know extracellular solution in the brain and we're going to put an electrode into that Lawrence

20
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:30,000
you can inject current and we're going to put another electrode into the Nerang so that we can measure the voltage and remind the study how this nerong response

21
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:40,000
voltage of the wrong response to current injections why is it that we want to actually do that why is that an interesting

22
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:50,000
important experiment to do anybody have any idea why we would want to actually measure voltage and current for an Iran

23
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:00,000
yes ok

24
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:10,000
it's it's more than just so that we can describe it mathematically right it's because these things something about voltage and current or actual

25
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:20,000
tell event to Helen Mirren functions so that's important were looking for

26
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:30,000
more fundamentally why is it actually important that we understand how voltage changes when owner on his current injected into it a beaver

27
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:40,000
exactly so ion channels are sensitive to voltage

28
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:50,000
and the way they function depends very critically on voltage so many if not most ion channels are voltage sensitive

29
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:00,000
controlled by voltage and that's exactly why so nearly every aspect of what noran's do in

30
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:10,000
rain as you're walking around looking at things and doing things is controlled by voltage and that goes through the voltage sensitive

31
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:20,000
channels ok but what is it that changes the voltage in or on

32
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:30,000
yes that's on the output side yes

33
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:40,000
glad that's that's correct I'm looking for something a little bit different

34
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:50,000
good answers not quite what I'm looking for yes so the answer is

35
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:00,000
the voltage of a Norah changes because the reason current is important is because the reason voltage changes

36
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:10,000
is because other cells are injecting current into anora sensory inputs are injecting current into another on

37
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:20,000
everything that are Lauren receives all the information that are received from other neurones in the network in from the outside world comes from

38
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:30,000
currents being injected into that night and so it's really important that we understand how the noren transforms that

39
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:40,000
current import from other cells and from the sensory periphery into voltage changes that then change the behaviour of ion channels

40
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:50,000
that link of current Imports to voltage output is really crucial and that's why we're doing this experiment

41
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:00,000
ok and that's this point right here ok so one of the first things were going to see when we go through this analysis

42
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:10,000
is that Lauren's can perform analogue integration they can perform numerical integration over time that's pretty cool voltage

43
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:20,000
is that integral overtime of the injected current first order the simplest behaviour of in there so if you measure the voltage of Anna

44
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:30,000
can you turn on current and turn the current on the voltage of Anna on wall ramp up integrating that input overtime

45
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:40,000
sorry and see how that happens why that happens by physically OK come back on in the dish

46
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:50,000
let me just explain a little bit how you would actually do this experiment so these electrodes are little pieces of glass tubing so you take a fine glass tube about a millimetre across

47
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:00,000
hit up in the middle of a flame and you pull it apart when it melts in the middle and makes a very sharp Point Break off the final little

48
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:10,000
thread of glass that's left and you have a 2 that narrows down to a very short point but it's so tube and you can literally just there are some cells like

49
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:20,000
these people study large amount in in snails where the cells are millimetre across you can take it like her and literally just by hand poke it into the cell and then you feel that

50
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:30,000
can you fill that electrode with a salt solution and then you put a wire in the back of that electrode and you look it up to an amplifier now we want to measure the voltage in the

51
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:40,000
remember voltage is always voltage difference we're always measuring the difference between the voltage of one place and the voltage somewhere else so there's

52
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:50,000
car has two inputs it's called a differential amplifier and we're going to hook the the electro that's in the cell to the plus terminal we're going to put a wire in the bath

53
00:08:50,000 --> 00:09:00,000
the main is terminal and this amplifier is measuring the difference between the voltage inside the cell and the voltage outside the song any questions about them

54
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:10,000
the other other half of that piece of glass that we are pulled fill it with salt solution stick it in the cell and we can hook it up to a current source

55
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:20,000
horse is basically just a battery ok but it's got some fancy Electronics such that the current that flows is equal to whatever

56
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:30,000
you sat and remember that voltage is in units of volts and current is

57
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:40,000
charge per second charges coulomb's coulombs per second in that sequel to the unit of current which is amperes

58
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:50,000
nice take a closer look at our little microrna a little Nerang we've tapped all the dendrites and accents are so it's just a little spear

59
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:00,000
are you can basically model and Lauren just like any other cell as a spiritual Shell of insulating material

60
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:10,000
is a lipid bilayer this is a phospholipid bilayer phospholipids are just little a fat molecules that have a polar head on one side

61
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:20,000
is there a soluble in water on the side and they have a nonpolar tail so they don't like to be in contact with water and the two polar Tails go into NZ

62
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:30,000
sorry the nonpolar Tails go and to end the polar Heads face out into the water that make sense and they are very closely packed together

63
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:40,000
so that ions can pass through that membrane so it's insulating the it's very thin it's only about 23 angstroms across

64
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:50,000
an angstrom is a bath the size of a hydrogen atom

65
00:10:50,000 --> 00:11:00,000
ok we have sailing inside what is sailing what is what is it in our model number

66
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:10,000
on Tuesday good it's a wire and we have sailing outside which is also wire so we have two wires separated

67
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:20,000
insulator what is that good because it's separated by

68
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:30,000
ok so in an electrical component that behaves like a capacitor awake if you would have build one of those you would take

69
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:40,000
like a piece of alluminum foil put a piece of paper on it put another piece of alluminum foil next to it and attach wires to that and you would squeeze

70
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:50,000
stack of alluminum foil paper and eliminate well together and that becomes a capacitor as a symbol that looks like this electrically

71
00:11:50,000 --> 00:12:00,000
this is now or equivalent Circuit of this model they're on it's very simple it's a capacitor with one wire here

72
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:10,000
represents the inside of the song another wire that represents the outside of the song we have a current source

73
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:20,000
connect the outside of the cell to the inside of the cell when we turn on the current source it takes charges from inside of here and

74
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:30,000
sticks them through the electrode and pump them into the song this is our

75
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:40,000
this is sort of a simplified symbol for a voltage measuring device the voltage difference between the inside of the cell and the outside of the

76
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:50,000
is Notre measuring here and that difference is called the Membrane potential it's the voltage difference between the inside and the outside of the

77
00:12:50,000 --> 00:13:00,000
break any questions well time yes yes but we're going to do it one piece

78
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:10,000
start with a capacitor the resistor walk come in a few slides

79
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:20,000
exactly so with simplify

80
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:30,000
gonna answer that it's just an insulating Shell ok no I am channels no current anywhere else if we want to inject current into this

81
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:40,000
call Michael Moore on we have to inject it through this electrode here ok so we're just going down to the very simplest case

82
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:50,000
this is already kind of interesting enough to understand just buy it yes

83
00:13:50,000 --> 00:14:00,000
energy is stored in the electric field that crosses the bilayer and I'll get to that in the second

84
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:10,000
OK great question so what happens when you inject croniter in the run as I said the current source is pulling charges charges

85
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:20,000
outside and pumping them into the inside so what what happens when when

86
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:30,000
what happens when that goes on so what we're doing is we are injected currently this is our capacitor there are charges

87
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:40,000
there are ions on the inside that are just up against the inside of the cell membrane there are charges on the outside

88
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:50,000
and when we inject a charge from the outside to the inside let's put one of those charges right here and we're going to push it into the cell when you inject a charge

89
00:14:50,000 --> 00:15:00,000
you get an excess of charge on the inside of the cell membrane and what is that do you now have more positive charges

90
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:10,000
side than outside like charges repel so it pushes one of those charges away from the outside of the member

91
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:20,000
some make sense ok that's kind of interesting we took a charged with pushed it in

92
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:30,000
and eight Road comes out we have a current flowing we have charges coming in and charges leaving we have a

93
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:40,000
make flowing through an insulator how's that possible charges are actually passing through

94
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:50,000
the later but it looks like you have a current flowing that's called the capacitive current and we represent that in our diagram by Akon

95
00:15:50,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I subsea capacitive current that flows through the capacitor pretty cool right have a current flowing through an insulator that's what

96
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:10,000
ok now I noticed that you have a charge imbalance you have 3 positive charges here and only one

97
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:20,000
charge here so there is an excess of two positive charges on the inside that's because we added a positive charge to the inside and took away a positive charge from the outside

98
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Kings of charge in balance of two do you get between positive charge and a negative charge if you hold them next to each other what

99
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:40,000
is there a in between god we talked about

100
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:50,000
sing on a charge produces a force what is it an electric field between the positive the excess positive charges here and the

101
00:16:50,000 --> 00:17:00,000
negative charges here that's an electric field alright and that electric field stores entity how do you know there is energy in the sea

102
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:10,000
what can you do to demonstrate that there is an energy stored in it system you have two plates to metal plate

103
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:20,000
in the metal version of this separated by a an insulator what would happen if you pulled away the insulator those two things word

104
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:30,000
boom what is that take to make that sound energy ok

105
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:40,000
where is energy stored in an electric field is a charging balance there is an electric field what does an electric field over some distance correspond to

106
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:50,000
a voltage difference now there is a charging

107
00:17:50,000 --> 00:18:00,000
voltage difference and are proportional to each other so there is a proportionality constant that's called the capacitance

108
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:10,000
you can put a lot of charge and have a small voltage difference that's a big capacitor you can get a big capacitors by having a big area

109
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:20,000
you can have a lot of charges with a small voltage difference if you have big plates on your capacitor so that

110
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:30,000
is actually proportional to the area of the plates and it's inversely proportional to the distance between them it's a very thin membrane which means you can get

111
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:40,000
light of capacitance in it tiny area that's pretty cool any questions

112
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:50,000
stop charge is coulomb's in a 6 x 10 of the 18 charges in a Coolum elemental charges electronic

113
00:18:50,000 --> 00:19:00,000
chargers voltage is in units of volts and the capacitance is in units of ferrets

114
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:10,000
alright so we have our relation between voltage difference and charge difference and what we're going to do

115
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:20,000
is we're going to calculate this capacitive how do you think we would calculate the capacity of current

116
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:30,000
well the capacitive current is just the rate at which the charge imbalance is changing

117
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:40,000
current is just charge per unit time calculate the capacity of as the time rate of change of the charge and I've dropped

118
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Delta spirit capacitive current is security and remember that Q is just CV

119
00:19:50,000 --> 00:20:00,000
capacity of courage just cevdet and the VM here represent the Membrane potential so the capacitive current through a mm

120
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:10,000
is just the capacitance times the time rate of change of the Membrane potential

121
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:20,000
pretty straightforward know what we're going to do now we're going to relate the injected charge

122
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:30,000
sorry the injected current to the capacitor what does ChromeCast current Lotto lowest amount of current going into this wire has to be equal

123
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:40,000
leaving that wire so we can write that down as follows the difference in sign here is because the electric current is diff

124
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:50,000
positive inward the capacitive current is defined as positive outward

125
00:20:50,000 --> 00:21:00,000
OK so you can see that we just calculated the capacity of its CD

126
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:10,000
so we can just plug that in here and we see this very simple relation between the injected current and the voltage

127
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:20,000
gonna go in the Crown hazureta vampires which is coulomb's per second

128
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:30,000
ok so have that now we have a differential equation that describes the relation between current and voltage we can just integrate it to

129
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:40,000
the solution so that membrane potential will just be some initial membrane potential at x 0 +

130
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:50,000
one oversea Integra time of the injected current

131
00:21:50,000 --> 00:22:00,000
just integrate both sides you get me hear you get integral of I there and divide both sides by sea

132
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:10,000
any questions either really confusing or really obvious

133
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:20,000
alright good now what is this what is the integral of current overtime

134
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:30,000
it's the amount of charge you inject between x 0 and time tea and what is the what is the amount of charge you and

135
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:40,000
if I tell you that I injected in a mound of charge delta-q how much did I change the voltage

136
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Delta v is Delta Q oversee and that's exactly so so the voltage is just the starting voltage Plus

137
00:22:50,000 --> 00:23:00,000
don't make sense this integral here is just that part is just the amount of charge you in

138
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:10,000
/ see gives you the change in the fridge so the voltage is just the starring voltage plus Delta V

139
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:20,000
what's that because this equation here just came from

140
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:30,000
that was our charge or between charge and balance and voltage difference

141
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:40,000
it's not clear just please ask thank you ok then we go

142
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:50,000
what is the constant it's just some constant x time right so our voltage is just some

143
00:23:50,000 --> 00:24:00,000
show voltage plus the injected current oversee x time so you can see where this comes from right when you turn the car on on

144
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:10,000
voltage just increases linearly over time with a slope is given by the current / the capacitor

145
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:30,000
you guys are being very quiet at the point where I start feeling nervous I went to cast yes

146
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:40,000
yep yes it does and it breaks at about

147
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:50,000
a bolt result the electric field gets so strong it literally just rips the Adam's apart in the molecules of

148
00:24:50,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Violetta sorry I shouldn't say that it doesn't rip the Adam's of party ribs

149
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:10,000
the part you need much higher electric field to do that

150
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:20,000
oh because we're integrating from time 0 time t were measured we want to know the voltage at time t

151
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:30,000
ok we're starting at 0 or integrating the current from time 02 x t which is where were

152
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:40,000
you have to integrate the current from 0 to T3 can't use tea in here tears tears that endpoint

153
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:50,000
that make sense good question thank you

154
00:25:50,000 --> 00:26:00,000
ok everybody alright I'm going to stand here and tell her one more question yes

155
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:10,000
oh here because current of value I not great question

156
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:20,000
yeah that's right this ok I should have maybe been more clear

157
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:30,000
is current source has a novel set I get to I get to like that you guys there would be an app now and I brought my my current source

158
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:40,000
how can I type in 10 million room and there's things there's a Bluetooth connection to this thing and he likes at this thing to 10 million and it just keeps pumping 10 milliamps until you

159
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:50,000
to do something else ok

160
00:26:50,000 --> 00:27:00,000
oh ok sure what would that be actually if you put in a linear graph and current

161
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:10,000
b a parabolic voltage profile exactly it this current profile that you this voltage profile

162
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:20,000
literally just the numerical integral of this function so all you have to do is look at there's an integrated in your head and you can see what the voltage does

163
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:30,000
great that's exactly right so let's do another example this put in a bolt our current pulse so we started 0 currently step it up to I not we hold it

164
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:40,000
how do we turn the current off so let's start owner on right here what's going to happen what's what's your name I'm going to ask you to do this

165
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Sammy WhatsApp this voltage going to do good cos it's your current then what's going to happen

166
00:27:50,000 --> 00:28:00,000
good good

167
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:10,000
if that's simple good right now song

168
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:20,000
resistors who brought up iron conductances somebody somebody mentioned that so that's the next thing we're going to add this

169
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:30,000
zero-order mall of anora the simplest view and it's are often not so bad for short periods of time

170
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:40,000
but I actually have ion channels that allow current to flow through the Membrane so we're gonna start today by analysing the case of the simplest

171
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I am channel which is the kind of ion channel when you take a needle in your pocket Hole In The Membrane ok it's called the leak

172
00:28:50,000 --> 00:29:00,000
and organise what armour on days when you do that so what we're going to find is that the iron

173
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:10,000
the elite conductance can be represented in a model simply by a resistor and we're going to

174
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:20,000
are capacitive current membrane capacitive cart and a membrane ionic current that's due to ions flowing through ion channels in the Membrane

175
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:30,000
ok and that current will be we're going to call that are leak resistance and that car

176
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:40,000
will be a leak current so now it's current lighthouses what that the liquor

177
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:50,000
plus the capacity of call the injected current

178
00:29:50,000 --> 00:30:00,000
we know the capacity of current is just CDT so we just put that in now we have I link + CDT = the injected Electro

179
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:10,000
that is called membrane ionic current that is called membrane capacitive current and that is our electrical

180
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:20,000
there is a sign convention in neuroscience which is that membrane ionic currents that are outward

181
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:30,000
inside of the cell to the outside of the cell membrane are positive in sign positive charges leaving the cell have a positive sign

182
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:40,000
just convention could have been the other way but you have to choose something so that's what I think it was actually who

183
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:50,000
decided that it's positive charges entering the cells through the Membrane going this way from extracellular to intracellular are defined as negative

184
00:30:50,000 --> 00:31:00,000
electric currency other electric inward current is pot into the cell is positive

185
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:10,000
ok so we're gonna go membrane and we're going tomorrow that I am channel using Ohm's law so the leak

186
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:20,000
is just membrane potential / resistance leak resistance

187
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:30,000
what do we get if we plug this into a I link bus capacitance capacitive equals injector current we get v membrane potential

188
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:40,000
over R L + EDT = injected car remote

189
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:50,000
sides by resistance we get very pass RC for it's called an RC model DVD t

190
00:31:50,000 --> 00:32:00,000
lick resistance times the injected current alright looking a little complicated but we're gonna simplify

191
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:10,000
RC is resistance times capacitance in a turns out that has units of time and sore

192
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:20,000
call that got a little ahead of myself that's called towel we're going to make that substitution in a minute but first we're going to

193
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:30,000
delete the Steady State solution to the equation cancel bear with me hang on it's all going to make sense in a minute

194
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:40,000
is anyone I to calculate the Steady State solution of a difference equation yes got what's your name

195
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:50,000
so you set the derivative so let's do that set delete equal to zero and what do you find

196
00:32:50,000 --> 00:33:00,000
sorry flash the answer of what what do you get if you said DVD to equal zero good so

197
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:10,000
you and Jack some current we're going to hold the current constant Bugsy put some current in and we hold it constant the voltage

198
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:20,000
an eventually things will settle down in the divinity we'll go to zero point we know the voltage it's just our

199
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:30,000
* i.e. what is equals resistance times current what is that it's just

200
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:40,000
when we inject current bunch of stuff happens and when the dust settles the voltage difference is just

201
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:50,000
injector current / resistance

202
00:33:50,000 --> 00:34:00,000
well right now we just took a needle and poked a hole in her cell so

203
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:10,000
exactly it's how big the hole it now sells real cells do have leaked channels there actually

204
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:20,000
ion channels that leak can any iron it's in there it's it's not very common and you'll see why in a minute

205
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:30,000
actually it's not quite true there are ion channels that that look essentially like

206
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:40,000
leeks and it turns out that the ion channels that many neurotransmitter receptors like

207
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:50,000
and acetylcholine the ion channels actually look like little leaks they pass multiple ions that makes them look like

208
00:34:50,000 --> 00:35:00,000
ok so instead he stayed the memory potential ghost r l

209
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:10,000
* ID and we call that voltage something special the infinity because it's the voltage that the system reaches

210
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:20,000
time equals Infinity questions about that ok

211
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:30,000
make this equation as BM + 80 = the infinity and that equation we're going to see over and

212
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:40,000
ran over again in this class in many different contacts it's a first order linear differential equation it's very powerful

213
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I want you to get used to it so what what is this mean so let's rewrite this equation a little bit let's

214
00:35:50,000 --> 00:36:00,000
best time to the other side and divide both sides by towel in Hurstville to get DVD t = -1 over tile V -

215
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:10,000
what time is v minus the infinity now let's take a look at what the derivative

216
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:20,000
he looks like as a function of voltage yes

217
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:30,000
the infinity is defined r l x i e a definition sorry I should have put

218
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:40,000
three three lines there to indicate that it's the definition of sorry that that's a very important question what's your name

219
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:50,000
OK I'm going to make an attempt to remember names so is everyone clear about that the infinity is

220
00:36:50,000 --> 00:37:00,000
find as the resistance x lists injected current so be injected current when we inject current into another on your changing

221
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Trinity your controlling it that make sense ok so

222
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:20,000
let's look at how the derivative changes as a function of voltage it's very simple with me all this is going to crystallize in your mind in one beautiful country

223
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:30,000
very shortly resistance times capacitance has

224
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:40,000
units time ok answer we call it towel towel is just a constant ok so hang on bare with me

225
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:50,000
the derivative is a devoted and add v = v Infinity the derivative is 0

226
00:37:50,000 --> 00:38:00,000
that's the definition of the infinity at the voltage at which the derivative is 0

227
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:10,000
the voltage is less than the infinity the derivative is

228
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:20,000
is positive right when the voltage is below the infinity the derivative of voltage is positive so what is what is the voltage doing

229
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:30,000
it's approaching the infinity if the voltage is above the infinity voltage greater than the infinity the derivative is

230
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:40,000
negative voltage does white approaches the infinity so no matter where a voltage is

231
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:50,000
how is approaching the infinity if it's below the slope is positive in it approaches me infinity if it's above the infinity the slippers

232
00:38:50,000 --> 00:39:00,000
it approaches the infinity From Above So is always just relaxing toward the infinity

233
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:10,000
how does it get there does it go linearly well you can see that the slope the rate at which it approaches me infinity is proportional to how far away it is from here

234
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:20,000
it so it doesn't crash into the infinity it kind of slowly approaches be Infinity

235
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:30,000
let me know what that function is called it's an exponential good

236
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:40,000
and it has a it approaches with a timescale of town so with our small it approaches quickly

237
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:50,000
if how is long it approaches see that if how is big the derivatives are small if Towers small the derivatives

238
00:39:50,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Brett

239
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:10,000
any questions about that sorry say it again yes

240
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:20,000
at time towel at time towel 8 x 0

241
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:30,000
difference between the infinity sav and the infinity is the night - be Infinity at time towel that initial difference drops by about 1/3

242
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:40,000
but one of the ear I think it's 2.7 something ok so in one towel this voltage difference Falls by about it drops by about it

243
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:50,000
and then another Tower drops by another keeps going let's just wait

244
00:40:50,000 --> 00:41:00,000
general solution the general solution for the case where you have constant current that

245
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:10,000
difference from the voltage of time t2b infinity is just equal to the initial voltage difference x eater the minor steel guitar

246
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:20,000
ftz photo then this is either the minus 1

247
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:30,000
so the voltage difference will be one third of the original voltage difference ok looks like

248
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:40,000
we have a work we have another on we have a current pulse we we have 0 current we turn the current onto I not at this time we hold

249
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:50,000
constant and return the current at this time radio what what does the voltage do let's go step

250
00:41:50,000 --> 00:42:00,000
the first thing is that voltage sorry the current controls what in that equation

251
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Crows v the infinity so we can plot the infinity immediately because the infinity is just the resistance times the injected current so what is the infinity

252
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:20,000
it's constant here and then what happens to the infinity

253
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:30,000
recess that's correct but got it will just be the resistance times the current resistance is a constants of the infinity War just go up

254
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:40,000
good up and then it stays constant at our times I and

255
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:50,000
at this point the current goes back at zero so the infinity is resistance x zero so the infinity drops back to 0

256
00:42:50,000 --> 00:43:00,000
that makes sense that's the infinity that's not the voltage of the song that's the steady-state voltage of the song

257
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:10,000
so now what does voltage of the Sower actually do so let's start our voltage here

258
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:20,000
0 what happens good what is it doing

259
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:30,000
it approaches salt v at every point is relaxing toward the infinity exponentially

260
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:40,000
raped and that looks like it was some time constant and that looks like this alright

261
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:50,000
happens here good because the infinity is suddenly changed 20 and sobey relaxes toward the infinity

262
00:43:50,000 --> 00:44:00,000
financially with some time constant

263
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:10,000
any questions ok

264
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:20,000
now this that is RC model drug resistance x

265
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:30,000
is the colour resistor in a capacitor is the solutions artist exponential decay stored some Steady State solution

266
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:40,000
it turns out that an RC system a first order linear system acts like

267
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:50,000
ok so remember our armour on the just has a capacitor is an integrator integrates over time when you add a resistor

268
00:44:50,000 --> 00:45:00,000
this thing is it's kind of integrating here but then it gets tired and stops in a grating it relaxes to some Steady State

269
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:10,000
actually looks like a filter it takes time to respond to something

270
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:20,000
that system responds well to things that are changing slowly and time and respond very weekly to things that are changing

271
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:30,000
and time so he has to go through this demonstration in red is the injected current so if you have a long pulses

272
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:40,000
actor current the time constant of this morning is about 10 Ms I think this is probably a where is that a 50 or 100 mil second pulse

273
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:50,000
any casino in blue is the voltage it relaxes toward the infinity and then the current goes off it relaxes

274
00:45:50,000 --> 00:46:00,000
you can see that the voltage is responding very well to the current injection now it's make really short pulse that are much shorter than

275
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:10,000
you can see that the better voltage touch relaxing toward the infinity but it doesn't get very far and also the currents turned off and it relaxes

276
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:20,000
it's only compliant the peak voltage response as a function of the width of these pulses and you can see that for long pulses it responds

277
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:30,000
but for short pulses where response at all and that's called a low-pass filter it responds well to

278
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:40,000
only changing things but barely responds to rapidly changing so it's passing low frequencies low pass filter

279
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:50,000
any questions that was a lot of stuff I once yet

280
00:46:50,000 --> 00:47:00,000
ok it's 10 per square centimetre

281
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:10,000
coronavirus Perth per square metre that's a great question what the actual numbers

282
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:20,000
coronavirus I think you had a question sorry say it again

283
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:30,000
what happens is it react to it but because it's changing kind of linearly at this short times it doesn't get

284
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:40,000
if the current stays on for a long time you can see it is exactly the same profile here but it just has time to reach the infinity here it doesn't have time to reach

285
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:50,000
get a little bit away from 0 and then it decays back yes

286
00:47:50,000 --> 00:48:00,000
you can build different kinds of filters from Circuit signals but no one's themselves tend to be

287
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:10,000
hyper you can low pass filter you can make so you can put in different kinds

288
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:20,000
channels that the change the properties of Lawrence by 3rd of the 1st order you should think of nerds as low pass filters

289
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:30,000
yeah

290
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:40,000
I wrote it like this you can write his vehicles the infinity plus this other stuff but I wrote it like this because what you should really be seeing here is that

291
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:50,000
voltage difference from time between the voltage and and the infinity decays exponentially so the distance you are from

292
00:48:50,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Infinity decays exponentially it makes it more obvious that you're decaying toward

293
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:10,000
the infinity

294
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:20,000
not not really not simply you can

295
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:30,000
put in certain ion channels that that could make a nor on less responsive at low frequencies

296
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:40,000
OK so you can make them kind of responsive to some middle range of frequencies they're won't respond to very high frequencies in they won't respond much to

297
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:50,000
very low frequency is but but for the most part again just you should at this point let's just think of them as as low pass filters

298
00:49:50,000 --> 00:50:00,000
what can I start adding fancy stuffed armour on it's going to make it more complicated so don't get too high

299
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:10,000
alright let me just make this point Parade hero vehicles was being

300
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:20,000
appears everywhere is ubiquitous in physics chemistry biology will be using it multiple different

301
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:30,000
in different parts of the class and even

302
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:40,000
slightly more complicated versions of this like the michelis meant in equations in in chemistry you know you can kind of understand them and simple term

303
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:50,000
you have a handle on this other slightly more complicated things become much more intuitive

304
00:50:50,000 --> 00:51:00,000
trader trader really make sure that you understand this the situation and how we derived it

305
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:10,000
OK let's talk about the origin of this the time scale of a non so that tower vandoren a motorised is about

306
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:20,000
100 Ms to 10 Ms to 100 Ms going to be in that range and it comes from the values of resistance and capacitance of Andorra

307
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:30,000
resistor the resistance of a normal range of 100 million Oz

308
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:40,000
capacitance of the -10 ohms or about 100 of those two things to do

309
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:50,000
get a Time cast of about about 10 Ms so what that means if you inject current into another on it

310
00:51:50,000 --> 00:52:00,000
about 10 to 100 seconds for it to fully respond to that step of current-voltage jump up

311
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Max 2 the movie infinity in about 10 to 100 Ms let's take a little bit cos he'd look at the resistance what this

312
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:20,000
sensor capacitance looks like in anora so we've describe that relation between current and voltage

313
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:30,000
as current equals voltage over resistance but rather than using resistance to think about current flow

314
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:40,000
remember rain it's much more used for usually to think about something called conductance and conductance is just one over resistance

315
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Dr g and where's the symbol G4 conductance is equal to Nova resistance so now we can write Ohm's law as i = g x b

316
00:52:50,000 --> 00:53:00,000
resistance has unit of arms g conductances units of inverse arms or Siemens is the si

317
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:10,000
conductance so if we have to if we have to let it to ion channels in the Membrane

318
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:20,000
they operate in parallel current flows through them separately right they're not in series like it close to 1 and then flows through the other they

319
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:30,000
are in parallel current can flow through both like this up in parallel and we can write down the current using curry

320
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:40,000
why the total current is just the sum of the current through those two separate conductances right now the total current is we can just expand this in

321
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:50,000
the conductance of each one of those so the total current is G1 the voltage x the voltage difference plus G2

322
00:53:50,000 --> 00:54:00,000
voltage difference for this conductance so the total current is just the fact about the v the total current is just G1 + G2

323
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:10,000
we can write down the total conductances just g 1 plus due to make sense inductances in parallel

324
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:20,000
together member in this got some ion channels in it or holes and we add another

325
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:30,000
the Membrane that kind of has the same density of ion channels you have wiped the holes twice the current and twice the conductance

326
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:40,000
so we can write the current as conductance x membrane potential but we can rewrite that conductance as

327
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:50,000
area x the conductance per unit area and that's called specific membrane conductance in this case it's a leak so we can't specifically

328
00:54:50,000 --> 00:55:00,000
send it has units of conductance per area we multiply that by the area and

329
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:10,000
that total conduct about this

330
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:20,000
so you can see that we can now plot the current through the Membrane as a

331
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:30,000
up voltage this is called at current but it as a function of voltage you can see that the current is linear as a function of

332
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:40,000
that's just owns law and you can see that for a low conductance g is small for the slope of small Bahai conductance

333
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:50,000
you get a lot of current for a little bit of voltage and so the people so if you part current v voltage you get a car and the slope of that

334
00:55:50,000 --> 00:56:00,000
is just equal to the conductance

335
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:10,000
total current through these two capacitors in parallel is just the current through want masterplus the current through the other we can write the current through each

336
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:20,000
separately I told her = c 1 DVD + c 2 DVD tea and you get the total current it's just see one

337
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:30,000
to DVD so the total capacitance the sum of the capacitance is so if you have a patch of membrane you measure the capacitance if you put it

338
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:40,000
next to it you'll get the some of those two capacitance the capacitance also scales with area so weak

339
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:50,000
play down the total membrane capacitance as capacitance per unit area times the area of the cell

340
00:56:50,000 --> 00:57:00,000
the area of a salad do you like to put it's a sphere is 4 pi r squared where is the radius

341
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:10,000
is that this see some am is called this specific membrane capacitance and it's 10 nanofarads per square metre

342
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:20,000
ok now I want to show you something really cool we have a cell that has a membrane with some that had the cell has some time

343
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:30,000
remember 10 Ms over the the capacitance of the cell depends on how big it is right and so that

344
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:40,000
constant will change depending on how big the salad you might think that actually calculate the time constant from this capacitance and

345
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:50,000
inductance ok so here we go our is just one over the conductance right so the time can't sit

346
00:57:50,000 --> 00:58:00,000
consonance / conductance capacitance / total conductance but you can rewrite this capacitors capacitance per unit area

347
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:10,000
* area can rewrite that conductances as conductance per unit area times the area of the song and the areas cancel

348
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:20,000
and so that meant that I'm can't see it is just that capacity per unit area of the Membrane / the conductance per unit area of the Membrane

349
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:30,000
that means is that the time constant of a cell nothing to do with the song the time constant is the Membrane time can't answer proper

350
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:40,000
only of the Membrane that's pretty cool right

351
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:50,000
questions birthday

352
00:58:50,000 --> 00:59:00,000
now in a more complicated moron or you have a Soma and dendrite and accents

353
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:10,000
parts of the cell can have different conductance per unit area like more ion channels out here on the dendrite and maybe if you were on

354
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:20,000
one part of a cell can have a different membrane time constant than some other part of the song but again

355
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:30,000
pretty of the number

356
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:40,000
slow between absolutely that's one of that in

357
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:50,000
things about cells have multiple that have different properties you have current flowing between them but you have to understand this kind of

358
00:59:50,000 --> 01:00:00,000
start before you even get anywhere close to understanding and more complicated mirror ok

359
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:10,000
so we're going to add a new component to our model it's a battery and it's going to solve 1

360
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:20,000
really fetal problem with this model what what's the problem with this model can anyone see I'm kind of show

361
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:30,000
ratio what happens to this now on if I turn the current off

362
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:40,000
it goes back to 0 and in order to get the voltage go different from zero I have to in

363
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:50,000
current through my current source without me the experimental with an electrode in it injecting current this moron literally just sit at zero

364
01:00:50,000 --> 01:01:00,000
and stays there right it's actually a good model of a dead Nora

365
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:10,000
change that when you Dad about it and that batter is going to

366
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:20,000
play The Sting up so now it can change its own voltage and then things start getting really interesting so how

367
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:30,000
what is batteries allow an Iran to change its own voltage well the way nor on controls its own voltage is it has ion channels conductor

368
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:40,000
that have little knobs on them that the cell can control car voltage so these

369
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:50,000
conductances are voltage dependent and now the South Burnett biz batteries to it's inside wire at different times

370
01:01:50,000 --> 01:02:00,000
so let's say we want to make an action potential do we have a battery that's got a positive voltage do you have a battery that's got a negative voltage and we make an app

371
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:10,000
potential by connecting the back to the inside of the cell by turning on this conductance and then we're going to connect

372
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:20,000
the battery with a negative voltage to RSL and we're going to do that one after the other so much this

373
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:30,000
connect the positive battery and the voltage is going to go up or going to turn off the positive battery connect the negative battery the voltage goes down and then we're going to

374
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:40,000
both batteries in the voltage relaxes so now they can control

375
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:50,000
control it on voltage but before we do that we need to put batteries in an Aurora

376
01:02:50,000 --> 01:03:00,000
anybody know what to press

377
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:10,000
but we're gonna get to that that was back next question what what what is it that makes a batter in or on

378
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:20,000
go to the rest of the election

379
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:30,000
that's exactly right concentration gradients there is one more thing we need concentration gradients by

380
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:40,000
how's don't do it we need ion channels that are permeable only to certain ions that so we're going to do now

381
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:50,000
so you need concentration gradients and selective permeability so we're going to go through that so let's take a beaker

382
01:03:50,000 --> 01:04:00,000
salt with water have a membrane dividing into two we're gonna have an electrode on one side we measure the voltage difference so we have an electron and

383
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:10,000
we hook it up to a differential amplifier and measure the sun the two sides ok then we're going to

384
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Rihanna Taka we're going to buy some potassium chloride from Sigma and take a spoon

385
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:30,000
and dump it into the side of the Beaker it up and now you're going to have lots of potassium ions and chloride ions on this side of the bigger

386
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:40,000
now we're going to take a needle and poke a hole in that membrane that becomes a leak a leak channel

387
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:50,000
1/9 is a nonspecific a non-selective poor the passes any iron so what's

388
01:04:50,000 --> 01:05:00,000
the ions are going to defuse

389
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:10,000
where to where somebody else from here

390
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:20,000
let's focus on potassium now we're going to plant we can plot the potassium concentration on this side of the time and this side Overtime by the way

391
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Blade of the Beaker is going to represent the brand which has lots of potassium and this is going to represent the outside of her and which has very little potassium

392
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:40,000
so if we took that that potassium concentration on this side it's going to increase over time is going to take along the end and the concentration

393
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:50,000
decrease in eventually Bell meet in the middle somewhere because

394
01:05:50,000 --> 01:06:00,000
a long time for this half of the spoon for potassium chloride to defuse to the other side ok

395
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:10,000
I'm now let's get up different kind of needle a very special needle that's really small

396
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:20,000
and poker Hole In The Membrane that is only big enough to pass potassium ions but not chloride ions

397
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:30,000
what's going to happen now

398
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:40,000
yes good good so

399
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:50,000
some potassium ions are going to defuse through this poor and go to the other side and what's going to happen is it

400
01:06:50,000 --> 01:07:00,000
the potassium concentration here it will decrease sorry over here what increase a little bit and the potassium concentration on the side will decrease a little bit

401
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:10,000
what time it will stop changing and it will never come to equal also take a very short time for that equilibrium to happen because just

402
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:20,000
potassium ions need to go to the other side before it stops so stop changing here well it's because

403
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:30,000
potassium current from their side to the side post-2020 very quickly

404
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:40,000
so why is that well one hint to the

405
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:50,000
do that question comes if we look at the voltage difference between the two sides what you see is it the voltage different started it 0

406
01:07:50,000 --> 01:08:00,000
and when we parked at home all of a sudden there is a rapidly developing voltage difference across the two sides

407
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:10,000
a why why does that maltage go negative

408
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:20,000
what what happened when is positive charges started diffusing from the side to the site

409
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:30,000
basically this is like a capacitor right and we some treasures diffused

410
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:40,000
you're a to hear some positive charges diffused from here to hear that charges up the side and so the voltage is positive we put positive chart more positive

411
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:50,000
is there the voltage air goes up so

412
01:08:50,000 --> 01:09:00,000
if the voltage here is higher than voltage here were planning V1 - V2 the voltage here is lower than

413
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:10,000
voltage here and so this is going negative and that

414
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:20,000
message difference that negative voltage here positive voltage here what is that do it repels and makes the positive side

415
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:30,000
repelling which ions and positive ions heaps more potassium ions from diffuser

416
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:40,000
through the hole that make sense

417
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:50,000
do you like bikes there's a real good and it continue

418
01:09:50,000 --> 01:10:00,000
up until equal reaches a constant voltage and that's called the equilibrium potential changes in equilibrium and that

419
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:10,000
France is called the equilibrium potential and that voltage difference is a battery

420
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:20,000
and I'm going to explain a little bit I think it's in the next like sure that the one that's on tape that explains how you actually

421
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:30,000
justify representing that is a battery but right now I'm going to show you how to calculate what that voltage difference actually is what's this

422
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:40,000
the battery how big is the battery so you can see that when ions positive ions diffuse to the side this voltage go

423
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:50,000
do you have a voltage gradient that corresponds to the field pointing in this direction and that electric field pushes against the iron swim

424
01:10:50,000 --> 01:11:00,000
what we talked about drift and electric field so when those ions are trying to defuse a cross that Electric Feel This literally dragging them back to this site

425
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:10,000
right so we have a we have a current flowing this way from diffusion and we have a current flowing

426
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:20,000
way from being dragged in the electric field so we can calculate voltage difference because

427
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:30,000
collabrium the current flowing this way from diffusion has the current flowing that way from drift in an electric field

428
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:40,000
ok so one way to calculate this is we're going to calculate the current due to drift current to the diffusion of those up and

429
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:50,000
go to the total and an equilibrium that has two equal to 0 so so I'm what I'm showing you now

430
01:11:50,000 --> 01:12:00,000
sort of the framework for how you would calculate this using this drift and diffusion equation do we have

431
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Ohm's law that tells us how the voltage difference produces a current to the drift and we have fixed law that tells us how to

432
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:20,000
is duded diffusion and you can set the sum of those two things to equal 0 alright

433
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:30,000
so this is the way you would like I don't expect you to follow anything on the slide just accept the see that it can be done this way ok so

434
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:40,000
don't even have to write this down ok so the drift current is proportionate some constant x voltage

435
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:50,000
fix light is some constant times that concentration gradients remember that we just sent those two things equal and solve for delta

436
01:12:50,000 --> 01:13:00,000
and that's what you find what you find is the Delta v is just some constant x the log of the difference in concentrations on the inside and outside

437
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:10,000
turns out there's a way of calculating this that's much simpler and more elegant and I'm going to show you

438
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:20,000
that calculation yes yes at the beginning

439
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:30,000
the answer is that the concentrations don't change through this process so you can even ignore that change night everybody

440
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:40,000
gatis tell us how we're going to calculate an alternative way of calculating this voltage difference just really beautiful

441
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:50,000
the boltzmann equation the boltzmann equation to the probability of a particle being in two States as a function of the

442
01:13:50,000 --> 01:14:00,000
difference between us two states and one of those States is going to correspond to a particle being on the left side of the bigger or inside of herself and that particle beam

443
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:10,000
outside of a cell or on the other side of the bigger than those two left side in right side have different energies ok sorry system has

444
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:20,000
States 100 state and a low energy state boltzmann equation to assess the probability of being a state 1 / the probability of being in state to is just

445
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:30,000
play the minus energy difference / Katie the Bosman constant temperature at the same Katy that we talked about

446
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:40,000
now you can see if the temperature is very low all those particles are if the temperature is 0 they're not being Josh

447
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:50,000
I'm just sitting there quietly can't get into state wine they just sit in state to state

448
01:14:50,000 --> 01:15:00,000
play the probability of being a stick 2800 this is a very big number either the - big number is 0

449
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:10,000
now that's it we hit things up a bit so they're Now Katie gets big so the Katie actually

450
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:20,000
approximately the same size as the energy difference between the two States so now some of those particles can get jostled over into

451
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:30,000
state want and we can write down we can just calculate you can see now that the

452
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:40,000
studying being in step 1 is divided by the probability of in situ is bigger than zero now you can actually just calculated if the energy difference is just

453
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Kitty than energy difference to Kati Kati the pound that Rachel probabilities is just eater 2 - 2

454
01:15:50,000 --> 01:16:00,000
if the energy difference is bigger than you can see the that probability ratio smaller the problem

455
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:10,000
things that one goes to 0 if you increase that and you make that energy difference very small at temperature Katie you see that

456
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:20,000
if the energy difference is about the same as Katie than the probability of being a state 1 is equal to the probability and stay to those those particles just jostle back and forth between

457
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:30,000
2 States ok it's already to do this probabilities is the minor Sanity difference over Katy what's the energy of a particle here

458
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:40,000
here well that's a charged particle the energy difference is just given by the voltage difference so it is charge times voltage work use the charge

459
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:50,000
ratio of probabilities is q x voltage difference over Katy

460
01:16:50,000 --> 01:17:00,000
take the log of both sides solve for the voltage difference VN - VL = - Katie over q x the log of the probability ratio

461
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:10,000
what the probability is just concentration and so we can write this as Delta v The Voice

462
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:20,000
difference is equal to 80 over Q which is 25 ml bolts times the log of the ratio of potassium currents

463
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:30,000
outside to potassium concentration inside and that's exactly the same equation that we get if you do that much more complicated

464
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:40,000
derivation based on fix law and balancing fixed line on spot and this is

465
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Skyrim potential here not electric field ok so let's take a look at potassium concentrations in a real cell there's actually from school

466
01:17:50,000 --> 01:18:00,000
400mm inside 20mm outside so there's a lot of potassium inside of a cell not very much outside

467
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:10,000
doesn't or equation Katie of accused 25 temperature at room temperature log of that concentration ratio is

468
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:20,000
3 so EK is -75 Melbourne start with a lot of potassium inside of a cell open up a potassium selective

469
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:30,000
what happened diffusers out to the channel and the voltage goes to -75 novels

470
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:40,000
how do you know it's negative like I always can't remember whether this is concentration inside or outside outside or inside I don't know but the point is you don't actually

471
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:50,000
because you can just look at it and see the answer what sign it is if you have positive ions high concentration of positive ions inside they defuse

472
01:18:50,000 --> 01:19:00,000
the voltage inside of the cell when positive ions leave is going to do what it's going to go down so that's

473
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:10,000
- salt battery and in those video models that I recorded for you it's going to

474
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:20,000
how you actually incorporate that into a a battery in our Circuit model and so we've done all these things we looked at how membrane capacitance and

475
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:30,000
stencil hours Mirage to integrate over time we've learnt how to write down the difference equations were now able to just look at a car import and figure out the voltage

476
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:40,000
and we now understand where the batteries in Iraq come from
