 ok good morning everybody the we're going to continue today developing a model of again this is called the equivalent Circuit model in it was developed by Alan Hart Huxley in the 40s and 50s give a brief recap of what we've covered in the last couple so weapon analysing a n or an with an imagining a an experiment in which we have a nor on in a dish Northwest extracellular solution which is a salt solution we have a electrode in the cell that's measuring the voltage difference between inside in the outside of the salsa we have the electrode connected to an amplifier a different lamprophyre and a wire in the bath connected to the other side and we have a current source which are injects current into the cell and we imagine that as the experimenter we have our a knob that we can adjust the amount of current that's been injected into the south we describe the ne on basically as a capacitor because it it's 2 conductors separated by an insulator so we have a conductor one conductor inside the cell which is the conductive intracellular salts another conductor outside the south which is the conductive extracellular solution and those two conductors are separated by an insulator which is a fast forward down the equivalent Circuit for this which for this situation right here it has a voltage measure device that represents the Membrane potential as the difference between the intracellular voltage and the extracellular bolted voltage we have sorry is here and we've represented owner on so far as a capacitor then introduce the idea of channels are conductances of pores in the Membrane that allow ions to pass through the Membrane through this little pores and we describe the eyes we talked about the idea that there are many different kinds of ions ion channels that have different interesting prop so with an extended our analysis of an Iran in the dish to include these ion channels down by putting by representing ion channels as a resistance that connects the intracellular space in the extracellular space this sister is in parallel with our capacitor and we represented the current going through that resistance which we called the leak resistance art we represented the current as a leak current Isa Bell are noted that we were going are all this week resistance using Ohm's law so we wrote down that current that leak current as the Membrane potential v device by the leak resistance this is just Onslow and we also rewrote are the quality one over R1 over the resistance as the leak conductance so delete current is just delete conductance time's the Membrane potential also introduced the idea of an IV curve which plots the amount of current flowing through this through our leak conductance as a function of the Membrane potential is v and for the case of a resistor for the case for modelling Elite conductance with Ohm's law that the current as a function of voltage is a straight line going through the origin whose slope is just we conducted questions about that ok then we derive the simply quote for how The Membrane potential evolves over time as a function of the injected current and we did that using kirkovski I would says that the sum of all the currents into a node has two equal the sum of currents out of a node or node here means a wire tell the some of these currencies = 0 is a minus sign here because this current the electrode injected current as time does positive going into the cell and these currents are to find a positive when they go out of the south substituted for current the expression from Onslow so into this part of the equation here this term we substitute VM over arse about can I apologise for the slight inconsistency in notation here sometimes I'm using VM and sometimes I'm using v altrider fix that boat VR miss the same as v and in what you've seen so far and we also have an expression here for the capacitive current capacity capacity of current through this capacitor is just CDT the we put those two expressions those substitutions and we have this expression are that relates the voltage in the cell to the injected current weary wrote this a little bit by multiplying by the leak resistance and we are rewrote this again making a couple substitutions we use how are in place of RC so that becomes a time constant and the infinity is this expression on the right are leak the injected current so the equation that we now have the differential equation that we now have for the dependence of the Membrane potential on injected current looks like we pass powder VT is equal to the infinity when we inject current into the cell or changing the infinity and then the voltage evolves as described by this different workwear Asian alright so we're going to plot a bunch of things the infinity and the voltage in the as we interact the pulse of currents are we start out with injected current equal to 0 with Step Up 2 I not hold a car injector current I not for some period of time and then reset the current back to 0 so what does the infinity do as a function of time anybody remember it does the same thing but pied by our saval very good ok and what does what does the Membrane potential do so let's start the Membrane potential is 0 starting here what does the Membrane potential do as a function of what's your name yes there's a 0 good it what's the what say how do we say exponentially toward the infinity very good so it relaxes exponentially toward the infinity which is here and then what happens and it does it relaxes with a time constant of RC and what that means is that the time it takes for the one over ear bits original distance from the infinity is is given by towel and you can solve this differential equation that was on the previous slide for periods worthy inject is constant where the infinity is constant and what you can see is that the voltage difference from the current v Infinity relaxes sleep 20 boats out at the initial voltage minus the infinity and you multiply that difference times and the Dickies 20 and so the voltage difference between the voltage and the Infinity the game we are we then introduced the idea that Lauren's have batteries where do the batteries of Anna Ron come from anybody remember Stacey I Remember You the batteries of an Iran come from that's what the battery producers the battery producers of voltage difference but by physically what causes that voltage different ion selective pours good that's one component and there's another important component somewhere else want to answer but excellent so we components ion concentration gradients and ion selective pours so basically if you have a high concentration of ask him inside the cell when you open up a potassium selective ion channel the potassium ions diffuse out of the cell an excess of negative charges inside the cell that causes the voltage inside the cell to go down until there is a sufficient voltage gradient that the drift of potassium ions back into the cell driven by the voltage gradient is equal to the diffusion read of ions out of the cell produced by the protected by the concentration gradient OK at equilibrium at the equilibrium potential there is a particular voltage at which there's no net current into potassium current into or out of the cell ok and that's what we mean by equilibrium potential otherwise known as the nernst potential last time we derive the nurse potential using the ball equation we are the boltzmann equation gives us the ratio of the probability of finding an iron inside or outside of the South and that's equal to eat to the minus energy difference of an ion inside and outside of the cells / Katie the energy difference is given by the how much time is the voltage difference to charge of the ion that were considering x the voltage difference so we took the log of both sides of four VN - and we found that the voltage difference at equilibrium this is at thermal equilibrium that's what the boltzmann equation tells us at thermal equilibrium what's the ratio abilities at thermal equilibrium and the voltage difference is 25 ml bolts x the log the natural log of the concentration of freshens and that's ok is the if you put in the the the potassium concentrations here that give equilibrium potential for potassium or the north potential for potassium so so Iran's here on earth are kinda like it's on that caesium irons on the alien planet potassium potassium sensation inside of a cell is around 400 mm and I think this is for squid giant axon she's a little bit earlier but yes guy so so if about the probability of finding a potassium ion inside of a cell and finding a potassium ion outside the ratio of probabilities is going to be proportional to the ratio of concentrations does that make sense ok so given these concentrations a high concentration of positive potassium ions inside the cell a low outside the cell we can take the ratio of those concentrations take the natural log of that that's about 3 log units the sign is negative because this is this ratio is smaller than 1 so the equilibrium potential for potassium that's about 25 waltz Katie of acute for a monovalent is $25 volts so that nerds potential 5 mil millivolts x -3 so that equilibrium potential is about -75 in 10 ok so let's now look at a different iron sodium so sodium has a very low inside a cell compared to outside that ratio is about a factor of 10 but not father of 10 is about to log units right so what's the equilibrium potential for sodium yep + 4 - so it's it's about to login it's x 25 North Ryde so it's plus plus 50 years so how about chloride so this is chloride is a negative ion it has a high concentration outside the cell and a low concentration inside the cell so when when we open up a chloride Chan what happens to the chloride ions which way do they go into the cellar out of the song are there negative so what is that going to do to the voltage inside the cell or negative good turn the ratio of concentrations here is about 10 so like of 10 it's 2ish so what's that about -50 exactly if you plug in the actual numbers it's -60 great here's an interesting one calcium-calcium is a captain in extremely low concentration inside of cells because it's use signalling molecule when calcium comes into a cell it actually does things important so the so the cell buffers calcium it it's a quest calcium into the endoplasmic reticulum and keeps the concentration in the cytoplasm very low the concentration outside the cell is about to the ratio is a pretty big number so if you are ok why is why is the coffee machine hair Katie over Q why is that 12 mm bolts here instead of 25 excellent so it's Katie over 2 times the electron charge pay so that's $12 very good and so the equilibrium potential for calcium is very positive great any questions about that so these are most important ions that we have to think about in terms of ionic conductances across across the Membrane question ok so let's go back to our Lauren in the dish and we're going to consider on that has a a potassium conductance and a high potassium concentration inside the cell remember we can write down that the magnitude of that conductances ji-sub Kay and now we're going to do an experiment or going to measure the voltage in our sell the Steady State as a function of the amount of current that is either being injected or passing through the Membrane ok it's steady-state those two things are the same sorry going to plot the potassium current through the Membrane as a function of the voltage of the South so let's say that we inject 0 current what's the Steady State voltage in the cell going to be just went through the I have to call ok I have a volunteer about you are white white 25 ml bolts and with will assume the channels open so what is the answer is that if you inject 0 current the the voltage is going to be the north potential ask him and dad is correct but what is the actual number it's going to be around -75 Sophie inject 0 current voltage of an Iran is going to be around UK or -75 novels let's start injecting current into the cell until the voltage gets to 0 K now going to be injecting positive current into the shopping - what do we have to do injector positive or negative current to make the voltage get up to 0 positive right because the voltage inside is negative so we need to inject positive charges and how much current do we need to inject the conductance SG how much current to interact v v is the voltage inside of a cell so you're getting there you're really close what's the answer hey x g ok so we're going to end the current into herself until the voltage gets to 0 and if we inject different amounts of current into the cell and measure what the voltage is we get kind of a straight line for potassium if you hold the voltage positive above the equilibrium potential potassium ions are going to flow out through the member is that clear let's hold the let's hold the voltage at 0 which way are ions flowing so the ions are going to be out hold the voltage at EK what happens to the potassium current because you're now it's enormous potential and if you hold the voltage below that the inside of the is now a negative relative to the nearest potential and currents gonna flow in the notice that the current actually were vs sign around EK ok and so sometimes this voltage is called the reversal potential ok so you're here me sometimes referred to the reversal potential and that what's the same as the Norris potential or the equilibrium potential ok so the equation for something like this a straight line That's offset from zero is Justice so this expression right here is going to be our basic model for Howie the current through an iron as a function of the voltage of the Membrane so current the potassium current is just the potassium conductance * the difference of the Membrane potential from the river so potential ok so i k it was GK x minor CK we also have a circuit a little simple equivalent Circuit that describes this relation and this it looks like we have a what we're going to do to discussed include the effects of this iron this iron specific conductance in the presence of a concentration gradient is to take our conductor this to hear a conductance and put it in series with a battery so that's the basic Circuit element that describes this kind of ivy why is that ok so let's break this down a little bit basically what we're going to do is we're going to equate this membrane potential difference clean the inside in the outside of the cell is potential difference to the sum of the voltage drops across these two elements is it 1 bolts the same as the battery in here what is it exactly so the voltage drop across this battery is EK what's the voltage drop across this resistor this potassium conductance what is it depend on what is the current is 0 what's the voltage drop across a resistor whose current is 0 Onslow rate what is it at arbitrary current what's the voltage drop across resistor as a good can somebody tell me what it is in terms of the quantities that we have looking for a severe crosshair ok so VM the Membrane potential has two just equal the sum of those two voltage severe me cos EK plus IKEA Ridge EK and now it's just saw this for ok this little Circuit element describes our the conductance that's the equation that goes with it question alright what's push on this quantity right here by the way V - EK is called the driving FV is equal to EK than the driving potential is 0 and there's no cracked the current through the channel is proportional to the driving potential alright let's let's just so there is our new circuit diagram for our cell that's a capacitor who's rain has little leaks in it where there is a ion-specific permeability of the poor and iron fresh ingredients to produce a battery Circuit you can see that we're getting off Lee close now to the hole equivalent Circuit model that hodgkin-huxley wrote down ok so let's let's just flat out this equation here what is Isa k k is just hopefully my CK very good that the resistance RK is just one over GK and towel again is RK x c so let's massage that's a little bit more we're going to write this down as v + DVD t = EK + what is that that is very good who won CY that's the infinity because if you set divinity equal to 0 virsa call to ik arcade Eyecare Plus rkip if you inject a constant current at Steady State DVD take 40 you can see that the injected current is just equal to the potassium current leaking out through the that all makes great sense so that's the infinity the voltage is just the difference equation is v Plus the infinity exactly the same equation we had before so you know that every moment v is going to be doing what everybody together relaxing toward the infinity right ok where that's our Infinity the we're going to play the Rihanna do the same experiment again here's our pulse of injected Kurt v Infinity is now starting at jumps up to EK plus rki not and it goes back down and voltage of the cell is relaxing toward the in adding that just shifted this voltage Trace down from 0 number this before this was sitting at 0 and now it's sitting at -75 ml bolts any questions alright so we're going to come back in a minute finished washing out this model where are we make those conductances depend on time as a way of describing the spikes that in Iran produces but before we do that we're going to talk about it a much simpler model of how how was spiking around behave basically what word still as we're going to instead of write down a biophysical model of action potentials which is where we're heading we're just going to ask some simple questions about our spiking around behaves notice that action a really important right that there are the way Normans communicate with other Norris they send a signal down your axon to listen or transmitter another na runs but what's the time in Iran is not spiking what is it doing well could be another thoughts certainly sometimes it could be great it's well and and how did you do that it's part of it but yes integrating is inputs and it integrates is important and eventually it's bikes ok so so we're going to develop a model or look at a model now cob not surprisingly integrate-and-fire ok that captures exactly that idea that are more on spends most of I'm integrating it's input making a decision about when the Spike and then spiking over again other a crucial piece of this is that for most types of Nerang the spikes are really all the same the spike waveform don't carry extra information Beyond the fact that there's a spike we're going to treat our spikes as Delta functions just disco events at single time and the spikes are going to occur when the voltage in the Run which is a particular membrane potential called this bike threshold no that's a reasonable approximation for many Lawrence it's not absolute Facebook Medina on spike when the Northern reaches of particular voltage threshold and that's captured in this model called Dr integrate-and-fire know what we're going to do if we're going to take our hodgkin-huxley model and we're going to replace this sodium and potassium conductance is that actually generate the spike work in a replace that with a very simplified model of a spike generator look like basically the idea is that the south gets input from either an electrode or from a chicken pot and it integrates that import until it reaches a voltage called the threshold and once it reaches baffled we simply reset the voltage back down to so about you called the reset ok and then we just do you want to we can test draw a line at a time and that's the spike what really happens to the voltage set once the voltage hits be threshold begets reset back down to any questions that kind of behaviour is not it's fairly common or on so there's example of does the voltage in a cell in motor cortex of the Songbird in this is from a paper from Rich movies lab back in the back in 9 2 and you can see that if you inject current the voltage in the cell ramps up until it hits a threshold voltage it makes a spike which is very narrow in time but then multifaceted down to a lower voltage just repeats over and over again what we're going to do is work going to calculate the rate at which another on fires as a function of how much gets injected into the see how much import a cell cats start by considering the case where the I has no leaks and it's Moreno conductances alright so let's plot voltage as a function of time so this is voltage as a function of time when we act a step of current into the song so what's going to happen and the current turns on some fresh excellent bike that then what's going to happen excellent like that and then what's going to happen current into our cell in our cell is going to generate bikes action potentials at regular intervals and the interval between those spikes is going to be controlled by how long it takes that passador to charge up from the reset to the threshold so we can actually just very simply calculate the firing rate of this Laurent as a function of how much current we injector so the firing rate is just one over that interval between the spikes so now what do we do gas what the next step is how do we figure out how long it takes we know this distance some third grade word problem here come on somebody help me out across the river your paddling you know one that can the river is 10 metres across how about Racer wait shirt what do you think it's not worth trying to calculate time it takes for the voltage to go from here to here what would it depend on what what are you doing but what are you cut your calculating white and you're using what about this line welp exactly great so if we knew the slope of this line we can calculate how long it takes to go from here to here great let's do that so we have this equation CD DVD was Isa me what's the slope of this line it's just DVD tea good so Stevie t that's Delta v over delta t delta v is just this voltage difference right and delta T is what we're trying to calculate are we just solved which is plug this into here and we just saw for one over delta T and that's just seed out times the injected current that's probably what you were saying write any questions about that ok so let's look at what that looks like the firing rate is proportional to the Detectives because 2080 injected current the voltage is constant and the Nerang never fire but if we inject a tiny bit of current the vault slowly ramp up and it will eventually hit the threshold and then reset the vault the fire rate is proportional to the injected current Club one over Delta v if the capacitor is much bigger what happens to the foreign rate close down because as you were current the voltage increases more slowly because the capacitance is bigger right now let's add our our a leak conductance back in Stockton we're going to think of it as a potassium conductance ok so I'm gonna call Angelique because I'm going to use something at leader in the hodgkin-huxley model but you should think about it just as a potassium conduct alright so what let's go to work at a voltage as a function of time during our injected current let's say that we start at the reset our our voltage of the reset so let's start it now what happened yes the voltage starts here cos there's 0 injected current as soon as you inject current the infinity it's up to hear would say the voltage relaxes exponentially toward the infinity until it hits the threshold very good then what happened somebody else but you in the grey shirt Sophie know the answer raise your hand will go much faster ok so at this point it will jump back down great and then why else if you know the answer is your hand just ok let's just do an exercise raise your hand everybody who knows your hand up high ok now one of you say it everybody sad music to my ears ok it relaxes exponentially back to the in ok and tell it's threshold and it comes back ok keeps no what happens here the car turns off what happens that question it out back to why is it VE reset snow cone injected battery Infinity so that's why it relaxes back to to Ely any question it's pretty simple right ok so it's pretty simple and we can derive the expression now for this delta-t and therefore we can drive the equation for the firing rate as a function of injected it's a little more complicated turn the other one I'm going to go through it in a little bit less detailed ok because the answer turns out to actually be pretty simple so we're going to calculate the phone rate which is just one over this delta-t here before we actually get into the math what happens if the infinity is die I know the answer to that question is your hands I want spike right good ok so the infinity actually has to be above the threshold in order for that spike that make sense ok so something is different already because because before we found it currently in Jack the soul would eventually spike but now what we see as when we have A-League the v-infinity actually has to be above the threshold and so that means there is going to be so shuffle current below which the Nerang wants bike that's pretty cool we can see that right away so I just I just define one decode the rear base ok and that is that current at which the Nerang begins to spike so if we start our soul at the reset because I said just spiked it relaxes exponentially toward me infinity but let's say that the infinity is right at 3 you can see that the time to reach the threshold is actually very long it if the infinity is equal to the threshold it will never actually reach it even Infinity is equal to view threshold the phone Raiders zero because if you inject just a tiny bit more current now it'll be in the spike right we can calculate the injector current required to reach threshold that's called the real base we just set v-infinity equal to the threshold right and we use our equation for that's the infinity and we just said it equal the threshold now we just drive the injected can't we just saw I see that's the injected current required to make the infinity reach the threshold and you can see that it's just Julie time to be threshold - all that I threshold what's the firing rate of this Lauren is 04 low current as you inject more current the infinity increases but I still can't reach the threshold until you inject an amount of current such that the infinity reaches be threshold and then it begins to and the phone rate increases rapidly have that I've having a threshold current above which you have to below which the someone's bike so now that's actually derive this equation for this as a function of injected current going to do that and we're going to calculate the amount of time before the cell spikes so we're gonna start the voltage at be reset we know that at some injected current above threshold the cell relaxes exponentially to the infinity and can you calculate how long it takes equal to threshold so you know that that's an exponential right in fact we wrote down the solution to that exponential a bunch of times the difference from v to be Infinity decreases exponentially but we know a bunch of these values right we know where we know that we're calculating these wentao = sorry 20 = delta T at we know the initial voltage that's be reset we know the voltage at time delta T and has just equal to the threshold so we can just substitute those quantities into this equation now we have the pub minus the infinity equals we reset - be infinity x eater the - delta T over town that make sense I just did you just calculating this time that it takes the Nerang to relax exponentially from the reset to be threshold we know all these quantities so we just stick them into this equation and what are we sell for so we take the natural log of while we divide through by the the reset - the infinity take the natural log Alpha delta T so delta T = minor style natural log the infinity minus threshold over the infinity minus be reset it's kind of messy I don't know the shape of that doesn't really lip to my mind ok so we're going to is actually just simplify this expression in a limit in the limit that the in is lard what what happens here when the injected Crown is large what what gets big me in get back when you inject a lot of current the infinity is very high and went the infinity is really big this is action approach is white and what is the log of 1 expression this expression approaches one and this expression the log of that approach is 0 ok so we can do is do a linear summation of this work in the limited the infinity is much bigger than be reset R&B we're going to use the approximation that log of 1 + Alpha is just Alpha approaches one you can write it is 1 + Alpha call thing there are approximately 2 Alpha ok and when you do that and you solve for the phone what you find is that the firing rate is just one over see Delta v times the injected current minus the threshold Perth show current is just the rear base that we calculated before what does that look like but what is the first of all this is I can't simplified this abet what is the fire rate when the current is below a threshold and then if it's a bar hi thresholds for this expression that I wrote right here is true only injected current greater than a threshold 0 below that so now what is this look like pirate is 0 until you hit threshold and then what this equation is linearly in the injected current are at the slope is actually exactly the same as it was for the case where there was no Mick ok so the phone rate is 0 once you hit the threshold the the final rate of increases approximately linearly ok for large currents and if you look down here what you see is that the current actually the actual solution is that the phone Ray jumps up at threshold and then tracks along the linear approximation that the dash line there is the actual solution that the solid line is that the new approximate ok and that right there it is really a very good model for a lot of Nora sort of saturated a little bit though define that kind of flattens out a little bit as you go to very high farm rates but that's a pretty good approximation yes heavy is the is the difference from v reset to v threshold the model was another question here anything else that's the integrated that's probably the most commonly used model of Lawrence in neuroscience simple I should say that's the most commonly used model of spiking mirror actually taken around that behave like this assemble them into complex networks and study how network interactions occur with a spiking model and this this model captures most of the interesting important behaviour of of spiking neurones Russian Daniel Miller questions ok alright let's come back to our Huxley model equivalent Circuit so we just described was a model Nerang in which will replace these potassium conductance is that actually produced his action potentials with a very simple spike generator but now we're going to do is we're going to come to our model and we're going to flush out the biophysical details that allow these to conductances her to producer potential fact most most of the time when we model network simplify the spike generator to something like a integrate-and-fire spike generator Park than hodgkin-huxley develop describing time-dependent and voltage-dependent conductance is so powerful and commonly used describe conductance is that it's really worth understanding that that mathematical description that physical description of ionic conductance is in highly dependent voltage and type sing we do if we noticed that in the hodgkin-huxley model we have three conductances we have conductance which is very much like the leak conductance that we just used in the integrated fire model ok it has a reversal potential of around minor 50 mil bolts and it's just always on it's just a constant conductance we have this to other conductances are sodium candle potassium conductance that are both time-dependent and voltage-dependent each one of those conductances has a current affair the weather currents flowing through ion channel the total membrane is just the sum of all of those currents that's just ionic membrane current it's just the sum of contributions from sodium channels potassium channels and equation for a hodgkin-huxley model using kirkus current like the sum of all the into these no testicles zero so the Membrane ionic current plus the capacitive current equals the injected electric car each one of these conductances each one of these currents can be written down in the same form that we developed for potassium conductance ok it's just a sorry for the potassium current so the sodium current is just a c skin conductance x what what is that driving potential the driving potential for sodium but the saw doctors now is voltage and time-dependent and it's that voltage and time-dependent that gives sodium can soda channel properties that they need to generate action potential it's just an Alex to what we already did before super casting conductor ok and potassium current it's just GK times to driving potential for potassium and the potassium Arkansas voltage and time-dependent 75 DNA is plus 55 conductance delete current rather is just the leak conductance time's the driving potential for the leak current the difference is that in this model now the Lee conductances just constant is no time to Pennant it's always there and it's voltage are any questions but the name of the game here in understanding how this thing works is to figure out where this time dependence and voltage-dependent comes from you're very close equilibrium potential is always very close to -75 in Sumner aren't it might be as low as -95 but it in that range the sodium reversal potential is so with you know + 58 well it's highly consistent across mammal and the numbers for squid are pretty close to the I think these are the numbers for squid came from that come from how to get huxleys ok now how do these things generate action potential just in principle how do you think about conductances like this generator action potential here 020 mean like variable or adjustable so we can imagine that we have a knob a hand on the knob and let's just turn off both down to 0 so what the voltage in the sound going to be what is the sound just not saying it so roughly the it's it's closer it's - OK good so if these conductances are 0 then the cell is going to be sitting at the of this battery 0.30 state 0 current the voltage drop across here is 0 cos there's 0 current and saw the inside of the cell at better be sitting at voltage of flat battery which is -50 what happens if we suddenly turn on a conductance turn by turn on a conductance we make the resistance really small or we make the conductance really big right so what are we doing let's turn that conductor as much as possible which means resetting that resistor 20 if this resistance is 0 then the voltage drop across that the voltage inside has to just be it has to be set to that the voltage of that battery that makes it if we have no conductance here then the inside the cell wall relaxed toward but if we now turn on this conductance we set that resistor 20 voltage jump up Baltic that resistor back up to some big value what's the voltage gonna do arcs back to us about this nice simulation of what happened so here is what is going to happen these conductances are going to 0 we're going to awake these conductances are going to start at zero and then we're going to make this small 0 but small or big and we're going to make that resistor small so the conductances are going to be parted along the bottom and the voltage of the cell is going to be parted as a function of time add the green and red show the reversal potentials for the sodium and potassium where are the sodium conductance just got turned on in what happened the voltage of the South turn on the potassium conductance and we turn off the sodium conductance and the voltage gets dragged down and when we turn off the potassium conductance the voltage relaxes back up to are just knobs that allow the cell to control is vaulted weight of planet you can control the voltage of the Sower just by setting those our use of those resistors if you make this resistor really small and that resistor big the voltage jumps up toward DNA why is that because you're connecting the inside of the cell to that battery turn that off and then turn on this setting that Mr to be very small now you're connecting the inside yourself to this battery which is negative don't here you can just control of the Sower up and just by twiddling these knobs ok to think about it is this if this resistor is big Dan if you set that resistor to be really small than this the voltage here dominus over the time scale of any process that were considering hear the ionic concentration inside the sign outside of the salt don't change that make sense so you said both of these 20 the conductance is really high that means setting the resistor is really small that that's a great question what happens that's exactly right if you said both of these if you turn on both of these conductances then the voltage goes somewhere in the middle and the voltage that it what's 2 is actually you have to potential that we calculated is is calculated only for the case where you have one iron if you want to calculate the equilibrium potential when you have multiple pores open then you have to use you have to use a different method of calculating actually calculate the currents flowing and it's one of those channels and based on the permeabilities of the channels and you get a different expression are called the Goldman Hodgkin equation ok but the bottom line is if you open up both of those princess it's somewhere in the middle and if you want to get the exact right answers is the jet courier quote almost we're not quite there yet we're going to get there but you can see what happens here is that these conductances are actually voltage-dependent so for example the sodium conductance turns on at higher voltages when this Stockton starts getting bigger what happens to the voltage in the cell it's going up right but if this is voltage-dependent and it turns on at higher voltage what happens to the conductance when the voltage gets a little bit bigger what happens to the conductive to the voltage makes it go up faster this runaway process where where the boat were the disc inductance turns on very quickly in the voltage jump start ok that's the essence of the action potential ok but the essential picture that I wanted you to get from this from this slide these are just knobs and when you turn the knobs you can change the vote that controls the voltage in the cell which one of these is causing the cell to be dragged toward it's reversal potential inductance is big this conductances big that voltage in the south-west drag tour DNA voltage in the cell gets dragged 40K next time we're going to go through the are the process for a describe the process to drive the voltage dependence of I am check the sodium and potassium ion channels to derive the voltage dependent and the time dependence that explains how you get this action potential so that's next Tuesday
