Where do the ‘batteries’ of a
neuron come from?

1) lon concentration gradients

2) lon-selective pores (channels)

How big is the battery (how
many volts?)

 

This is determined by a balance
between diffusion down a concentration
gradient balanced by ‘drift’ in the
opposing electric field.

ENDELEMENTHow to implement an ion specific conductance
as a battery in our model neuron

 
ENDELEMENTPotassium I-V relation

One of the best ways to study the function of an ion channel is
to plot the current-voltage relation (I-V curve). This can be

measured as the current required to hold the neuron at a given
voltage. he

 

For a potassium conductance

* If you hold the voltage above the
equilibrium potential, K current will flow out I
through the membrane (positive current) K

* If you hold the cell below E,, then the
current will flow into the cell.

     

Ex

Note that the current reverses at the equilibrium potential, so this

is often referred to as the ‘reversal potential’ 24
ENDELEMENTI-V relation

This relation turns out to be monotonic and Tx
roughly linear for ion channels in the open
state. So we can write:

spikes as 6 — functions

* While APs (spikes) are important, they are not what neurons spend most of
their time doing. Spikes are very fast (~1ms in duration).

* This is much shorter than the typical interval between spikes (~100ms). Most
of the time, a neuron is ‘integrating’ its inputs. (Separation of timescales)

* All spikes are the same. (No information carried in the details of action
potential waveforms.)

* Spikes tend to occur when the voltage in a neuron reaches a particular

membrane potential, called the spike threshold. 36

simple. When the voltage
reaches the threshold V,,, it generator
resets the neuron to a hyper-
