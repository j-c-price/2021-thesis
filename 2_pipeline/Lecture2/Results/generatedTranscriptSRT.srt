3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:30,000
so we have a organise three lectures and the basic idea of the lectures

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
to cover some of the major current issues in nuclear arms control and non-proliferation ok

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:50,000
we have a the first lecture today on India and Pakistan which is one of the world's apart

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:00,000
flashpoints meaning that this desert there's a a path to a possible nuclear war

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:10,000
which I won't go into the bin Nerang will certainly spell out the case but in my view intro

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I said want to talk about this was a golden opportunity because phippen is here and he's an expert on these issues

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:30,000
send a I consider this as I say one of the possible flashpoints in the world one of the possible conceivable pets

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,000
path is super likely if you want to put it that way but the effects of a nuclear exchange a catastrophic both

11
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:50,000
the people who get hit obviously because a nuclear weapon I don't have to tell you is incredibly destructive in Hiroshima

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:00,000
something like 40% of the population was killed more or less instantly Burns or blas and probably another 20

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:10,000
percent died within a year of radiation so in addition people have realised that there are severe climate

14
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:20,000
effects of a nuclear exchange one of things that happens with all the burning that goes on is that suit is

15
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:30,000
medi into the atmosphere this is the opposite of global warming this is global cooling this is like a volcanic

16
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:40,000
explosion and in about 18 15th 1816 it was a volcanic explosion in Asia

17
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:50,000
there was a winter without there was a summer excuse me there was a summer without crops in Europe ok

18
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:00,000
actually starvation in Europe due to this explosion was a one-time thing or the climate models

19
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:10,000
even a limited nuclear war in Southeast Asia are showed that this effect would probably last 5 to 10 years

20
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Global ok from roughly 100 nuclear weapon so there are papers I can give people references if they want

21
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:30,000
there's a paper in physics today A few years ago about this but there are many papers on the subject so one of the things

22
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:40,000
they say so the second lecture will be on on the proliferation and and uranium enrichment

23
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:50,000
the implication so these lectures will combine both technology and policy and finally the last lecture I will give an

24
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:00,000
sign of an overview of where we stand on nuclear arms control and proliferation I'll try to fill in some of the gaps I'll talk about the non-proliferation

25
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:10,000
you that's coming up at the UN next spring I've talked about the outlook for arms control as I see it ok

26
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I want to talk a few minutes to the students because one of the things that's happened over the last few

27
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:30,000
since the collapse of the Soviet Union in about 1990 people stop worrying about the bond so

28
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:40,000
speak before that there was a lot of concern still the for ask the duck under their desks and things like that

29
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:50,000
back themselves which class was totally ridiculous wooden desk would enjoy him but she could and that nuclear war

30
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:00,000
you can well in that picture

31
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:10,000
but are the issue was kind of fallen off the table and the thing that concerns p

32
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:20,000
war on campus when if they think about Global issues is climate change and global warming ok but this is an issue with

33
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:30,000
has not gone away if anything the probability of of a nuclear exchange is higher now than a decade ago

34
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:40,000
watching it Wayne and we have not solve these problems and there are political and economic problems

35
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I want to see a few words about some of the intellectual problems that need to be sold for example on a technical base

36
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:00,000
where there are inspection issues ok for example how do you inspect whether and

37
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:10,000
country is cheating on its 94 liberation obligations you look for weapons production or in Richmond

38
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:20,000
this is a very difficult issues OK and they're very difficult technical issues so and then there are issues in which

39
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:30,000
you have to combined technical issues with policy for example if we're going to go down to a very small number of weapons as you want to do

40
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:40,000
nuclear arms control then are cheating with a small number particularly if you're gonna go to 0

41
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:50,000
what's a small number becomes a bigger issue so verification issues a very important reinventing the bomb you know if you really want

42
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:00,000
so they're all kinds of intellectual issues that need to be worked out ok both historical Technic

43
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:10,000
and political and there are many opportunities for research in these areas ok your ups and faeces so I just

44
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:20,000
point that out and they're also positions in in government and ngo's in the last semester we had several major on

45
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:30,000
trough negotiators from the US government including Rose got me all the who was the chief Negotiator on the US side

46
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:40,000
for the new start reading said she was particularly excited to give a talk and mit because we really needed a journal

47
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:50,000
technically train people to go into nuclear arms control and she made a special plea so I want to pay us that along

48
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:00,000
so I'm going to get to today's lecture VIP in Nerang is a

49
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:10,000
in the MIT political science department and and the security studies program he's got a BS and Ms

50
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:20,000
chemical engineering he's got a degree from Bali or College where I spent it very happy semester and ask her

51
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:30,000
and he's written extensively on non-proliferation and an issues of

52
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Iams control the tolerance in particularly with respect the Southeast Asia and he's got a a book recently pub

53
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:50,000
regional powers and international conflict so vipin great thanks thanks for the kind introduction and organise

54
00:08:50,000 --> 00:09:00,000
so Sarah said I'm a person the political science department and it was primarily a nuclear Strata simple operation and so

55
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:10,000
what I thought I do today was talk about giving an overview of nuclear proliferation and the consequences of proliferation

56
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:20,000
South Asia between India and Pakistan which is Aaron mentioned an active an ongoing conflict with a thread of conventional war is persistent

57
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:30,000
are there periodic military crazies between India and Pakistan that put both countries of the risk of commercial conflict

58
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:40,000
every now and then and now they're both sides both States have nuclear weapons the question is what the likelihood of escalation the nuclear level is

59
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:50,000
just as a preview of my own thinking I'm in writing on the subject I think India and Pakistan have so far been lucky Inn

60
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:00,000
can a commercial conflict is not yet escalated to the nuclear level but that's not a foregone conclusion going for a little bit about that and it's one of the reasons where the still act

61
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:10,000
arms racing between India and Pakistan and so we'll talk a little bit about that and what the dynamics have been with the nucleus strategies and with the effects on

62
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:20,000
distance between India and Pakistan are there any questions that all electric don't hesitate to start me another diverse backgrounds 0 people from different departments undergraduate graduate

63
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:30,000
old go through some basic theoretical material first if that's if everybody is no

64
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:40,000
with that we can move that pretty quickly and talk about India and Pakistan in the process of building up their delivery systems

65
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:50,000
the nuclear arsenal this is a picture of a shaggy missile which is the Pakistani long it's a medium range ballistic missile in the Pakistani inventory and it's based off of 8

66
00:10:50,000 --> 00:11:00,000
export missile the M class exports and both are actively testing short and long-range cruise and

67
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:10,000
metals as their inventories are growing and that is one of the concerns I think as we are talking about the basic puzzle though is

68
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:20,000
does anyone know what these pictures are from so in November and November 26th 2008 two weeks before my wife and I got married and tell you actually

69
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:30,000
a group nominally sponsored and based in Pakistan the luxury Tiber orchestrated and a pretty

70
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:40,000
c-based see launch attack against Bombay were about 12 it doesn't militants lead by the one survivor from the militant group

71
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:50,000
America's kasab pictured here siege the Taj hotel hotel

72
00:11:50,000 --> 00:12:00,000
chabad house in Bombay and killed over 170 Indians and westerners and the Indian government was faced with the

73
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:10,000
in about how to respond to this is the third private patient that the Indian government believe was sponsored by Pakistan in the since 1988 the year in with a test nuclear weapons

74
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:20,000
and the the question facing Union leaders how do we respond to a state that sponsors militant attacks against The Metropole or metre

75
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:30,000
targets are hotels in a financial centre when they have nuclear weapons and so the warrior then it was a new weapons had in bold and

76
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:40,000
find a sponsor these groups for a perpetrating more daring and ID say tax against India and because Pakistan have nuclear weapons India didn't have a

77
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Skeletor reaction Pakistan for these attacks and still didn't government for a deck it has been trying to deal with what they believe is a policy paralysis

78
00:12:50,000 --> 00:13:00,000
about dealing with the Pakistan that is more willing to support militant organisations to attack India now that has nuclear weapons

79
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:10,000
brief outline of the basic deterrence there and political science and economics the core of nuclear strategy both in the Cold War and

80
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:20,000
is deterrence Theory so hopefully it's not too basic I don't need to talk about the basic physics ideas will go through a really briefly some of the choices States have

81
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:30,000
in had the operation eyes are so it's really important india-pakistan context of the causes of and the process of nucleation South Asia how and why in Deer Park

82
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:40,000
why nuclear weapons and then I close all the consequences and where we are today focusing mostly on the period since 99 May 9th

83
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:50,000
yeah it is the breakpoint in India Pakistan nuclear equation that's when India led by the den BJP government testing nuclear weapons Fallout 3

84
00:13:50,000 --> 00:14:00,000
the Pakistani government the definition of definition

85
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:10,000
inspired by Gaslight I'm selling Herman Miller with stretchy this will be familiar to rates to basic 2

86
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:20,000
any context is trying to preserve the status quo by threatening unacceptable cost to an opponent an adversary if they do x write some specified action

87
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:30,000
you do x I will do y and the ideas we preserve the status quo in the idea is that why the punishment that you impose on your avatar opponent

88
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:40,000
should I be greater than the benefits of them achieving whatever their objectives is x such that they order

89
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:50,000
reminder taking the action examples with children so I haven't eaten much also myself and his staff

90
00:14:50,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Stan things and you know one as children get all the rated turns into turns by punishment example that I'm telling you

91
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:10,000
if you if your child does in a something something bad you punish them by saying the room deny them dinner time out right so the

92
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:20,000
punishment after the fact if they do eggs in another example is if you if you hit me I will

93
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:30,000
tell your mother there is a there's a putative aspect to the detergent threats such that the punishment

94
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:40,000
the benefit of whatever an average of Jackie would be that it was before we were going

95
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Armin Target thorough nuclear forces to make it impossible for them to carry out their first strike so in a in a case for somebody is attacking me at the turnstile

96
00:15:50,000 --> 00:16:00,000
that would be a set of killing your mother and take your time off so you can attack me and presumably the cost of cutting your arm off so you cannot achieve your objectives in the First

97
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:10,000
is efficient to deter you from undertaking it right so I think about this determined by punishment we will we will punish you with such a vehicle

98
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:20,000
after you undertake the action such that you you have no incentive rash on sent it to do so vs we will ratchet

99
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:30,000
past while you try to achieve the objectives such that you won't be able to in the first place so it's an important Distinction we think in the even in the

100
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:40,000
are there to get from the Cold War the Distinction was counter Forest vs counter value right so for those the mirror Cold War nuclear strategy when we surrender Target Silvia

101
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:50,000
other economic or industrial capacity that was largely determined by punishment strategy so in the event that they launched a conventional or a first nuclear

102
00:16:50,000 --> 00:17:00,000
we would retaliate against our cities the alternative wasn't it was a big role in The Cold War in a case of a commercial complex we would

103
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:10,000
nuclear weapons are there nuclear weapons such that they were not have the ability to launch those weapons at the United States or it's allies so the deterrence Theory

104
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:20,000
several basic requirements call them the three c's right so you need to have the capability to impose the threat the your prime

105
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:30,000
read so if you if you're threatening to destroy an adversary cities and even the do something you need to have the cave

106
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:40,000
we need some explosive capability because it most important in the nucleus and need a delivery capability nibabel hit their cities write an essay

107
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:50,000
to the to the average Siri I need to be credible right and this term credibility in the concept of credibility as

108
00:17:50,000 --> 00:18:00,000
mod cold war strategy and still dogs new strategy today right credibility is the hardest part of this how could you threaten what was

109
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:10,000
catamount mutual suicide and have incredible by every right so in the event of you know so in the

110
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Cold War Began example is if the Soviet Union took West Berlin was it really credible did you know

111
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:30,000
threaten lunch hundreds of nuclear weapons at the Soviet Soviet cities the Soviet Union probably didn't think so right and so undeterred by

112
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:40,000
deterrence by denial trade-off which one do you think is more credible in the case where an attack is coming out as more credible threat to kill their mother and response

113
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Watercraft alarm what is an attacker more likely to believe it is it is disproportionate to threaten certain pewter

114
00:18:50,000 --> 00:19:00,000
and so it is often more credible in this is where the trade-off between the debate early in the Cold War about two turns determined by punishment

115
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:10,000
on the credibility differences between the two that determines Biden I seem to be more credible the Avatar is more likely to believe that you would try to stop them from achieving their objectives

116
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:20,000
millions of an innocent civilian as I had nothing to do with the fight in the first place after something

117
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:30,000
so the important it was the that the size of the US Arsenal made it possible threat in both

118
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:40,000
but they were I think there are many strategies to believe that the two turns by tonight on Nations were still more credible to the adversary but at the heart of deterrence is a social credibility

119
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:50,000
and authority is communication the adversary needs to know that you have the capability and credibility to threaten the punishment or deter

120
00:19:50,000 --> 00:20:00,000
nail threat that you that then you may have to make a threat it has to be published the average he has to know what the threat is the average I need to know what

121
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:10,000
objective your lightly rolling a red line down for and that you have the capability to inflict the punishment that you threaten so there's a huge

122
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Bering Sea that is required for a deterrent to operate Dr Strangelove the movie what's the problem with the doomsday machine in

123
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Strangelove is a great line what's the point of a Doomsday machine if you don't tell anybody about it for everybody that the Aborigines to know that undertake

124
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:40,000
turn actions will result in some punishment for two turns to operate and fit as a concept

125
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:50,000
the cast of the racing at the cost of train to turn an adversary predates nuclear weapons by centuries dawn of Warfare

126
00:20:50,000 --> 00:21:00,000
the nuclear weapons fundamentally altered deterrence equations for several recent right one the explosive you even Hiroshima bomb

127
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:10,000
times 100000 people entire cities with you know a single warhead

128
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:20,000
more than that the missile age really changed how to turn could operate because prior to nuclear weapons what was the most destructive

129
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:30,000
military technology and stayed in state cemeteries and we're now how did how did the allies and

130
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:40,000
how many attack and the problem was to send hundreds of aeroplanes and sort is in enemy Territory

131
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:50,000
complete that kind of damage so your old pilots in airports was a risk that no risk to your pilot than

132
00:21:50,000 --> 00:22:00,000
that you required to destroy entire cities from much smaller to you could wreck it up the costs really quickly without in

133
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:10,000
podcast yourself in the way the strategic bombing of firebombing required of the nuclear age and what's your number

134
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:20,000
psychological impact of an avatar of being able to destroy entire city for the single warhead promo for is very little risk to itself

135
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:30,000
ratchet up the ease of imposing punishment in Waze a dinner to the nuclear explosions

136
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:40,000
is there a family with the basics of uranium plutonium nuclear weapons right so I don't need to go through and reassure him bitoneum from reprocessing there's a basic

137
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Noosa fishing weapon so what is important I think it is most regional Powers are operating so india-pakistan South

138
00:22:50,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I have nuclear weapons South Africa little known facts South Africa nuclear weapons from 1979 about 91 most States start with fish and weapons

139
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:10,000
move to boost efficient weapons defence nuclear power set Fusion weapons most of the United States

140
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Nicola is composed of Thurman thermonuclear weapon think of the a bomb that's fishing in

141
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:30,000
special weapons the age did the H bomb Fusion weapons and extremely

142
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:40,000
roll a thermonuclear weapon read as a primary Knights Fusion secondary the mysteries of Harris operating here right so North

143
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:50,000
India Pakistan is real is assumed to have boost efficient devices but I it's possible their Future Weapons unknown than ever tested

144
00:23:50,000 --> 00:24:00,000
the nuclear forces Britain Britain is basically the United States that leased their weapons from the United States

145
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:10,000
RFA tridents so those her basically us weapons the French a Fusion weapons but india-pakistan are operating in the fishing

146
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:20,000
boost efficient random that's important when you can get to make it on Wheels you're talking about characteristically different weapons the number there be required to destroy the entire City

147
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:30,000
are much lower wants a Fusion weapons but obviously efficient it or a boost efficient device could do a lot of damage as well but that's not

148
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:40,000
you know you're only halfway there in terms of operation is a nucleus and I think this is often forgot we talked about the preparation process deep state need more than just news

149
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:50,000
and Warheads functional and reliable Warheads delivery capabilities rate so the first question you have is ok how many and what type of nuclear weapons

150
00:24:50,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I want to have Indian Pakistani this question is unclear how much is enough for Indian Pakistan is on clear how much is an opera trying to write China as about

151
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:10,000
it's estimated in the 200 400 thermonuclear weapon range size faced with us

152
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:20,000
fences conventional counterforce capabilities is Uncle how much is enough for China to be able big piece of you know this question is

153
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:30,000
a big concept in the in the coral was secure second strike capability so we were worried about dinner so worried about a bolt out of the blue First Strike you lose and number

154
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:40,000
happens when you have enough they'll be able to provide that not only in terms of numbers but in deployment modes right where are they were where there are bass and how they're

155
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Italian back with certain d against the Soviet Union such that into the server uniform trying to undertake what is known as a splendid Forest

156
00:25:50,000 --> 00:26:00,000
places like being the ability to fully wipe out your new chlorosil capability is first dates of when they XIV

157
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:10,000
mobile number is an appointment mode such that an adversary cannot be company that are fully Disarm that states nuclear arsenal

158
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:20,000
are the questions how do you deliver them bread so most States start with aircraft you've got aircraft your ringtone

159
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:30,000
weapons aircraft as a delivery capability

160
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:40,000
UKF to penetrate any defences right you're not going to get there without a fight and so you know it's not it's not the ideal type of delivery keep Billy railway strategic bomber

161
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:50,000
if you've compliments of your escort aircraft there are not survivable if the aircraft as you can recall them they're piloted

162
00:26:50,000 --> 00:27:00,000
bring them back the disadvantages they still have air forces air defence it sorry so then

163
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Powers are attracted to ballistic missiles of various types for a ballistic missile have the advantage that can launch them from a far right there different Ranges

164
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:20,000
put yourself you there it's not risky for the user that can be recalled though

165
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:30,000
land based ballistic missiles we have icbm silos in Wyoming and North Dakota

166
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:40,000
sickness on land we moved United States move quickly to see based ballistic missiles slbm

167
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:50,000
why why do you think sea bass is attractive Alicia United States right so

168
00:27:50,000 --> 00:28:00,000
if your subs are quiet enough there are virtually 100% survival bread because it very difficult the track if you're so

169
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:10,000
quiet enough and this is something in a different assumption and that wants a static why is a sea bass capability it has

170
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Revival second strikeforce probably in the US case but states ssbn the sea bass

171
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:30,000
ballistic missile nuclear submarines as quiet as United States is increasing evidence to show that we are pretty good at tracking Soviet sbends wheels

172
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:40,000
tracking service during the Cold War I don't know how much I mean you have to soon and you know so Soviet sbends as a

173
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:50,000
later generations of quiet and we're still pretty good at track in them you can imagine first-generation Chinese sbends Indian spn4 going to be so loud

174
00:28:50,000 --> 00:29:00,000
nuclear power the diesel power which actually helps with the noisy nature but you know it is it is not necessarily the case that all states that acquire CBS cable

175
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:10,000
don't have survival second rate with the attraction of Seabiscuit AC base force summer a submarine base nuclear force is more

176
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Lamby Lamby sports with all the imminent out there now you can track you know were more sites might be within a flush out lamb base for sister then you can

177
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:30,000
increasingly some States States led by the United States are attracted Cruise missiles as new delivery tomahawks

178
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Tomahawk land and air base nuclear version the French have an air launched cruise missile

179
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:50,000
mainstay of their nuclear pore structure because they can Cruise missiles

180
00:29:50,000 --> 00:30:00,000
what's the warrior now that with ballistic missile with Ballistic missiles racing missile defence is in the oven

181
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:10,000
is drowning threaten to try ballistic missile so one shift is to Cruise missiles which there they

182
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:20,000
altitude control so there's more recallability I think the Cruise missiles in the ballistic missiles but Premier Li

183
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:30,000
missile defence is some States put the nuclear forces on a military control some stays put them

184
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:40,000
sink in a very firm civilian control this is a question that I say to wrestle with during the Cold War additionally the department of atomic energy

185
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:50,000
managed the nuclear pets in the United States is on the very first building control and then as it became clear that the United States will have to Delegate some

186
00:30:50,000 --> 00:31:00,000
nuclear forces to the army in Western Europe for tactical nuclear weapons the US Arsenal

187
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Kmart of military management but still under in a civilian authority it's like Pakistan or completely under military control about that

188
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:20,000
fundamentally the the question that regional powers in particular had to face in Wizard the superpowers didn't as much as what are you trying to deter with nuclear

189
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:30,000
why are you tracking nuclear weapons and what are you using them for in a larger Strategic Policy so some States

190
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:40,000
nuclear weapons just to deter new careers against that stays like China free sample right with huge geographies in 3 million min arms

191
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:50,000
that strategy really facing conventional threats on land the way that the US and Soviet Union were facing off in Western Europe

192
00:31:50,000 --> 00:32:00,000
China and India both have nuclear weapons to deter nuclear use against unless you worry about a nuclear hereditary you don't want your address I don't have nuclear weapons

193
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:10,000
not have the ability retaliate to deter nuclear use against you and you can then rely on what we call an issue of retaliation strategy

194
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:20,000
you just need to be able to survive what might be a first strike against you and tell you when nuclear weapons against your avatar is population centres this is your Classic 2

195
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:30,000
nuclear weapons don't need to be on high alert retaliation doesn't need to be immediate it just needs to be certain and

196
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:40,000
you don't need tactical nuclear weapons because you're not using nuclear weapons on conventional forces that might be attacking you so this allows for much more Central

197
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:50,000
assess management if that's your in if your aim is to deter conventional aggression this was the US and NATO during the Cold War

198
00:32:50,000 --> 00:33:00,000
we're conventional interior already in Europe in order to set the the conventional capability of the Warsaw Pact and the sea

199
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:10,000
we United States need a nuclear weapons the threat of tactical nuclear weapons to offset that differential

200
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:20,000
weapons first if Warsaw Pact commercial forces came crashing in Western Europe explicitly use tactical nuclear weapons

201
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:30,000
dancing what's up at forces weapons unless you use them against me

202
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:40,000
family strategic weapons compared to hear you have a very forward aggressive tactical nuclear weapons capability

203
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:50,000
how to render use nuclear weapons first wreckers you're trying to destroy conventional attacks against you and a kind of looks like a denial and Punishment mission at the same time

204
00:33:50,000 --> 00:34:00,000
an original power is a piece of the same question now can anyone guess where India Falls

205
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I forgot to tell you that I tried period against Pakistan not really what about China and feeding Indian and watching all the way to Delhi the Premier League

206
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:20,000
internal use against against its own cities what is Pakistan for what is Pakistan worried about it's a Pakistan

207
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Milly worry about India international superior already and having been at the receiving end of dismemberment Familia 1971 Mattel talk about Pakistan has operation

208
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:40,000
very aggressive very oriented towards Battlefield nuclear weapons against any conventional forces that might cross the international border

209
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:50,000
a first year psychology symmetric escalation doctor and they threatened escalator commercial complex is a nuclear very quickly because

210
00:34:50,000 --> 00:35:00,000
earlier than you know your India would before any new other nuclear weapons new years because they're worried about Indian commercial superiority

211
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Pakistan actually started it's it's nuclear program before India tested that so-called peony and 1974 because

212
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:20,000
the 90s Celtic about this actually right now so India India security security vitamins took the right so has the 90621 China and which it's

213
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:30,000
it's it's conventional performance shock even the the end of the Indian army in the Indian leadership because the Chinese

214
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:40,000
the Chinese perform so much better than the end is in the 62 war in India decisively last 62 or 2 years later

215
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:50,000
it's nuclear weapons right so the Indian military program gets it's motivation initially

216
00:35:50,000 --> 00:36:00,000
is experiences in 62 and 64 China and to avoid in the future against China

217
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Hedges under the new years in the subsequent leadership on the Ender Gandhi Pakistan

218
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:20,000
superiority and the rules really never any talk about needing nuclear weapons to deter the Pakistanis

219
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:30,000
so India had a civilian nuclear program we're going to Canberra from Canada some of the heavy water was supplied by the nice days and 54 reprocessing facility

220
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:40,000
474 Indira Gandhi authorises was known at the time of the atoms for peace program there is a category

221
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:50,000
peaceful nuclear explosion which was their legitimate legitimate uses it was believe

222
00:36:50,000 --> 00:37:00,000
time for the clear large swathes of land for dams for sample rate in India was had

223
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:10,000
potential uses for this but didn't really full I'm in a peaceful who is closer to nuclear explosion it wasn't however a warhead writer me this thing was a rickety

224
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:20,000
metres in diameter device I mean it with Hawking unstable rickety fish in device that they test

225
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:30,000
suitable for a military program didn't have it wasn't even suitable for delivery by aircraft you have to

226
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:40,000
brought out the back of a cargo plane right I mean it's still give them certainly the the physics of being able to you no

227
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:50,000
efficient efficient and have like you know spiritual compression all that was put on in Dubai so it wasn't

228
00:37:50,000 --> 00:38:00,000
it wasn't trivial but it wasn't a nuclear weapon in the sense of the year that we think of so a lot of work was still at yet to be done Aphrodite same for Ford Everest

229
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I just had the ability to a list in a design rudimentary nuclear weapons weather for white test in 74 as a general security environment October

230
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:20,000
British Pakistani just won the 1970 war with 1971 war with Pakistan which split Pakistan into or talk about that there was a real motivation

231
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Sony program nation is a combination of domestic politics and the power of The Scientist in India so in the Gandhi was facing a

232
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:40,000
series of losses in state government's she wanted a big when the there are several very prom

233
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:50,000
physicist and engineering who promised the the big boost in her electoral fortunes if she tested

234
00:38:50,000 --> 00:39:00,000
happened and they really wanted to test a nuclear weapon because it working on it so I just like to test things that you work on and they have been doing this processing for 7 years and she then

235
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:10,000
opportunity in 1974 when right before serious state elections the authorisation test empirically

236
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:20,000
testing actually help with that much electrically but there is a belief that it might and sort out some of the motivations for the test from 1974 until

237
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:30,000
1080 night for about 15 years India's nuclear program went into effect of dormancy there is no high-level authorisation from Indra Gandhi or her

238
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Asahi Delirium prime minister after assassination 1984 for the militarisation of the program so India scientist worked on

239
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:50,000
some of the theoretical work from miniaturisation getting India in a place where if it had 2 mil is a program it could

240
00:39:50,000 --> 00:40:00,000
there is no actual physical work done that after 1974 Pakistan someone different security environment

241
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:10,000
in your life 262 war and then face China's nuclear test but never really face the threat of a mass of conventional invasion from China really wanting nuclear weapons

242
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:20,000
the Chinese nuclear threat not the Chinese conventional threat Pakistan was really scored by the 1970 one more one more

243
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:30,000
was the war in which East Pakistan was birth in the Bangladesh refugee crisis Westpac

244
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:40,000
is a Pakistan at birth in 1947 was split in 9 contiguous with Indian the middle east and west park west park nearby Punjabi

245
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:50,000
if I can always dominated by bangladeshis Bengali sorry leader bangladeshis Bengali straight so there was ethnic tension between

246
00:40:50,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Punjabi comedy the politics of Pakistan Bengali felt like there a second class citizens and Pakistan that created political tension and there is no prizing in

247
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Tammy wein India intervene on behalf of the bengalis to split East Pakistan v West Pakistan India this is a huge strategic victory right

248
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:20,000
you add two flags of Pakistan in a surrounding you in your able to make them two independent countries

249
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:30,000
that you have birth Bangladesh from Bangladesh from Pakistan so it's not like they would be allies

250
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:40,000
inner conflict strategically this brought up pretty well for India before West Pakistan now present a Pakistan this is a pretty Siri Mum it right your

251
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:50,000
East Wing is amputated and it was at the hands of the Indians right so as early as 1965

252
00:41:50,000 --> 00:42:00,000
if you came through the Indian might look at nuclear weapons because of China zulfikar Ali bhutto who is the prime minister of authorising the program

253
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:10,000
1870s so we will eat grass relieve sorry we got hungry but we will get a bomb about it's one of his famous quotes remember this is this is services 1965 but after the

254
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:20,000
tell me one more in January 1970 right after the 1971 war nuclear weapons program with Express intent of militarised nuclear weapons

255
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:30,000
any international Tower so it wasn't because of the Indian peony right which is 1974 pack

256
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:40,000
nuclear weapons program predates India's 1974 test the real motivation was the 1971 Pakistan cannot suffer the conventional defeat

257
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:50,000
at the hands of the Indians again and so the program was triggered for a state

258
00:42:50,000 --> 00:43:00,000
that was essentially desperate for nuclear weapons Pakistan tried all possible Avenue straight so yeah the Iranian pathway which was led by EQ can't ever

259
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:10,000
you can't yes we can't this horrible horrible joke I apologize but designs European

260
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:20,000
from the Netherlands from the inside he stole the blueprints for what ended up in the P1

261
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:30,000
and that he might have a little bit of Pichu designs right so he stole the arenco centrifuge designs from from your raincoat self or he was an employee

262
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:40,000
back to futon so I can deliver it program and they set up Cascades

263
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:50,000
the P1 at Cohuna with Pakistan wouldn't I for the 1980s was you're a Mauritian facility than president

264
00:43:50,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Zia is a good shed repeatedly interactions with the United States the problem was what happened in 1979

265
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Charlie Wilson's War anyone this true

266
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:20,000
get the heart of Christ in the the revolution around but also have what else December 1979

267
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:30,000
the soviets invade Afghanistan and Pakistan is America's one of the most useful countries in

268
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:40,000
in the world in a stairs because you know stairs decides to supply the Mujahideen and I can't start a fight the soviets how do you get supplied to the motor then you'll have to write them through Pakistan

269
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:50,000
the relationship between Pakistan and the United States florist because we really had no option for a history doesn't repeat itself but it rhymes Road exact Centre

270
00:44:50,000 --> 00:45:00,000
thousands and when we were when we were at war in Afghanistan we needed the ground lines of communication to Pakistan

271
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:10,000
and the relationship between the OSI and the CIA in the 1980s because of the usual not going to stand became

272
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:20,000
what's the right word for in blossomed but it was always there always tension and that relationship but due to us non proliferation lead

273
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:30,000
in Congress the United States would have been obligated to sanction Pakistan and cut off all aid

274
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Pakistan were to assemble a nuclear weapon racks and India never signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty required estate

275
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:50,000
not a member of the non cooperation treaty with nuclear weapons weapons face

276
00:45:50,000 --> 00:46:00,000
sanctions cut off of us a right but that threatened us operations in Afghanistan so that could happen so the there is a lot of tension between the non proliferation haha

277
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:10,000
state department and executive so the Reagan administration went to great lengths to play fast and loose on

278
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Pakistan was with US nuclear program everybody knew the Pakistan had a nuclear weapons program but the wording of the the language of the legislation required

279
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:30,000
let you know invited was not as a solo as I meant that the US president certify the packs and does have nuclear weapons right

280
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:40,000
as long as the exact and the executive to find nuclear weapons as the assembly of a nuclear weapon as long as Pakistan do not cross that

281
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:50,000
executive could certify the Pakistan was a 9 nuclear weapon state and was therefore in the 8th in the relationship between the US and Pakistan

282
00:46:50,000 --> 00:47:00,000
could continue

283
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:10,000
is the Pakistan Pakistan Pakistan and this is the this is the president of the executor bhutto in 1979 I think

284
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:20,000
79 and he's the he's a present pachysandra in the 1980s and we get through the AC

285
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:30,000
to nucleation rates 083 there's some Chinese assistance to the Pakistani nuclear program in fact unprecedented I think in the annals of proliferation China

286
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:40,000
it is now I think you know out in I think the declassified aren't we believe the nicest believes and I think Pakistan is a metre

287
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:50,000
50 kg of each of you from Pakistan right that's effectively to bombs worth of huu

288
00:47:50,000 --> 00:48:00,000
kilograms of a program designed to see you from China plus the design for a uranium

289
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:10,000
uranium core warhead known as a chick Ford as a fourth test in the Chinese test series 19 3 and 86.96

290
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:20,000
do us essential condenser Parkinson nuclear-capable state certified as a non nuclear weapon state right so there are two screwdriver turns away

291
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:30,000
if item is a nuclear weapon stay in the executive continue to do that in March 1987 year complicate all of this when he claims a Pakistan has a cable

292
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:40,000
in Time magazine so all the non-proliferation Hawks goughnuts right here you have the president of Pakistan saying to

293
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:50,000
hi magazine the Pakistan you can write he's a little bit so you can write Pakistan's ok with it and make them on and they did and

294
00:48:50,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Dan that you are kind of Stephen Solaris amendment were in the present had actually so if I park somewhere tonight in the safe for the way would you put in there I made easy

295
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:10,000
the present to to be able to see that and I'll be lying because the language of this clean nuclear device right so the device wasn't assembled executive

296
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:20,000
could legitimately clean the Pakistan did not have a nuclear weapon even though I had around the pit over there the explosive package over here

297
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:30,000
we're here but it will be in three sides of the room but you can you can certify that wasn't a sample so was in a nuclear weapon and so

298
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:40,000
you know by 1988 the non-proliferation Hawks give it up in Solaris you know equipped that had a Saturday night special capability it may not be

299
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:50,000
elegant but ill do the job and one of the advantages to the Pakistani nuclear weapons program was given the fact that they had a test design from the Chinese

300
00:49:50,000 --> 00:50:00,000
they conducted a series of call a test in the 1980s but they don't have to answer looking at a heart test to know that the their weapons are work on like the Indians who were indigenous

301
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:10,000
they're put on in devices

302
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:20,000
1980-present George HW bush and president and as soon as you know the US dollar

303
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:30,000
collapses anymore

304
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:40,000
call Tess is out of this material see you if you so yeah you especially in the in this case it's

305
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:50,000
it's a spherical compression rate they wanted to as they're testing this post of charges actually got a uniform compression with because they weren't using it's raining device but they won't

306
00:50:50,000 --> 00:51:00,000
contact devices it was raining implosion device and so you could do a call to without the fissile material right to make sure the

307
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:10,000
compressions you can do it you can do you can do sufficient number of cancel out the first material and if since the design itself was tested

308
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:20,000
a heart test that wants a had enough fissile material and in the design it work

309
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:30,000
sun inner spirit remember India's going is in dormancy but there is a in response to Z as claim in

310
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Time magazine and several other statements India bring this program out of dormancy in response actually to Pakistan spoken by so there is a

311
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:50,000
the narrative the commercialism is there India India's program nuclear program baguette Pakistan's nuclear program but none of the other way around so

312
00:51:50,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Durham Street about Indian conventional power India has a rudimentary nuclear hedging program in the 1970s it was only when Pakistan

313
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:10,000
clean publicly that I had a nuclear weapons keep building bit India brings program out of Thomas e89

314
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Rajiv Gandhi orders work on weaponization miniaturisation production line all the things you need to have a military program and any only is turning that at

315
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:30,000
resetting to develop delivery capabilities there they have indigenous missile the opening the preview missile and it was playing from

316
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:40,000
and in this period right so it will take another for 5 years before they would have a militarised program that they could test

317
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:50,000
there are several aborted test 1995 prime minister role of the congress party is on the brink of test and us ambassador Frank

318
00:52:50,000 --> 00:53:00,000
goes to ambassador prime minister round as we know you're about to test don't do it you're the weight of American sanctions will kill you and now we're back off

319
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:10,000
couple months later of the BJP which is a Opposition Party the other the main Opposition Party the time when the office for the first time then office for only 13 days

320
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:20,000
pull back from a test they were planning to conduct when they were in 1988 the BJP it is manifest your service is going to test nuclear weapons

321
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:30,000
when does cut off guard when they came back to power after they had to order test 1996 right everyone claims that the CIA was caught off guard by the May 1998 test but the Pita Pit

322
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:40,000
publicly day if they came in officer in a test nuclear weapons again and it did take a step to camouflage the activity in the test sites but as soon as I can

323
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:50,000
office in two months after their win office for in an apartment majority they test nuclear weapons of 5 fishing devices

324
00:53:50,000 --> 00:54:00,000
decided everything on the Samba Premier League China as a reason for testing nuclear weapons and then the question was how does Indian

325
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:10,000
overly test nuclear weapons operation it's nuclear capabilities as mentioned before India has an issue of retaliation passed away so test nuclear weapons 1998 and the questions Halloween

326
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:20,000
who sings India very quickly decided to have a novice youth policy and don't have a very assertive management of the nuclear forces and rely on it

327
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:30,000
retaliation Kimberley say no tactical nuclear weapons just strategic weapons the capable is under 2 billion custody and the aim of the dark

328
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:40,000
to determine clears against Indian population centres by punishment strategy and their long-range ballistic missiles America

329
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:50,000
sorry but the premier live in a missile capability now and they have a very recessed pasture very few weapons on alert most of the Arts is actually

330
00:54:50,000 --> 00:55:00,000
don't piss time some subset is at Harris rating is put is primarily it would take several you know several steps up a little later before it is

331
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:10,000
do not you know on hair trigger alert is as American Soviet weapons for Pakistan

332
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:20,000
surely appa India they have moved away from your inner Richmond to petone Em for the visit here what's your finished Italian

333
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:30,000
put on in weapons so much better if you

334
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Battlefield nuclear weapons weapons and you have payload constraints of your trading off arrange for payload

335
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:50,000
gets you much better you the way she's right it's about 41 advantage and once they had the

336
00:55:50,000 --> 00:56:00,000
devices in a little worried I was always worried that India would attack it's nuclear facilities once it acquired basic nuclear weapons capability through the rain

337
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:10,000
pathway now it doesn't feel that as much and so most of the production is out in the open and with Chinese help so there a series of Chinese reactors reprocessing facilities are coming online

338
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:20,000
and Pakistan is tripping the Petroleum production capabilities

339
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:30,000
and North Korea so there is a missiles for in your room in Richmond capability trade the Pakistan had with China sorry with North Korea so I got the noodle

340
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:40,000
source from North Korea in exchange North Korea got some pieces for it's uranium enrichment capability that it now has and China also salt

341
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:50,000
sign some are the mdmx for missiles which are the shocking and ghaznavi missiles her for Pakistan

342
00:56:50,000 --> 00:57:00,000
what's if you're trying to have in Pakistan nuclear in who's in the middle

343
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:10,000
bacon sandwich India rate so the enemy of my enemy is my friend

344
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:20,000
not I mean

345
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:30,000
questions and I think the reason the Chinese lightweight like that you provided a nuclear capability or system but you don't want to take on the inner responsibility if they're

346
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Pinot a fracture in the state and local weapons fall into extreme it's hands in the Chinese was you got to somebody's tractors & Chainsaws washed

347
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:50,000
but you know you can think from the strategic perspective I make sense remember have India focused on Pakistan and this is one way to do it I think that's a Chinese motivation

348
00:57:50,000 --> 00:58:00,000
so Pakistan because it's trying to to Indian commercial power has an explicit and explicit first use darken right

349
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:10,000
this is a bold in the past 1516 years first world is credible because all of Pakistan's nuclear weapons Runner military cost

350
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:20,000
I'm like India with a civilian custody and control and nuclear weapons Pakistan is a de facto praetorian state the army is a diamond in decision making body and so all the New Groove

351
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:30,000
program for cradle-to-grave is an army management program a shift to Battlefield nuclear weapons there is a

352
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:40,000
what's a missile if anyone has been following this it's a 60 km short-range nuclear weapon system

353
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:50,000
are there we filled it at the edge of Battle that will Target Union forces if ever if they cross international border there is a Cruise missiles Patrol also designed me about

354
00:58:50,000 --> 00:59:00,000
weapon to ride in the Baba and they have a an explicitly determined by the night on Messenger trying to deter Indian conventional ataxic Rossi international border

355
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:10,000
so there's some the many questions about where and where we are in terms of

356
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:20,000
how India and Pakistan think about nuclear weapons in their fourth posterity

357
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:30,000
question why would Pakistan ask for some of this because the crux of the problem now is he doesn't have any territorial this

358
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Pakistan Road why would India want to dismember Pakistan further it prefers a stable Pakistan it has no territorial ambitions and Pakistan Dorset there's a

359
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:50,000
is a disputed in a dispute over kashmira but frankly the liner control on both sides is effectively the de facto water there won't be much turtle revision over

360
00:59:50,000 --> 01:00:00,000
instantly if you're worried about a conventional attack across the international border how do you get there I'll get to that in one second

361
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:10,000
after very quickly talking about in the nucleus sense what the differences between South Asian the Cold War and nuclear weapons

362
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:20,000
the key differences between India Pakistan in the 90s and Soviet Union one rudimentary capabilities still organisational

363
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:30,000
not as mature in Ida country as in the Cold War especially in the later years the colour obvious Lee but there's a big difference

364
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:40,000
rates of the flight times between India and Pakistan on the order of couple minutes us over 30 minutes half hour

365
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:50,000
I was going on if you have any early warning

366
01:00:50,000 --> 01:01:00,000
is launching a potential nuclear Strike 2 minutes before the thing is going to hit so your reaction time have too much quicker

367
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:10,000
skip through this hear the other big difference is as imagine why would India why would India be

368
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:20,000
conventional attacks against Pakistan wouldn't be Avenue she wouldn't be the first one is the Indian problem right now is facing a Pakistan that is more

369
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Liam bold and two large militant attacks in India using organisation or organisation sponsored by the state Believer be sponsored by the state like

370
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Muhammad and the strategy has s*** changed since Pakistan test nuclear weapons pirate and 1888 Pakistan strategy

371
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Queen by Sia and general Aslam bag nose bleeding India by a Thousand Cuts so the strategy of inner cutting into the periphery right in the line of

372
01:01:50,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Cashmere in the mountains we could have a real convention battle but you can have in a terrorist infiltration to be some attacks and just you know small cuts

373
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:10,000
strategy shifted since 1988 it seems the frequency of over infiltration by regular forces in the kargil war in 1999 and then

374
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:20,000
attacks on Indian Metropolitan cities with his pakistan-based militant organization's conditioner India wouldn't be storing bourbon

375
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Rachel India's mainstay threat Prada nucleation was if you if you try to stretch your brilliance by Thousand Cuts who's gonna punish you were hurt

376
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:40,000
army if you're you're an army let state and only control state will cross all international border and we will treat your army right and that will punish Pakistan

377
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:50,000
the determined by punishment scratching in your head at the conventional level Prado nuclearization

378
01:02:50,000 --> 01:03:00,000
fight for a while but in extreme it's threatens tactical nuclear it is an Indian forces if India tries to return it across international border

379
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:10,000
India find now and that's the steering which India think about convertible Comfort Pakistan it's not for Territory ambition or any Territory or before retaliation after a private patient

380
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:20,000
so there a couple examples of the kargil war remember this night in the May 1999 so this was a year

381
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:30,000
are you after the testing nuclear weapons general professor mosharraf who ended up being

382
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:40,000
during the first phase of the Afghan war in 2000 before September 1st September 11th nevad shareef history does repeat of anniversary

383
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:50,000
then the prime minister he is again the prime minister today by the way head then general provision

384
01:03:50,000 --> 01:04:00,000
who is the chief of army staff Orchestra in operation wear on uniform regular Pakistan forces of the Northern Light Infantry in Northern Light Infantry

385
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:10,000
credit into several sectors in Indian helico smear and Indian Territory and responded with trying to dislodge

386
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:20,000
90 forces previously this exact operation been attempted 1965 India launch airstrikes across the line of control and open the second front of Crossing

387
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:30,000
best time the bishop he responded very differently because of Pakistan's nuclear Association the BJP was

388
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:40,000
The Strand Penshurst and hair loss is because the threat of escalating the conflict deterred the BJP from into the same kind of

389
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:50,000
had an 18650 the India had so it it refused to allow air operations across the line of control so Indian aircraft could not cross line

390
01:04:50,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Hot Pursuit of Pakistan infiltrators and most importantly did not warrant open at the second front the police were India conventional advantage really

391
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:10,000
come to bear is on the international border here but India has a huge

392
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:20,000
in this plane second which is international portraits 0800 in a previous provocation India has always open up the second we can really bring a commercial power to bear

393
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Pakistan this time the BJP refuses to rent over it did not mobilise any of its mainstay can measure forces on the international border and did

394
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:40,000
open up a second front and so it took Indian forces a lot longer in the sustain much every losses in the kargil war because they had to expel the Pakistani forces

395
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:50,000
symmetrically so didn't have the virtue of airpower hidden behind Pakistani lines and it wasn't any ability to take

396
01:05:50,000 --> 01:06:00,000
map of this front by opening up a second front in the response is restrained because packets

397
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:10,000
what is a nuclear power so surely after September 11th here 2 months later 3 months later there was an attack

398
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Indian parliament Grace you had about a half a dozen gunman break through the barriers of the Indian Parliament House imaginative and attack on car receipt right there be the equivalent

399
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:30,000
you had a Jay Jays you Muhammad in joint attack on the Indian Parliament in Delhi right never heard of before

400
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:40,000
these Milton group which are normally supported by the Pakistani state would attack the Indian capital right so you had this attack

401
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:50,000
oh Bishop mysterious imagine the United States would do if a militant organisation attacked the US congress rate so you can imagine the out

402
01:06:50,000 --> 01:07:00,000
in India the time to limited war here across the line of control right so destroying Terrace camps across

403
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:10,000
under a lot of pressure from the US government because remember what's that we're immobilization for one Afghanistan this point right we need Pakistan United States needs

404
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:20,000
tonight be distracted by a conventional war with India can you imagine how that would have affected us we're not gonna stand if India and Pakistan going to convert 4

405
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:30,000
the lot of pressure on both sides to not go to Waratah deputy secretary see the time to carpeted gets on the phone is on the phone he said like twice a day with

406
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:40,000
BJP Origin m2 in a show restraint and for a while but then is the secondary attack in a town

407
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:50,000
call town car colour check in jammu which is an army town and the Jewish militants killed 36 Indian army families and so the point is this is

408
01:07:50,000 --> 01:08:00,000
peak of the crisis is enough is enough for the mobilize India three the column three three strike course is in the main offensive

409
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:10,000
what is the Indian army 800000 forces in total in immobilized in the assembly boxes which are much larger than a 60 km

410
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:20,000
in the three positions boys for attacks across international border so this is it becomes real for South Asia

411
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:30,000
mobilise his forces just on it as a Bluff and so does real concerned at the the BJP what authorised attacks and at this point

412
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Pakistan and gauges in some serious nuclear test 3 nuclear cable muscles without the present

413
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:50,000
to the owner of the Cross in a supporter that Pakistan may have no option with his nuclear weapons the US and the United Kingdom evacuate there an essential personnel

414
01:08:50,000 --> 01:09:00,000
very serious at this point after after these new

415
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:10,000
and again a lot of pressure from United States on India premiership odds play orders several months later the strike force back to the

416
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:20,000
the peace and can tell me the interior of India and later on she said look I don't I don't think that was high but I don't want to be responsible for starting war

417
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:30,000
answer there is a real Powerball with record of India to engage in this kind of conventional operation is Pakistan and defeated the Pakistan army there's a real risk in nuclear weapons will be used right

418
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:40,000
the third instance with the Bombay attacking 2008 to talk about beginning

419
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:50,000
so here right this was even more Addis in some ways than the parliament attack this wasn't a ragtag group of 6 guys in a car

420
01:09:50,000 --> 01:10:00,000
a dozen welltrain heavily on militants coming by sea from Karachi quarterback in now turns out by retired

421
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:10,000
play handlers the United States picked up signals intelligence and intercept between handlers in

422
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:20,000
star who were formed Isa officers quarterback in the operation is a attacked Bombay 170

423
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:30,000
it will in the media tends to downplay the number of westerners are deliberately targeted by the militant

424
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:40,000
l e t militants and your India was just a fire we are treated this attack

425
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:50,000
I was again paralyzed great so this time it's the congress government that the BJP government is making decisions and it doesn't immobilise forces time by the prime minister of my mum and sing

426
01:10:50,000 --> 01:11:00,000
you do not want to repeat a 2001 2002/1 immobilise Force and not do anything so what do we do and here we have the you know the

427
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Alice is the Indian policy community faces is any serious convention retaliation risk snooker escalation itself now and

428
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:20,000
the cabinet meeting so this is this report from the cabinet meeting where the Prime Minister and the Defence Minister for minister of finance minister home in

429
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:30,000
I'm eating and it was one of the just when the dust settle all the principles agreed that the unpredictable in the Pakistan side in the fear of this decision makers car for a just before

430
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:40,000
including the new corruption stymied any possible chance of military action in his behalf after 26/11 is there is what they're called the Bombay attacks

431
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:50,000
26th of November so there's real process now about how do you deter

432
01:11:50,000 --> 01:12:00,000
militant attacks against the India stayed in the first place and Pakistan has

433
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:10,000
has successfully determined in a conventional Power by lowering the nuclear threshold taking a play right out of the NATO Playbook threatening early nuclear use

434
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Indian forces to rent across the international border so now after what we have is more frequent and intense Christ is triggered by Pakistan

435
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:30,000
disable if they're in bold in by the shield of early nuclear used right knowing that India can't really retaliate with ground power right

436
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:40,000
I can get into we have some time for questions we get into why India hasn't tried to help an air strike option then gets in the politics of the Indian military the service rivalries

437
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:50,000
has the air force has always refused to to think about options that don't involve the army mobilising

438
01:12:50,000 --> 01:13:00,000
is the belief is there Pakistan with wood Italian on the ground and so the air force doesn't believe the standalone air options are possible without a

439
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:10,000
should be mobilized Pakistan if you're facing a conventional facing

440
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:20,000
John Fury with only grown because the size and growth rates of the two countries are so disproportionate the India's Gap is just going it's going it's going to be a yawning Gap at this point right

441
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:30,000
is it going forward how do you slow India down so there's one theory out there which is this periodic attacks on India's financial and

442
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:40,000
hubs kind of creating periodic crises get for an investor account skittish so you get periodic slowdowns be triggered by there so you can

443
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:50,000
hoedown India's economic growth potential if you make it risky to invest in India so that's one Siri out there the other Siri is Pakistan is always had crazies

444
01:13:50,000 --> 01:14:00,000
that is trained to attack good Christmas kill Indians bad creases cool Pakistanis and so they need it in the safety valve theory and they've always had a safety belt

445
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:10,000
it was customary now she is like down because Indian army knows how to prevent infiltration Cashmere or while I was going to Stan Wright

446
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:20,000
US military has to be asking why it is Guy speaking Punjabi and I'll be honest because there is a Punjabi train militants the only TV that have gone now don't understand it

447
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:30,000
and they're killing Americans and here now if you can turn them against the earliest a great ride the so there's a as long as you're not killing Pakistan is a good militants right and so

448
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:40,000
130 out there that this is the Pakistan states still views these militant groups as strategic assets of the state

449
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:50,000
perpetually attack in bleed India by 1000 cards and you know if you can get in through Cashmere if you can infiltrated by sea

450
01:14:50,000 --> 01:15:00,000
to Bombay great if you can you know hit deli great before nuclear weapons hitting Bombay Delhi really wrist serious conversion retaliation

451
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:10,000
you have nuclear weapons and an operation nuclear capability and tactical nuclear weapons to deter that convention retaliation those kinds of modest attacks and more possible

452
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:20,000
two kinds of theories out there

453
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:30,000
the people here again the more about those who were who were who had first annexe

454
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:40,000
interislander reports that you had Punjabi speaking right I mean most most of the most of the Afghan Mujahideen or pasta speaking

455
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:50,000
a lot of the ladies that was pretty the pretty 911 and they were supported find it and

456
01:15:50,000 --> 01:16:00,000
strong relationships between the ISI and some of the Mujahideen groups in Afghanistan that ended up being the Tauranga the only Tuesday they reckon it's Alma Park

457
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:10,000
the net worth of Pakistan had enough gunnison or very strong and they also have these other groups also write so they needed militants to go

458
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:20,000
quite what end of the Americans as well as in a car's Isa na it would be it would be these in the letnje shahamat so there

459
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Punjabi speaking militants well-trained Punjabi speaking militants fighting in Afghanistan alongside Pashto speaking haqqani network militants

460
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:40,000
you know that was a safety valve for a while and now I think this is why Pakistan may have an incentive your for a fight to continue Organics town for a while so I had some place to

461
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:50,000
is crazy for a while and worried about Indian influence in Afghanistan so that you know that there will be those Milton sweetbox into Pakistan

462
01:16:50,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Pakistan faces in an awful school attack recently you know there is a real Terrace in Pakistan also it's a family

463
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:10,000
good nautical Indians in America

464
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:20,000
yeah read I just I mean

465
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:30,000
so I think I didn't even a suggest a ladder I mean it is it is it is remarkable that the l e t

466
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:40,000
so after 2000-2002 the only tea was nominally band but they themselves and Harper said who is the

467
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:50,000
how did the early tea leaves openly not out in the tribal areas he lives outside Lahore in a town car Marika everybody knows where they are they open the fundraising he goes on TV

468
01:17:50,000 --> 01:18:00,000
calling for the death of Indians and openly right and the fact that he is it open question whether it's

469
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:10,000
support a passive support but at least the evidence suggests that at least passaporte is allowed to freely operate he's allowed to freely

470
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:20,000
organisation exists it could be shut down very is loose in the heart of Pakistan it's like 30 km from The Importer the Indians could hit it but they were

471
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:30,000
and put the network is allowed to recruit and operate openly we're not talking about it like the Northwest front though in a car booked in the

472
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:40,000
where is this is this is Heartland of Pakistan in so it is it is it offends credible I credibility like credibility to think that

473
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:50,000
it's not there isn't some stick policy to allow certain group to operate to some extent well thinking to Target the rest

474
01:18:50,000 --> 01:19:00,000
different house on different days but the security groups I think or allowed operators want those of the other goodnight

475
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:10,000
videos of Sydney is fine so some of those groups have been very very Fierce and are allowed to operate still and I can't

476
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:20,000
and the only tier as long as they're not killing Sony's in Punjab seems like the Pakistani state is this one to tolerate their assistance

477
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:30,000
cancel that an actress a policy and this is different from the call right we don't have I don't think I said something to do with that kind of proxy level militancy right we have to strategic assets

478
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:40,000
military organisations to try and we can the other state plus nuclear weapons to deter the retaliation so that I think what makes it particularly dangerous

479
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:50,000
clue here I do you have any is extremely frustrated right I think it worry in the United States is that if there's another mass casualty terrorist attack in Hindi

480
01:19:50,000 --> 01:20:00,000
how the BJP now you have prime minister a new prime minister who is by all accounts a little more aggressive than it's predecessors

481
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:10,000
and you know there's right now the stability in South Asia is predicated on Indian restraint following one of these mass casualty terrorist

482
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:20,000
so if there is another Bombay how will the BJP respond right there we can talk if anybody tried to call so we talk about that you just

483
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:30,000
if anyone ever wants to get in some of that the wheels got the basic idea is you know any has a commercial ads commercials security it has not used it yet

484
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:40,000
be there some believe that Pakistan's nuclear threat is a Bluff and India execute such conventional injectors below the nucleus raffle maybe maybe

485
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:50,000
pretty rescue protective we talk about tactical nuclear weapons that would at least at some point be the Bold to you know another pretty reliable maybe and

486
01:20:50,000 --> 01:21:00,000
you'll have is not just one refresh all but night and so you'll have to worry about one of them deciding that this is the end of the use nuclear weapons I think

487
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:10,000
it's a the Pakistani strategy is actually quite rational it's it's deterring it's deterring with the restaurant that we might use tactical nuclear weapons but also through a madman mechanism

488
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:20,000
nuclear weapons say one of our British might use if you come and that reinforces the rash on the term threat as well and so you know so far

489
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:30,000
yeah both and Cargill sorry I didn't in three instances cargo brockham and Bombay India has been relatively restrained as conventional

490
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:40,000
play ocean and it's response and so far that has taken India off india-pakistan off the excretory Highway

491
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:50,000
continue going for emotions in India I'm running very high visible Pakistan particularly in increase shelling across the line to control the pest

492
01:21:50,000 --> 01:22:00,000
are anything if there is a significant attack in a major city that involves the death of many Indian civilians still be a lot of pressure on on

493
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:10,000
prime minister ability to do something about it and then you know all better off because you have nuclear weapons potentially mixed with conventional conflict and that would be the best

494
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:20,000
I think there's something they were likely it says element of terrorist attacks mass casualty terrorist attacks at dinner exist in the Cold War that makes South Asia quite different I think

495
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:30,000
and so is there accommodation proxy forces in the arms race that I think makes it particularly unstable so I'm at the stuff

496
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:40,000
we are almost at 10 but I'm happy to take questions for a while if anybody has any for this afternoon to get it out yeah yeah

497
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:50,000
yeah so this is getting the escalation Thomas Road so Pakistan also has strategic weapons

498
01:22:50,000 --> 01:23:00,000
that put most of India's major cities in in retraite so the idea being that deters Indian retaliation for tactical nuke Pakistan

499
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Nicola used as a war terminating strategy because the address of the ideas into commercial forces attack Pakistan stands and fight commercially find that are losing these taxable

500
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:20,000
forces but now I have a secure second-strike capability also from Pakistan so India has no incentive to use a strategic nuclear weapons against Pakistani cities rugby

501
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:30,000
nuclear use on your forces operating on Pakistani soil that's already happened in my Willie was deli in Bombay for retaliator

502
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:40,000
not now absent that the strategic capability to write then you could easily retaliate and there will be no reciprocation for Pakistan but pockets and is trying to establish

503
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:50,000
escalation diamond so that it could use tactical nuclear weapons and that would be the end of it so anyway have no incentive to retaliate was strategic nuclear weapons against Pakistan there is some

504
01:23:50,000 --> 01:24:00,000
looking at lower ordering options for itself but there are some capabilities that could be used for softer targets

505
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:10,000
cities that India tries to develop tit-for-tat capabilities and then that's that's basically your escalation letter

506
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:20,000
swell in the back

507
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:30,000
22 often and then the core world pin I think there is a does a limit over once every

508
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:40,000
23 years is not nothing and you know there's always chatter there have been there in several instances where the Indian home Ministry claims I don't know how good

509
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:50,000
disrupted several attacks by Led on on Indians on India

510
01:24:50,000 --> 01:25:00,000
every 7 years I think you know that's that's that's not nothing and they also choose

511
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:10,000
strategic Mum's to do it so she looked at the timing of the attack on the Parliament two months after 9:11 just as

512
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:20,000
sunny us relationship is growing again maybe disable if you can get away with it because you are so going to protect you the Bombay

513
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:30,000
attack was just as then present mosharraf was there is discussion of including a Back channel final agreement

514
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:40,000
and the only tea and the India Focus militant actors video player spoilers and so

515
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:50,000
something as a composite dialogue I'm going between India and Pakistan in 2008 literally everybody knew what the final solution

516
01:25:50,000 --> 01:26:00,000
silver to India Pakistan look like Impreza musharraf was very serious about it this was spoil it with them Pakistan v doing that that deal in disrupting the diary so India had no often but it's

517
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:10,000
composite I live at 4 Bondi Parade and has a really restart it and so those strategic moments I think our our our chosen

518
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:20,000
bye bye Pakistani militants to attack in D

519
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:30,000
oh yeah that's it that's a whole so he's told her

520
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:40,000
who provided the uranium enrichment capability to Pakistan here or orchestrated network of global suppliers for the

521
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:50,000
for the centrifuge for both state policy right to he use that network to get North Korea it's centrifuge capability

522
01:26:50,000 --> 01:27:00,000
but whether with completed state support or acting on his own he also decided to make some money by Moonlighting maybe with

523
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Ryan and Lydia and there's Blue Da Ba Ford customer don't know who that is but you know there's a big day but also the packs and how influential if you can't really

524
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:20,000
the moving to the petone designs anyway paec which is he responsible petone

525
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:30,000
competing for designs and ownership of the Pakistani program so in Pakistan

526
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:40,000
pistol that's a dispute but some of the sum of the proliferation activities

527
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:50,000
it is unclear whether States possible whether there is some steak complicity and he detection Zone or the actor completely honest

528
01:27:50,000 --> 01:28:00,000
cells nuclear technology I mean

529
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:10,000
catalogue you could you can get the brochure for it so the it is true write that you know there was

530
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:20,000
you definitely have to let you know I'm just kind of interesting cos you're on in Pakistan or natural

531
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:30,000
sunny what are you know that natural in Iran is also been involved with the Bluetooth

532
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:40,000
that he would sell centrifuges to Ryan simple puzzling maybe was for personal gain would be a very strong explanation

533
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:50,000
there is some evidence here pressure rock in the late 1980s also for if this if they're interested in your in Richmond

534
01:28:50,000 --> 01:29:00,000
a trap so you know he passed on it but yeah I'll be there as there's no question that there's this is a big night proliferation failure

535
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:20,000
a bit like you have to live with some acid from possibility to do some of the stuff some people didn't know about it

536
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:30,000
the rain on the take rate which is entirely possible I'm currently the North Korean deal with a flu Pakistani 78 so they it was military

537
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:40,000
for the talk before centrifuge Cascade over the request that was different state to state the level of complexity other people in the park

538
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:50,000
I probably will be hard for me to believe they didn't but they probably made up in state policy last question I think then we going

539
01:29:50,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Pakistan

540
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:10,000
yes William Post

541
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:20,000
tonight's 98 but then after September 11th to Pakistan

542
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:30,000
recently I'm not a Pakistan expert in this case in a very like you know the empirical evidence for this is we don't know but packet

543
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:40,000
very vulnerable I mean I think a non-trivial proportion of their revenue comes from from us international aid but on the other hand

544
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:50,000
given the militancy problem I think most countries before a stable Pakistan to an unstable Pakistan and have you saying she's got a really

545
01:30:50,000 --> 01:31:00,000
the fabric of that state into it it's it's a very thin line you walk right and I think

546
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:10,000
and there is a belief in the radio station that was one of the other as I do need a Pakistan for against that serves or is a nuclear program but we couldn't deal with both at the same time

547
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:20,000
the week in the United States wasn't happy it wasn't like he was happy about the Pakistani nuclear program but it's certainly true that the exact it was willing to

548
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:30,000
by the way and tolerate certain point probably on the list is kind of an Evelyn nothing much you can do about it I'm not sure Telstra I actually think that there are a lot of leverage points we then I said could have had in

549
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:40,000
and then take advantage of them but that's also you know it's a ministration fighting this warm and I believe I have the bandwidth deal with both and I think that's kind of were they

550
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:50,000
in the 1980s to stop Pakistan from from becoming a ghost in the first place but now that they are through the hard to see what you can do

551
01:31:50,000 --> 01:32:00,000
put this situation

552
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:10,000
you either keep going incrementally the way it's been going well you take a big step

553
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:20,000
is going to do something while you're too slow

554
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:30,000
which is not if you can buy white skips

555
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:50,000
what's your name

556
01:32:50,000 --> 01:33:00,000
I think it was a real door I think it was a real does an app for tuning 2018 my mind saying and then foreign secretary short form and was going to be at MIT actually

557
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:10,000
3 at the centre for national studies with us you can but I believe the they were India was ready to do the

558
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:20,000
in 2008 and was ready to do this in 2008 so no elements of the Pakistani secure

559
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:30,000
and the party forces nearly or not and so it was just politically untenable after the Bombay attack for the

560
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:40,000
political leadership and soda spoilers the spoiler spoilt

561
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:50,000
but I'm in the politics of it will just no way that that can make it a survived if it if you continue with the

562
01:33:50,000 --> 01:34:00,000
the dialogue and it was also it was also the case where the they were they were elections with the next year read

563
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:10,000
I know where the composite I like could continue to bomb in your country could do that that's just unfortunate you know the unfortunate republics and I think the only team you that right

564
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:20,000
you probably this attack and you will kill the composite dialogue and a back and that's exactly what happened a maybe in it's interesting because it's sometimes you know you need an x in the

565
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:30,000
and Modi who is hawkish in the BJP has a credibility get the right on his side right he's protector his right flank which often test

566
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:40,000
India so he's an opportunity I think and I wouldn't be surprised if there's some movement toward it in this immigration provider don't know whether a text so I think you're right

567
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:50,000
all the pizza everybody knows what the final deal looks like there's something like you know there's one Hiccup about whether it's sequential or simultaneous

568
01:34:50,000 --> 01:35:00,000
do you know association of the Sea actually like everything else gets in it would you dated

569
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:10,000
maybe in a motor has 5 years so it's possible if anyone in India can do it I think it has to be something from the right the question of whether there's a will in partner willing

570
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Pakistan exactly so ok I think we're over time so we should I go to pick up my kids from daycare so thank you guys
