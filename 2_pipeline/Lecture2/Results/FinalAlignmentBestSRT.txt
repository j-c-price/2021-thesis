lectures\nare to cover some of\nthe major current issues\nin nuclear arms control\nand nonproliferation.\nSo we have the first lecture\ntoday on India and Pakistan,\nwhich is one of the world's\npossible flash points,\nmeaning that there's a path to\na possible nuclear war, which\nI won't go into Vipin Narang\nwill certainly spell out\nthe case.\nBut in my view in trying to\ndecide what to talk about,\nthis was a golden opportunity\nbecause Vipin is here,\nand he's an expert\non these issues.\nAnd I consider this, as I\nsay, one of the possible flash\npoints in the world, one of\nthe possible conceivable paths.\nNo path is super likely, if\nyou want to put it that way.\nBut the effects of\na nuclear exchange\nare catastrophic both for the\npeople who get hit, obviously,\nbecause a nuclear weapon--\nI don't have to tell you--\nis incredibly destructive.\nIn Hiroshima, something\nlike 40% of the population\nwas killed, more or less\ninstantly, burns or blasts.\nAnd probably another\n20%, 30% died\nwithin a year of radiation.\nSo in addition,\npeople have realized\nthat there are severe climate\neffects of a nuclear exchange.\nOne of the things that happens\nwith all the burning that\ngoes on is that soot is\nemitted into the atmosphere.\nThis is the opposite\nof global warming.\nThis is global cooling.\nThis is like a\nvolcanic explosion.\nAnd in about 1815, 1816,\nthere was a volcanic explosion\nin Asia.\nAnd there was a\nwinter without-- there\nwas a summer-- excuse me--\nthere was a summer without crops\nin Europe.\nAnd there was actually\nstarvation in Europe\ndue to this explosion.\nIt was a one time thing.\nThe climate models, for\neven a limited nuclear war\nin Southeast Asia, show that\nthis effect would probably\nlast 5 to 10 years\nand be global,\nfrom roughly 100\nnuclear weapons.\nSo there are papers.\nI can give people\nreferences if they want.\nThere is a paper\nin Physics Today\na few years ago about this.\nBut there are many\npapers on the subject.\nSo one of the things I want\nto say-- so the second lecture\nwill be on proliferation\nand uranium enrichment\nand the implications.\nSo these lectures will combine\nboth technology and policy.\nAnd finally, the last\nlecture I will give--\nand it's kind of an overview of\nwhere we stand on nuclear arms\ncontrol and\nproliferation-- I'll try\nto fill in some of the gaps.\nI'll talk about the\nnonproliferation review that's\ncoming up at the UN next spring.\nI'll talk about the outlook\nfor arms control as I see it.\nI want to talk a few\nminutes to the students\nbecause one of the things\nthat's happened over\nthe last few decades, since\nthe collapse of the Soviet\nUnion in about 1990,\npeople stopped worrying\nabout the bomb, so to speak.\nBefore that, there\nwas a lot of concern.\nStudents were asked to duck\nunder their desks and things\nlike that to protect themselves,\nwhich, of course, was totally\nridiculous.\nA wooden desk wouldn't do you\nmuch good in a nuclear war\nas you can well imagine.\nIt'll just probably knock you\non the head with something.\nGod knows what it would do.\nBut the issue has\nfallen off the table.\nAnd the thing that\nconcerns people\nmore on campus when-- if they\nthink about global issues,\nis climate change\nand global warming.\nBut this is an issue\nwhich has not gone away.\nIf anything, the probability\nof a nuclear exchange\nis higher now than a\ndecade ago unfortunately.\nAnd we have not\nsolved these problems.\nAnd there are political\nand economic problems.\nAnd I just want\nto say a few words\nabout some of the\nintellectual problems that\nneed to be solved.\nFor example, on a\ntechnical basis,\nthere are inspection issues.\nFor example, how do you\ninspect whether or not\na country is cheating on its\nnonproliferation obligations?\nHow do you look for\nweapons production\nor enrichment production?\nThese are very difficult issue,\nand they're very difficult\ntechnical issues.\nAnd then there are\nissues in which\nyou have to combine\ntechnical issues with policy.\nFor example, if we're\ngoing to go down\nto a very small\nnumber of weapons--\nas you want to do\nfor nuclear arms\ncontrol-- then cheating\nwith a small number--\nparticularly if\nyou're going to go\nto 0-- cheating with a small\nnumber becomes a bigger issue.\nSo verification issues are\nvery important, reinventing\nthe bomb, if you\nreally want to zero.\nSo there are all kinds\nof intellectual issues\nthat need to be worked out,\nboth historical, technical,\nand political.\nAnd there are many opportunities\nfor research in these areas,\nUROP, some theses.\nSo I just want to\npoint that out.\nAnd there are also positions\nin government and NGOs.\nIn the last semester, we\nhad several major arms\ncontrol negotiators\nin the US government,\nincluding Rose\nGottemoeller who was\nthe chief negotiator on the US\nside for the New START Treaty,\nsaid she was particularly\nexcited to give a talk at MIT\nbecause we really needed a\ngeneration of technically\ntrained people to go into\nnuclear arms control.\nAnd she made a special plea,\nso I want to pass that along.\nSo I'm going to get\nto today's lecture.\nVipin Narang, he's a professor\nat the MIT political science\ndepartment and the\nSecurity Studies program.\nHe's got a BS and MS in\nchemical engineering.\nHe's got a degree\nfrom Balliol College,\nwhere I spent a very\nhappy semester at Oxford.\nAnd he's written extensively\non nonproliferation and issues\nof arms control, deterrence,\nparticularly with respect\nto Southeast Asia.\nAnd he's got a book\nrecently published\non regional powers and\ninternational conflict.\nSo Vipin?\nVIPIN NARANG: Great.\nThanks Aaron.\nThanks for the kind introduction\nand for organizing this.\nSo as Aaron said,\nI'm a professor\nat the political\nscience department,\nand I work primarily on nuclear\nstrategy and proliferation.\nAnd so what I\nthought I'd do today\nwas talk about--\ngive an overview\nof nuclear proliferation and the\nconsequences of proliferation\nin South Asia, between\nIndia and Pakistan, which\nis-- as Aaron mentioned-- an\nactive and ongoing conflict\nwhere the threat of\nconventional war is persistent.\nAnd there are periodic\nmilitarized crises\nbetween India and Pakistan\nthat put both countries\nat a risk of conventional\nconflict every now and then.\nAnd now that both sides, both\nstates, have nuclear weapons,\nthe question is what the\nlikelihood of escalation\nto nuclear level is.\nJust as a preview of my\nown thinking and writing\non the subject, I think India\nand Pakistan have so far\nbeen lucky in that the\nconventional conflict is not\nyet escalated to\nthe nuclear level.\nBut that's not a foregone\nconclusion going forward.\nI'll talk a little\nbit about that.\nAnd it's one of\nthe regions where\nthere is still\nactive arms racing\nbetween India and Pakistan.\nAnd so I'll talk a\nlittle bit about that\nand what the dynamics have been\nwith the nuclear strategies\nand what the effects on the\nrelationship between India\nand Pakistan are.\nIf you have any questions\nat all during lecture,\ndon't hesitate to stop me.\nI know there are diverse\nbackgrounds here,\npeople from different\ndepartments, undergraduates,\ngraduate students.\nI'll go through some basic\ntheoretical material first.\nIf everybody's OK\nwith that, we can\nmove through that\npretty quickly and talk\nabout India and Pakistan.\nSo as I said, India and\nPakistan are both in the process\nof building up their\nnuclear delivery systems\nand their nuclear arsenals.\nThis is a picture of a\nShaheen missile, which\nis a Pakistani long-- it's a\nmedium range ballistic missile\nin the Pakistani inventory.\nAnd it's based off of a Chinese\nexport missile, the M-class\nexports.\nAnd both are actively testing\nshort and long range cruise\nand ballistic missiles as\ntheir inventories are growing.\nAnd that is one of\nthe concerns, I think,\nas we talk about South Asia."], "670": [1, 110, "know what these\npictures are from.\nSo in November, November\n26, 2008-- two weeks\nbefore my wife and I\ngot married in Delhi\nactually-- a group nominally\na sponsored and based\nin Pakistan, the\nLashkar-e-Taiba,\norchestrated a pretty\ndaring sea-launch attack\nagainst Bombay where about a\ndozen militants, led by the one\nsurvivor from the militant\ngroup Ajmal Kasab pictured here,\nsieged the Taj Hotel, the\nOberoi Hotel, the Chabad\nHouse in Bombay and killed over\n170 Indians and Westerners.\nAnd the Indian government\nwas faced with the decision\nabout how to respond to this.\nThis was the third provocation\nthat the Indian government\nbelieve was sponsored\nby Pakistan since 1998,\nthe year in which they\ntested nuclear weapons.\nAnd the question\nfacing Indian leaders,\nhow do we respond\nto a state that\nsponsors militant attacks\nagainst our metropolitan--\nor metropoles,\ntargets our hotels\nand our financial center, when\nthey have nuclear weapons?\nAnd the worry in the\nIndian government\nwas that nuclear weapons had\nemboldened Pakistan to sponsor\nthese groups who were\nperpetrating more daring\nand audacious attacks\nagainst India.\nAnd because Pakistan\nhad nuclear weapons,\nIndia didn't have a\nconventional retaliatory option\nto punish Pakistan\nfor these attacks.\nAnd so the Indian\ngovernment, for a decade,\nhas been trying to deal\nwith what they believe\nis a policy paralysis about\ndealing with a Pakistan that\nis more willing to support\nmilitant organizations\nto attack India now that\nit has nuclear weapons."], "780": [2, 60, "I'll talk a little bit about\nbasic deterrence theory.\nIn political science\nand in economics,\nthe core of nuclear strategy,\nboth in the Cold War and now,\nis deterrence theory.\nSo we'll talk a\nlittle bit about that.\nHopefully, it's not too basic.\nI don't need to talk about\nthe basics of nuclear weapons\nto a physics audience.\nWe'll go through\nit really briefly,\nand some of the choices\nstates have to make\nand how they operationalize\ntheir arsenal, which\nare really important in the\nIndia and Pakistan context.\nI'll talk about the\ncauses of and the process\nof nuclearization in South Asia,\nhow and why India and Pakistan\nacquired nuclear weapons.\nAnd then I'll close\nwith the consequences\nand where we are\ntoday, focusing mostly\non the period since 1990.\nMay 1998 is the break point\nin the India, Pakistan\nnuclear equation.\nThat's when India, led by\nthe then BJP government,\ntested nuclear weapons,\nfollowed three weeks later\nby the Pakistani government.\nI'll close with\nsome conclusions.\nSo basic deterrence theory.\nThe definition of\ndeterrence, very simple--"], "840": [3, 190, "This is all inspired by guys\nlike Tom Schelling, Herman\nKahn, Albert Wohstetter.\nAnybody familiar with\nCold War nuclear strategy,\nthis will be familiar to you.\nSo basic deterrence\ntheory, in any context,\nis trying to preserve\nthe status quo\nby threatening unacceptable cost\nto an opponent or an adversary\nif they do x, some\nspecified action.\nSo if you do x, I will do y.\nAnd the idea is we\npreserve the status quo.\nAnd the idea is that y, the\npunishment that you impose\non your adversary\nopponent, should\nbe greater than the benefits\nof them achieving whatever\ntheir objective is,\nx, such that they\nare deterred from\nundertaking the action.\nTom Schelling used to love\nexamples with children.\nSo I have an\n18-month-old son myself,\nand he's starting to\nunderstand things.\nAnd as children get\nolder, deterrence\nby punishment example\nthat Tom Schelling used\nwas if your child\ndoes something bad,\nyou punish them by\nsending to their room,\ndenying them dinner, time out.\nSo there's some punishment\nafter the fact if they do x.\nIn another example is if you\nhit me, I will kill your mother.\nSo there's a punitive aspect\nto the deterrence threat\nsuch that the punishment exceeds\nthe benefit of whatever am\nadversary's objective would be.\nSo in the Cold War, the\ndeterrence by denial threat\nwas counterforce.\nWe were going to disarm and\ntarget their own nuclear forces\nto make it impossible\nfor them to carry out\ntheir first strike.\nSo in a case where\nsomebody's attacking me,\na deterrence by\ndenial threat would\nbe instead of\nkilling your mother,\nI cut you're arm off\nso you can't attack me.\nAnd presumably, the cost\nof cutting your arm off,\nso you cannot achieve your\nobjective in the first place,\nis sufficient to deter\nyou from undertaking it.\nSo a good way to think about\nthis deterrence by punishment\nis we will punish you\nwith such severe cost,\nafter you undertake the\naction, such that you'll\nhave no incentive--\nrational incentive\nto do so verses we will\nratchet up the costs\nwhile you try to achieve the\nobjective such that you won't\nbe able to in the first place.\nSo I think it's an\nimportant distinction when\nwe think about nuclear strategy\neven in the South Asia case.\nBut in the Cold\nWar, the distinction\nwas counterforce\nversus countervalue.\nSo for those familiar with\nCold War nuclear strategy,\nwhen we threatened to\ntarget Soviet cities\nor their economic or\nindustrial capacity,\nthat was largely a deterrence\nby punishment strategy.\nSo in the event\nthat they launched\na conventional or a first\nnuclear strike against us,\nwe would retaliate\nagainst their cities.\nThe alternative was, and\nthis was a big debate\nearly in the Cold War, in a\ncase of a conventional conflict,\nwe would launch nuclear weapons\nat their nuclear weapons\nsuch that they would\nnot have the ability\nto launch those weapons at the\nUnited States or its allies."], "1030": [4, 210, "We call them the three C's.\nSo you need to\nhave the capability\nto impose the threat\nthat you're promising.\nSo if you're threatening to\ndestroy an adversary's cities\nin the event they\ndo something, you\nneed to have the\ncapability do that.\nSo you need some\nexplosive capability,\nbut you also, most importantly,\nin the nuclear sense,\nneed a delivery capability.\nYou need to be able\nto hit their cities.\nAnd it needs to be\ntransparent to the adversary.\nIt needs to be credible.\nAnd this term credibility and\nthe concept of credibility\nis what dogged Cold War strategy\nand still dogs nuclear strategy\ntoday.\nCredibility is the\nhardest part of this.\nHow could you threaten what was\ntantamount to mutual suicide\nand have it be credible\nby your adversary?\nSo in the event of-- so in\nthe Cold War, a good example\nis if the Soviet Union\ntook West Berlin,\nwas it really credible that\nthe United States would\nthreaten to launch\nhundreds of nuclear weapons\nat Soviet cities?\nThe Soviet Union\nprobably didn't think so.\nSo in a deterrence by\npunishment versus deterrence\nby denial trade off, which one\ndo you think is more credible?\nSo in the case where an\nattacker is coming at you,\nis it more credible\nto threaten to kill\ntheir mother in response\nor to cut off their arm?\nWhat is an attacker\nmore likely to believe?\nIt is disproportionate\nto threaten\ncertain punitive action, and\nso it is often more credible--\nand this is where the trade\noff between-- the debate early\nin the Cold War about deterrence\nby punishment versus deterrence\nby denial turned on the\ncredibility differences\nbetween the two.\nThat deterrence by denial\nseemed to be more credible.\nThe adversary is more\nlikely to believe\nthat you would try to stop them\nfrom achieving their objectives\nthan to kill millions\nof innocent civilians\nthat had nothing to do with\nthe fight in the first place\nafter something had\nalready happened.\nAnd so the United States\nended up threatening both.\nAnd part of it was that\nthe size of the US arsenal\nmade it possible\nto threaten both.\nBut I think there were\nmany strategists who\nbelieved that the deterrence\nby denial missions\nwere still more credible\nto the adversary.\nBut at the heart of deterrence\nis this issue of credibility.\nAnd the third C\nis communication.\nThe adversary needs\nto know that you\nhave the capability\nand the credibility\nto threaten the punishment or\ndeterrence by denial threat\nthat you make.\nSo you have to make a threat.\nIT has to be public.\nThe adversary has to\nknow what the threat is.\nThe adversary needs\nto know what objective\nyou are laying a red line\ndown for and that you\nhave the capability to inflict\nthe punishment that you\nthreaten.\nSo there's a huge\namount of transparency\nthat is required for\ndeterrence to operate.\nHas anyone seen Dr.\nStrangelove, the movie?\nWhat's the problem\nwith the doomsday\nmachine in Dr. Strangelove?\nThere's a great line.\nWhat's the point of a\ndoomsday machine if you\ndon't tell anybody about it.\nThe adversary needs to know\nthat undertaking certain actions\nwill result in some punishment\nfor deterrence to operate.\nSo nuclear weapons and--\ndeterrence, as a concept,"], "1240": [5, 100, "The concept of\nratcheting up the cost\nto trying to deter an adversary\npredates nuclear weapons\nby centuries, since\nthe dawn of warfare.\nBut nuclear weapons\nfundamentally\nalter deterrence equations\nfor several reasons.\nOne, the explosive yields,\nand as Aaron mentioned,\neven the Hiroshima\nbomb, 20 kilotons\ncould kill 100,000 people.\nYou could kill cities, entire\ncities, with a single warhead.\nBut more than that,\nthe missile age really\nchanged how deterrence\ncould operate because, prior\nto nuclear weapons,\nwhat was the most\ndestructive military technology\nin States' inventory?\nDoes anyone know?\nBefore nuclear weapons\nin World War II,\nhow did the United States and\nAllies and Germany attack?\nAUDIENCE: Strategic bombing.\nVIPIN NARANG: Strategic bombing\nand fire bombing, right?\nAnd the problem was that you had\nto send hundreds of airplanes\nand sorties into enemy territory\nto inflict that kind of damage.\nSo your own pilots and\nair force was a risk.\nNow, with the missile age,\nyou can launch warheads\nat no risk to your pilots.\nThe numbers that\nyou were required\nto destroy entire cities\nwere much smaller.\nSo you could ratchet up\nthe cost really quickly\nwithout incurring much\ncost yourself in the way\nthe strategic bombing and fire\nbombing required of a state\nprior to the advent\nof the nuclear age.\nAnd one shouldn't underestimate\nthe psychological impact\nof an adversary being able\nto destroy entire cities\nwith a single\nwarhead, from afar,\nat very low risk to itself."], "1340": [6, 10, "of imposing punishment\nin ways that didn't\nexist prior to the nuclear age.\nSo nuclear weapons fundamentally\nchanged deterrence equations."], "1350": [7, 120, "Is everyone familiar with\nthe basics of uranium,\nplutonium nuclear weapons?\nSo I don't need to go\nthrough enriched uranium.\nplutonium from reprocessing.\nThose are basic fission weapons\nand boosted fission weapon.\nSo what is important,\nI think, is\nmost regional powers are\noperating-- so India, Pakistan,\nSouth Africa when they\nhad nuclear weapons.\nA little known\nfact, South Africa\nhad nuclear weapons\nfrom 1979 to about 1991.\nMost states start with\nfission weapons, move\nto boosted fission weapons.\nThe advanced nuclear\npowers have fusion weapons.\nMost of the United\nStates' nuclear inventory\nis composed of thermo-- these\nare thermonuclear weapons.\nSo when you think of\nthe A-bomb, that's\nfission and boosted\nfission weapons.\nThe H--bomb are fusion weapons.\nThe United States has extremely\nadvanced dial up, dial down\nyield nuclear weapons.\nBut they're all\nthermonuclear weapons\nwhere there's a primary that\nignites a fusion secondary.\nBut most regional powers\nare operating here.\nSo North Korea, India, Pakistan.\nIsrael is assumed to have\nboosted fission devices.\nBut it's possible they\nhave fusion weapons.\nIt's unknown.\nThey have never\ntested or acknowledged\ntheir nuclear forces.\nWell, Britain is\nbasically an adjunct force\nof the United States.\nThey lease their\nweapons from the United\nStates for their tridents, so\nthose are basically US weapons.\nThe French have fusion weapons.\nBut India and Pakistan are\noperating in boosted fission\nrange.\nI mean that's important.\nWhen you can get\nto megaton yields,\nyou are talking about\ncharacteristically different\nweapons.\nThe number that\nwould be required\nto destroy an entire\ncity are much lower\nonce you have fusion weapons.\nBut obviously, a fission\nor boosted fission device\ncould do a lot of\ndamage as well."], "1470": [8, 400, "you're only halfway there\nin terms of operationalizing\nnuclear arsenal.\nI think this is\noften forgotten when\nwe talk about the\nproliferation process.\nStates need more than\njust nuclear weapons\nand warheads-- functional\nand reliable warheads--\nto have a nuclear arsenal.\nThey need delivery\ncapabilities, right?\nSo the first\nquestion you have is,\nhow many and what type\nof nuclear weapons\ndo I want to have?\nIndia and Pakistan are still\nanswering this question.\nIt is unclear how much is\nenough for India and Pakistan.\nIt is unclear how much\nis enough for China.\nChina has about-- it's\nestimated in the 200 to 400\nthermonuclear weapon\nrange arsenal size.\nBut faced with US\nmissile defenses,\nconventional counterforce\ncapabilities,\nit's unclear how much\nis enough for China.\nYou need to be able to--\na big piece of answering\nthis question is-- a big\nconcept in the Cold War\nwas secure second\nstrike capability.\nSo we were worried\nabout-- the United\nStates was worried about a bolt\nout of the blue first strike.\nYou would lose n\nnumber of weapons.\nYou needed to have enough that\nwould be able to survive that\nnot only in terms of numbers,\nbut in deployment modes,\nwhere they were based\nand how they were based,\nto be able to retaliate\nback with certainty\nagainst the Soviet Union such\nthat it deterred the Soviet\nfrom trying to\nundertake what is known\nas the splendid first\nstrike in the first place.\nA splendid first strike being\nthe ability to fully wipe out\nyour nuclear arsenal.\nSo secure second strike\ncapability for states is when\nthey achieve a level of numbers\nand deployment modes such that\nan adversary cannot be confident\nthat it could fully disarm that\nstate's nuclear arsenal.\nOther question is, how\ndo you deliver them?\nSo most states\nstart with aircraft.\nYou've got aircraft.\nYou rig them to carry\nnuclear weapons.\nBut what's the problem with\naircrafts as a nuclear delivery\ncapability?\nAUDIENCE: You have to get inside\nVIPIN NARANG: Yeah.\nYou have to penetrate\nenemy defenses, right?\nYou're not going to get\nthere without a fight.\nAnd so it's not the ideal\ntype of delivery capability.\nWe have strategic bombers\nwith huge complements\nof escort aircraft.\nThey were not survivable.\nThe advantage to aircraft\nis you can recall them.\nThey're piloted so you\ncan bring them back.\nThe disadvantage is they still\nhave to penetrate enemy air\nforces-- air defenses.\nSorry.\nSo then the United States\nand most regional powers\nare attracted to ballistic\nmissiles of various types.\nBallistic missiles\nhave the advantage\nthat you can launch\nthem from afar.\nThey have different ranges,\nliquid fuel, solid fuel.\nIt's not risky for the user.\nThey can't be recalled though.\nBut they're different\nbasing modes,\nso you can have land-based\nballistic missiles.\nWe have ICBM silos in\nWyoming and North Dakota.\nYou can have mobile\nballistic missiles on land.\nThe United States\nmoved quickly to\nsea-based ballistic\nmissiles, SLBMs.\nWhy?\nWhy do you think\nsea-based is attractive,\nat least for the United States?\nAUDIENCE: The enemy can't\nfind them hopefully.\nVIPIN NARANG: So in theory,\nif your subs are quiet enough,\nthey are virtually\n100% survivable\nbecause they're very\ndifficult to track\nif your subs are quiet enough.\nAnd this was something--\nthere's an assumption\nthat once a state acquires\na sea-based capability,\nit has a survivable\nsecond strike force.\nThat's true probably\nin the US case,\nbut other states' SSBNs, the\nsea-based ballistic missile\nnuclear submarines, are not\nquiet as the United States is.\nThere is increasing evidence\nto show that we were pretty\ngood at tracking Soviet SSBNs.\nWe're pretty good at tracking\nsubs during the Cold War.\nI don't know how much\nwe track them now.\nI mean you have to\nassume-- Soviet SSBNs,\nas the later generations\nbecame quieter,\nand we're still pretty\ngood at attracting them.\nYou can imagine first\ngeneration Chinese SSBNs,\nIndian SSBNs are\ngoing to be so loud.\nSome of them are\nnot nuclear powered.\nThey're diesel\npowered, which actually\nhelps with the noise signature.\nBut it is not\nnecessarily the case\nthat all states that acquire\nsea-based capabilities\nare going to have\nsurvivable second strike.\nBut this is the attraction\nof a sea-based force.\nA submarine-based\nnuclear force is\nmore survivable than land-based\nforce because land-based force,\nwith all the [INAUDIBLE]\nout there now,\nyou can track-- you know\nwhere launch sites might be,\nwhere they may flush\nout land-based forces,\nso then you can target them.\nIncreasingly, some states\nled by the United States\nare attracted to cruise\nmissiles as nuclear delivery\ncapabilities, Tomahawks.\nWe have a Tomahawk land and\nair-based nuclear version.\nThe French have an air\nlaunched cruise missile,\nwhich is a mainstay of their\nnuclear force structure.\nIndia and Pakistan are also\nlooking at cruise missiles\nbecause they can-- what's the\nadvantage of cruise missiles?\nWhat's the worry now\nwith ballistic missiles?\nAUDIENCE: They might\nshoot them down.\nVIPIN NARANG: So missile\ndefenses and the advent\nof missile defenses is starting\nto threaten the survivability\nof ballistic\nmissiles, so one shift\nis to cruise\nmissiles, which fly--\nthey have lower altitudes.\nThey can be more\neasily controlled,\nso there's more\nrecallability, I think,\nwith cruise missiles than\nwith ballistic missiles,\nbut primarily to defeat\nmissile defenses.\nThird question is, how\ndo you manage them?\nSome states put their nuclear\nforces under military control.\nSome states put them under\nvery firm civilian control.\nThis is a question the\nUnited States wrestled\nwith during the Cold War.\nInitially, the Department\nof Atomic Energy\nmanaged the nuclear pits\nin the United States.\nIt was under very\nfirm civilian control.\nAnd then as it became clear\nthat the United States would\nhave to delegate some actual\nnuclear forces to the Army\nin Western Europe for\ntactical nuclear weapons,\nthe US arsenal came under\nmilitary management,\nbut still under\ncivilian authority.\nOther states like\nPakistan are completely\nunder military\ncontrol, and we'll"], "1870": [9, 170, "But fundamentally, the\nquestion that regional powers\nin particular have\nto face, in ways\nthat the superpowers\ndidn't as much as,\nis what are you trying to\ndeter with nuclear weapons?\nWhy are you attracting\nnuclear weapons,\nand what are you using\nthem for in your larger\nstrategic policy?\nSo some states need\nnuclear weapons\njust to deter nuclear\nuse against them.\nStates, like China for example,\nwhich have huge geographies,\n3 million men under arms,\ndefense in depth strategy\naren't really facing\nconventional threats\non land the way that the US and\nSoviet Union were facing off\nin Western Europe.\nSo China and India\nboth primarily\nhave nuclear weapons to deter\nnuclear use against them.\nSo you are worried about\na nuclear armed adversary.\nYou don't want your adversary\nto have nuclear weapons\nand you not have the\nability to retaliate.\nYou're really using\nnuclear weapons\nto deter nuclear\nuse against you.\nYou can then rely on what we\ncall an assured retaliation\nstrategy.\nYou just need to be\nable survive what\nmight be a first\nstrike against you\nand retaliate with\nnuclear weapons\nagainst your adversaries\npopulation centers.\nThis is your classic deterrence\nby punishment strategy.\nNuclear weapons don't\nneed to be on high alert.\nRetaliation doesn't\nneed to be immediate.\nIt just needs to\nbe certain, and you\ndon't need tactical\nnuclear weapons\nbecause you're not using nuclear\nweapons on conventional forces\nthat might be attacking you.\nSo this allows for much\nmore centralized, recessed\nmanagement if that's your aim.\nIf your aim is to deter\nconventional aggression--\nthis was the US and NATO\nduring the Cold War.\nWe had conventional\ninferiority in Europe.\nIn order to offset the\nconventional capability\nof the Warsaw Pact\nand the Soviet Union,\nthe United States\nneeded nuclear weapons--\nthe threat of tactical\nnuclear weapons\nto offset that differential.\nAnd we needed to threaten to\nuse nuclear weapons first.\nIf Warsaw Pact nuclear\nconventional forces\ncame crashing in\na Western Europe,\nthe United States\nvery explicitly\nthreatened to use\ntactical nuclear weapons\nagainst advancing\nWarsaw Pact forces.\nUnlike in the assured\nretaliation case,\nyou can say, look, I have\na no first use policy.\nI won't use nuclear\nweapons unless you use them\nagainst

Pakistan is primarily worried\nabout Indian conventional\nsuperiority.\nAnd having been at the\nreceiving end of dismemberment\nfrom India in 1971,\nwhich I'll talk about,\nPakistan has\noperationalized a posture\nthat is very aggressive, very\noriented towards battlefield\nnuclear weapons against any\nconventional forces that might\ncross the international border.\nAnd so they

the Indian military program\ngets its motivation, initially,\nfrom its experiences in\n'62 and '64 with China.\nAnd to avoid nuclear coercion\nin the future against China,\nIndia hedges under\nthe Nehru years\nand then the subsequent\nleadership under Indira Ghandi.\nIt does also have these\npersistent wars with Pakistan.\nBut it has conventional\nsuperiority,\nand there was really\nnever any talk\nabout needing nuclear weapons\nto deter the Pakistanis.\nSo India had a civilian\nnuclear program.\nIt got a CANDU reactor Canada.\nSome of the heavy waters was\nsupplied by the United States,"], "2190": [12, 210, "And then in 1974,\nIndira Ghandi authorizes\nwhat's known at the time-- under\nthe Atoms for Peace program,\nthere was a category known as\na Peaceful Nuclear Explosion,\nwhich was-- I mean there\nare legitimate uses, it\nwas believed at the\ntime, for nuclear.\nLike, if you needed to\nclear large swaths of land\nfor dams for example.\nAnd India had some\npotential uses for this,\nbut it didn't\nreally fool-- I mean\na peaceful nuclear explosion\nis still a nuclear explosion.\nIt wasn't, however, a warhead.\nI mean this thing\nwas a rickety--\nI think was it was eight\nmeters in diameter device.\nI mean it was a hulking,\nunstable, rickety fission\ndevice that they\ntested in 1974-- it\nwasn't suitable for\na military program.\nIt wasn't miniaturized.\nIt didn't have-- it was\neven suitable for delivery\nby aircraft.\nYou'd have to throw it out\nthe back of a cargo plane.\nI mean it still gave\nthem, certainly,\nthe physics of being able\nto sustain fission and have\nspherical compression.\nAll of that was-- and it\nwas a plutonium device,\nso it wasn't trivial.\nBut it wasn't a nuclear\nweapon in the sense of the way\nthat we think of.\nSo a lot of work was still\nyet to be done after 1974,\nbut it demonstrated that Indian\nscientists had the ability\nto at least design\nrudimentary nuclear weapons.\nThere are several\nexplanations for why\nit tested in '74, as\na general security\nenvironment-- I talked about\nChina-- persistent wars\nwith Pakistan.\nThey had just won the 1970\nwar with Pakistan-- 1971 war\nwith Pakistan, which\nsplit Pakistan in two.\nI'll talk about that.\nThat was the real motivation\nfor the Pakistani program.\nBut the real explanation\nis a combination\nof domestic politics\nand the power\nof the scientists in India.\nSo Indira Ghandi was\nfacing a potential series\nof losses in state governments.\nShe wanted a big win.\nThere were several very\nprominent Indian physicists\nand engineers who promised a big\nboost in her electoral fortunes\nif she tested a nuclear\nweapon, and they really\nwanted to test a nuclear\nweapon because they\nhad bee working on it.\nScientists like to test the\nthings that they work on.\nAnd they had been doing this\npersistently for several years.\nAnd she then found her\nopportunity in 1974\nwhen, right before a\nseries of state elections,\nshe authorized the test.\nEmpirically, the\ntest didn't actually\nhelp her that much electorally,\nbut there was a belief\nthat it might.\nAnd so that was some of the\nmotivations for the test.\nFrom 1974 until about\n1989, for about 15 years,\nIndia's nuclear program went\ninto effective dormancy.\nThere was no high\nlevel authorization\nfrom Indira Gandhi, or her son\nwho later became prime minister\nafter her assassination in\n1984, for the militarization\nof the program.\nSo India's scientists\nworked on some of the--\ndid some of the theoretical\nwork for miniaturization,\ngetting India in a place\nwhere if it had to militarize\na program, it could.\nBut there was no actual physical\nworked done on that after 1974.\nPakistan faced a somewhat\ndifferent security environment."], "2400": [13, 430, "faced China's nuclear test--\nbut never really faced\nthe threat of a massive\nconventional invasion\nfrom China, really\nwanting nuclear weapons\nto deter the Chinese\nnuclear threat, not\nthe Chinese\nconventional threat--\nPakistan was really\nscarred by the 1971 war.\nSo the 1971 war was the\nwar in which East Pakistan\nwas birthed into Bangladesh.\nSo there was a refugee\ncrisis the West Pakistan\nand East-- so Pakistan\nat birth, in 1947,\nwas split non-contiguous\nwith India in the middle.\nYou had East and West Pakistan.\nWest Pakistan was\ndominated by Punjab.\nEast Pakistan was dominated\nby Bangladeshis-- Bengalis.\nSorry.\nLater Bangladeshis.\nBengalis.\nSo there was ethnic tension\nbetween Punjabis and Bengalis.\nThe Punjabis dominated\nthe politics of Pakistan.\nBengalis felt like\nthey were second class\ncitizens in Pakistan.\nThat created political tension.\nAnd there was an\nuprising in 1971.\nIndia intervened on\nbehalf of the Bengalis\nto split East Pakistan\noff of a West Pakistan.\nNow, if you're India, this is a\nhuge strategic victory, right?\nYou had two flanks of\nPakistan surrounding you,\nand you were able to make\nthem two independent countries\nwith the benefit that you helped\nbirth Bangladesh from Pakistan.\nSo it's not like\nthey would be allies\nagainst you in a conflict.\nSo strategically this worked\nout pretty well for India.\nBut for West Pakistan,\nnow present day Pakistan,\nthis was a pretty scary moment.\nYour east wing is\namputated, and it was\nat the hands of the Indians.\nSo as early as 1965,\nwhen it became clear\nthat India might look at nuclear\nweapons because of China,\nZulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was\nthe prime minister that ended up\nauthorizing the program\nthrough the 1970s,\nsaid \"we will eat grass or\nleaves or even go hungry,\nbut we will get a\nbomb of our own.\"\nIt's one of his famous quotes.\nRemember, this was\nsaid as early as 1965.\nBut after the 1971\nwar-- in January 1972,\nso right after 1971 war, Bhutto\nauthorizes the nuclear weapons\nprogram with express intent of\na militarized nuclear weapons\nprogram to deter Indian\nconventional power.\nSo it wasn't because of the\nIndian PNE, which was 1974.\nPakistan's nuclear\nweapons program\npredates India's 1974 test.\nThe real motivation\nwas the 1971 war.\nPakistan could not suffer\nthe conventional defeat\nat the hands of\nthe Indians again.\nAnd so Pakistan's nuclear\nprogram was triggered.\nFor a state that was essentially\ndesperate for nuclear weapons,\nPakistan tried all\npossible avenues.\nSo you had the uranium pathway,\nwhich was led by AQ Khan.\nEveryone's familiar\nwith AQ Khan?\nYes we Khan?\nHorrible, horrible joke.\nI apologize.\nSo he essentially stole\nthe URENCO designs.\nURENCO is a European consortium.\nHe stole it from\nthe Netherlands.\nHe worked at URENCO.\nFrom the inside, he\nstole the blueprints\nfor what ended up being the P1.\nAnd then he modified it\nlater to be P2 designs.\nSo he stole the\nURENCO centrifuge\ndesigns from URENCO itself\nwhere he was an employee.\nHe went back to\nBhutto and said, look,\nI can deliver a nuclear\nweapons program.\nAnd they set up cascades\nof the P1s at Kahuta,\nwhich Pakistan would\ndeny through the 1980s,\nwas a uranium\nenrichment facility.\nThe then president,\nGeneral Zia, referred to it\nas a goat shed repeatedly in\ninteractions with the United\nStates.\nThe problem was what\nhappened in 1979?\nCharlie Wilson's War, anyone?\nAUDIENCE: Iran.\nVIPIN NARANG: Well, also Iran.\nOK, that's true.\nYou had the Iran Hostage Crisis\nand the revolution in Iran.\nBut you also had what\nelse, December 1979?\nAUDIENCE: Soviet invasion.\nVIPIN NARANG: Yes,\nChristmas invasion.\nSo the Soviets\ninvade Afghanistan.\nAnd all of a sudden, Pakistan\nis America's-- one of the most\nuseful countries in the\nworld for the United States\nbecause the United\nStates decides to supply\nthe mujahideen in Afghanistan\nto fight the Soviets.\nHow do you get supplies\nto the mujahideen?\nYou have to route\nthem through Pakistan.\nThat's when the relationship\nbetween Pakistan and the United\nStates flourished because\nwe really had no option.\nHistory doesn't repeat\nitself, but it rhymes.\nWe did the exact same\nthing in the 2000s.\nAnd when we were at\nwar in Afghanistan,\nwe needed the ground lines of\ncommunication through Pakistan.\nAnd the relationship between the\nISI and the CIA in the 1980s,\nbecause of the US\nrole in Afghanistan,\nbecame-- what's the right\nword for it-- blossomed.\nBut there was always tension\nin that relationship.\nBut due to US nonproliferation\nlegislation in Congress,\nthe United States would\nhave been obligated\nto sanction Pakistan\nand cut off all aid\nif Pakistan were to\nassemble a nuclear weapon.\nRemember, Pakistan\nand India never\nsigned the Nuclear\nNonproliferation Treaty.\nUS legislation required\nthat a state that was not\na member of the\nNon-Proliferation Treaty\nfound with nuclear weapons--\nor who had nuclear weapons,\nwould face immediate\nsanctions cut off of US aid.\nBut that threatened US\noperations in Afghanistan,\nso that couldn't happen.\nSo there was a lot of tension\nbetween the nonproliferation\nhawks at the state\ndepartment and the executive.\nSo the Reagan administration\nwent to great lengths\nto play fast and loose\non where Pakistan\nwas with its nuclear program.\nEverybody knew that Pakistan\nhad a nuclear weapons program.\nBut the wording of the\nlanguage of the legislation\nrequired-- and it\nlater embodied in what\nwas known as the\nSolarz Amendment\nthat the US presence\ncertify that Pakistan\ndoesn't have nuclear weapons.\nSo as long as the\nexecutive-- and the executive\ndefined nuclear weapons as the\nassembly of a nuclear weapon.\nSo as long as Pakistan\ndid not cross that line,\nthe executive could\ncertify that Pakistan\nwas a non-nuclear weapon state.\nAnd therefore, the aid and the\nrelationship between the US\nand Pakistan could continue.\nAUDIENCE: When you say\nPakistan, is this so east\nand west are actually\nseparate countries?\nVIPIN NARANG: So\nBangladesh, at this point,\nis an independent country after\n1970-- so this is west-- this\nis Pakistan, Pakistan,\npresent day Pakistan.\nAnd this is with Zia.\nZia is the president general."], "2830": [14, 250, "And he's the present of\nPakistan during the 1980s.\nAnd we'll get through\nthe-- there's a slow march\nto nuclearization\nSo '83, there's\nsome Chinese assistance to\nthe Pakistani nuclear program.\nIn fact, on precedent, I think,\nin the annals of proliferation,\nChina transferred--\nis now, I think, out\nin declassified documents,\nthe United States believes,\nand i think Pakistan has\nadmitted, that they received 50\nkilograms of HEU from Pakistan.\nThat's effectively two\nbombs worth of HEU.\nAssuming 25 kilograms\na per bomb--\ntwo bombs worth of HEU\nfrom China plus the design\nfor uranium core warhead,\nknown as CHIC-4 design.\nIt was the fourth test in\nthe Chinese test series.\nSo that's 1983.\nBy 1986, the US is\nessentially convinced\nthat Pakistan is a\nnuclear capable state.\nBut remember, it\nhad it certified\nas a non-nuclear weapons state.\nSo they were two\nscrewdriver turns away,\nyou could certify them as a\nnon-nuclear weapons state.\nAnd the executive\ncontinued to do that.\nIn March 1987, Zia\ncomplicates all\nof this when he claims that\nPakistan has the capability\nto make a bomb in Time magazine.\nSo all of the nonproliferation\nhawks go nuts.\nHere, you have the\npresident of Pakistan\nsaying to Time magazine that\nPakistan-- he literally said,\nyou could write Pakistan has\nthe capability to make a bomb,\nand they did.\nAnd it was then that\ncongressman Stephen Solarz\npassed the Solarz\namendment where\nthe president had to\nactually certify Pakistan\nnot a nuclear weapon state.\nBut the language he\nput in there made\nit easier for the president\nto be able to say that and not\nbe lying because the language\nis basically nuclear device.\nSo if the device\nwasn't assembled,\nthe executive could legitimately\nclaim that Pakistan did not\nhave a nuclear weapon.\nEven though it had\nthe pit over there,\nthe explosive package over\nhere, the assembly over here,\nbut it would all be on\nthree sides of the room.\nBut you could certify\nthat it wasn't assembled,\nso it wasn't a nuclear weapon.\nAnd so by 1988, the\nnonproliferation hawks\nhad given up, and Solarz\nquipped that it had a Saturday\nnight special capability.\nIt may not be elegant,\nbut it'll do the job.\nAnd one of the advantages to\nthe Pakistani nuclear weapons\nprogram was, given\nthe fact that they\nhad a tested design\nfrom the Chinese,\nthey conducted a series of\ncold tests in the 1980s.\nBut they didn't have to\nnecessarily conduct a hot test\nto know that their\nweapons would work,\nunlike the Indians who\nwere indigenously designing\ntheir plutonium devices.\nSo by the late 1980s, Pakistan\nis a nuclear weapons capable\nstate.\nIn fact, the War in Afghanistan\nends around 1989, 1990.\nPresident George H\nW Bush is president.\nAnd as soon as the US stops--\nas soon as the Cold War\ncollapse-- sorry-- the\nSoviet Union collapses,\nPresident H W Bush\nrefuse to certify\nPakistan as a non-nuclear\nweapon states anymore.\nAUDIENCE: You talk\na out cold test.\nWhat constitutes a cold test?\nVIPIN NARANG: A cold test is\nwithout the fissile material.\nSo you--\nAUDIENCE: Do they really\nknow that it works?\nVIPIN NARANG:\nEspecially in this case,\nit's a spherical compression.\nSo they wanted to, as they were\ntesting the explosive charges,\nmake sure they get a\nuniform compression wave.\nBecause they weren't using--\nit's a uranium device,\nbut they weren't\ndesigning contact devices.\nIt was still an implosion.\nIt was a uranium\nimplosion device.\nAnd so you could do a cold test\nwithout the fissile material\nto make sure that you had\na uniform compression.\nSo you can do a\nsufficient number of tests\nwithout the fissile material.\nAnd since the design itself\nwas tested in a hot test,\nI think the Pakistanis\nwere quite confident\nthat once they had enough\nfissile material in the design,\nit would work."], "3080": [15, 80, "So in this period, remember,\nIndia is in dormancy.\nBut there's a-- in response to\nZia's claim in Time magazine\nand several other statements,\nIndia brings its program out\nof dormancy in\nresponse, actually,\nto Pakistan's program.\nSo there's a narrative--\nthe conventional wisdom\nis that India's\nnuclear program beget\nPakistan's nuclear program.\nBut it's the other way around.\nSo Pakistan's\nprogram is triggered\nby Indian conventional power.\nIndia has this rudimentary\nnuclear hedging program\nin the 1970s.\nIt was only when\nPakistan claimed publicly\nthat it had a nuclear weapons\ncapability that India brings\nits program out of dormancy.\nSo it was only in 1988, 1989--\nit was actually winter of 1989.\nThen Prime Minister\nRajiv Gandhi orders\nwork on weaponization,\nminiaturization, production\nline, all the things you need\nto have a military program.\nAnd India only is starting\nthen, at that point, racing\nto develop delivery capability.\nSo they had indigenous\nmissiles, the Agni\nand the Prithvi missile.\nAnd so India was playing\nfrom behind in this period.\nSo

they have long range\nballistic missiles.\nThey had some\naircraft capability,\nbut they're primarily moving\na missile capability now.\nAnd they have very\nrecessed posture,\nvery few weapons on

better.\nSo if you want battlefield\nnuclear weapons or higher yield\nstrategic weapons, and you\nhave payload constraints--\nyou're trading off\nrange for payload,\nso a plutonium gets you much\nbetter yield-to-weight ratios.\nSo it is about 4 to 1 advantage.\nAnd once they had\nthe uranium devices,\nthey're worried--\nPakistan was always\nworried that India would\nattack its nuclear

this has evolved in\nthe past 15, 16 years.\nFirst of all, it's\ncredible because all\nof Pakistan's nuclear weapons\nare under military custody.\nUnlike India where the\ncivilian custody and control\nof nuclear weapons, Pakistan\nis a de facto praetorian state.\nThe Army is a dominant\ndecision making body.\nAnd so all the nuclear weapons\nprogram, from cradle to grave,\nis under army management.\nSo they control the\nnuclear weapons program.\nThere's been a shift to\nbattlefield nuclear weapons.\nThere's a capability\nknown as the NASR missile.\nIf anyone's been following\nthis, it's a 60 kilometer,\nshort range nuclear\nweapon system\nthat will be fielded at the\nrear edge of battle that\nwould target Indian\nforces if they\ncross the international border.\nThey have a series of cruise\nmissiles, which are also\ndesigned to be battlefield\nnuclear weapons, the Ra'ad\nand the Babur.\nAnd they have an explicitly\ndeterrence by denial mission.\nThey're trying to deter\nIndian conventional attacks\nacross the international border."], "3540": [20, 180, "So there are some--\nany questions\nabout where we are in terms of\nhow India and Pakistan think\nabout nuclear weapons\nin their force postures?\nYeah?\nAUDIENCE: Around that time\nwas India suggesting at all\nthat that they were\ninterested in traditional war\nwith Pakistan?\nVIPIN NARANG: So this is\nan excellent question.\nWhy would Pakistan-- I'll\nskip through some of this\nbecause the crux of the\nproblem now is India\ndoesn't have any territorial\ndesigns on Pakistan.\nWhy would India want to\ndismember Pakistani further?\nIt prefers a stable Pakistan.\nIt has no territorial\nambitions in Pakistan.\nThere are some-- Kashmir\nis a disputed-- there's\na dispute over Kashmir.\nBut frankly, the line\nof control on both sides\nis effectively the\nde facto border.\nThere won't be much territorial\nrevision over Kashmir.\nAnd certainly, if you're worried\nabout a conventional attack\nacross the international\nborder, how do you get there?\nI'll get to that in one second\nafter very quickly talking\nabout, in the\nnuclear sense, what\nthe difference is between\nSouth Asian the Cold War.\nSo both sides now\nhave nuclear weapons.\nSome of the key differences\nbetween India, Pakistan,\nand the United States\nand the Soviet Union\nare, one, rudimentary\ncapabilities still,\norganizational\ncommand and control\nis not as mature in either\ncountry as in the Cold\nWar, especially in the later\nyears the Cold War obviously.\nBut the other big difference\nis they border each other.\nSo the flight times\nbetween India and Pakistan\nis on the order of\na couple minutes.\nThe US and Soviet\nUnion was 30 minutes.\nSo you had a half hour to\nfigure what was going on.\nIn India and Pakistan,\nyou have two minutes--\nif you had any early warning--\nand early warning systems are\nvery rudimentary-- if you\nhad any early warning,\nor indication that the\nother side is launching\na potential nuclear strike,\nyou have two minutes\nbefore that thing\nis going to hit.\nSo your reaction times\nhave to be much quicker.\nThe other big difference\nis-- I'm going\nto skip through this here.\nThe other big difference\nis, as you mentioned,\nwhy would India be interested\nin conventional attacks\nagainst Pakistan?\nWell, it wouldn't be\nab-- it wouldn't be\nthe first to initiate conflict.\nThe Indian problem\nright now is it\nis facing a Pakistan that is\nmore aggressively emboldened\nto launch militant attacks\nin India using organization--\nproxy organization\nsponsored by the state--\nor believed to be\nsponsored by the state,\nlike Lushkar-e-Taiba,\nJaish-e-Mohammed.\nAnd the strategy has\nchanged since Pakistan\ntested nuclear weapons.\nPrior to 1998, Pakistan--\nthere was a strategy,\ncoined by Zia and\nGeneral Aslam Baig,\nknown as bleeding\nIndia by 1,000 cuts.\nSo there's a strategy of\ncutting India at the periphery.\nIn the line of control in\nJammu Kashmir in the mountains,\nyou couldn't have a real\nconventional battle,\nbut you could have\nterrorist infiltration.\nThere would be some attacks\nand just small cuts."], "3720": [21, 70, "The frequency of\nover infiltration\nby regular forces in\nthe Kargil War in 1999\nand then multiple attacks on\nIndian metropolitan cities\nwith these Pakistan-based\nmilitant organizations.\nIt leads to a\ncondition where India\nwouldn't be starting a war,\nbut it would be retaliating.\nSo India's mainstay threat\nprior to nuclearization\nwas if you try the strategy of\nbleeding us by a thousand cuts,\nwe're going to punish\nyou where it hurts.\nWe're going to\ndestroy your army.\nIf you're an army led state,\nan army controlled state,\nwe'll cross the\ninternational border,\nand we will attrit your army.\nAnd that will punish Pakistan.\nSo that was the deterrence\nby punishment strategy\nIndia had at the conventional\nlevel prior to nuclearization.\nBut post-nuclearization\nnow Pakistan is doing what?\nIt threatens-- well, it's going\nto stand and fight for a while.\nBut in extreme, it threatens\ntactical nuclear use\non Indian forces if\nIndia tries to retaliate\nacross the international border.\nAnd so that's the scenario\nthat India finds itself now.\nAnd that's the\nscenario in which India\nwould think about conventional\nconflict with Pakistan.\nIt's not for\nterritorial ambition\nor any territorial gains."], "3790": [22, 10, "So there are a couple examples.\nThe first is the Kargil War.\nDoes anyone

forces.\nPreviously, this exact operation\nhad been attempted in 1965.\nIndia launched air strikes\nacross the line of control\nand opened a second front\nacross the international border.\nThis, time the BJP\nresponded very differently.\nBecause of Pakistan's\nnuclearization,\nthe BJP was much more restrained\nand sustained heavier losses\nbecause the threat of\nescalating the conflict\ndeterred the BJP from\nthe same kind of response\nthat it had in 1965--\nthat India had.\nSo it refused to\nallow air operations\nacross the line of control.\nSo Indian aircraft could not\ncross the line of control\nin hot pursuit of\nPakistsani infiltrators.\nAnd most importantly,\nthey did not\nthreaten to open up\nthe second front.\nThe place where India's\nconventional advantage really\ncomes to bear is on the\ninternational border, here.\nSo most of the\nfighting was here.\nThis was where the\ninfiltration was.\nBut India has a huge advantage\nin this plane sector, which\nis the international border.\nSo any time there has been\na previous provocation,\nIndia has always mobilized\nforces here and threatened\nto open up a second\nfront where it can really\nbring its conventional\npower to bear on Pakistan.\nThis time, the BJP\nrefused to threaten\nto open-- it did\nnot mobilize any\nof its mainstay\nconventional forces\non the international\nborder and didn't threaten\nto open up a second front.\nAnd so it took Indian\nforces a lot longer,\nand they sustained much heavier\nlosses in the Kargil War,\nbecause they had to expel\nPakistani forces symmetrically.\nSo they didn't have the\nvirtue of air power hitting\nbehind Pakistani lines.\nAnd there wasn't any ability to\ntake pressure off of this front\nby opening up a second front\nin the international border.\nSo already you can see\nIndia's response is restrained"], "3960": [24, 110, "So shortly after September\n11 here, two months later--\nthree months later,\nthere was an attack\non the Indian parliament.\nSo you had about half\na dozen gunman break\nthrough the barriers of the\nIndian Parliament house.\nI mean imagine an\nattack on Congress here.\nIt would be the equivalent.\nSo you had Jaish-e-Mohammed and\nLushkar-e-Taiba joint attack\non the Indian\nparliament in Delhi.\nNever heard of before that\nthey-- these militant groups,\nwhich are nominally supported\nby the Pakistani state,\nwould attack the Indian capital.\nSo you had this\nattack in December.\nThe BJP is furious.\nImagine what the\nUnited States would\ndo if a militant organization\nattacked the US Congress.\nSo you can imagine the\noutrage in India at the time.\nSo the BJP contemplates\nlimited war here\nacross the line of control,\nso destroying terrorist camps\nacross the line of control.\nUnder a lot of pressure\nfrom the US government\nbecause remember\nwhat's happened?\nWe were mobilizing for war\non Afghanistan at this point.\nWe need Pakistan.\nThe United States\nneeds General Musharraf\nto not be distracted by a\nconventional war with India.\nCan you imagine how that\nwould have affected the US\nwar in Afghanistan if\nIndia and Pakistan got\ninto a conventional\nwar at the time.\nSo a lot of pressure on\nboth sides to not go to war.\nSo Deputy Secretary of State\nat the time, Dick Armitage,\ngets on the phone.\nHe's on the phone, he said,\ntwice a day with the BJP\nurging them to show restraint.\nAnd India backs off\nactually for a while.\nBut then there's\na secondary attack\nin a small town called\nKaluchack in Jammu,\nwhich is an army town.\nAnd the Jaish militants killed\n36 Indian army families.\nAnd so the BJP, at\nthis point-- this"], "4070": [25, 110, "And so the BJP says\nenough is enough.\nSo they mobilize India's three--\nthey call them the three Strike\nCorps.\nThese are the main offensive\ncomponents of the Indian army.\n800,000 forces in total.\nAnd they're mobilized in\ntheir assembly boxes, which\nare much larger than shown\nhere, 60 kilometer breadth,\nin these three positions,\npoised for attacks\nacross the international border.\nSo this is where\nthe threat of war\nbecomes real for South Asia.\nSO the BJP, you don't mobilize\nthese forces just as a bluff.\nAnd so there's a real\nconcern that the BJP\nwould authorize attacks.\nAnd at this point,\nPakistan engages\nin some serious nuclear signal.\nThey test three nuclear\ncapable missiles,\nwithout the warheads of course.\nPresident Musharraf makes\nvery explicit nuclear threats\nto the Indians that if they\ncross the international border\nthat Pakistan may have no option\nbut to use nuclear weapons.\nThe US and the United\nKingdom evacuate\ntheir nonessential\npersonnel from India.\nI mean it was very\nserious at this point.\nAfter these nuclear\nthreats, and again,\na lot of pressure from the\nUnited States on India,\nPrime Minister Vajpayee\norders, several months later,\nthe Strike Corps back to their\npeacetime cantonments, which\nare in the interior of India.\nAnd later on, he\nsaid, look, I don't\nthink that a risk of\nnuclear war was high,\nbut I didn't want to be\nresponsible for starting one.\nAnd so there was a\nreal palpable threat\nthat if India engaged in this\nkind of conventional operation\nagainst Pakistan and\ndefeated the Pakistan army,\nthat there's a real risk that\nnuclear weapons would be used.\nThe third instance was\nthe Bombay attack in 2008"], "4180": [26, 120, "So here, this was even more\naudacious, in some ways,\nthan the parliament attack.\nThis wasn't a ragtag group\nof six guys in a car.\nThis was a dozen well-trained,\nheavily armed militants coming\nby sea from Karachi,\nquarterbacked-- it now turns\nout-- by retired ISI handlers.\nThe United States picked\nup signals intelligence\nand intercepts between\nhandlers in Pakistan\nwho were former ISI officers\nquarterbacking the operation\nas they attacked Bombay.\nAnd it killed 170 civilians.\nSo the media tends to downplay\nthe number of Westerners that\nwere deliberately\ntargeted by the militant--\nby the LeT militants.\nAnd India was justifiably\noutraged at this attack.\nBut the government\nwas again paralyzed.\nSo this time it's the\nCongress government\nnot the BJP government\nthat's making decisions.\nAnd it doesn't mobilize\nforces this time.\nThe prime minister,\nMahmud Hussein,\nsaid he did not want a\nrepeat of 2001, 2002.\nWe don't want to mobilize\nforces and not do anything.\nSo what do we do?\nAnd here we have the paralysis\nthat the Indian policy\ncommunity faces is any serious\nconventional retaliation risks\nnuclear escalation.\nI think this is where\nIndia finds itself.\nAnd this is from\na cabinet meeting.\nSo this is a report\nfrom the cabinet meeting\nwhere the prime\nminister and the defense\nminister, foreign minister,\nfinance minister, home minister\nare meeting.\nAnd the conclusion was,\nwhen the dust settled,\nall the principles agreed\nthat the unpredictability\non the Pakistan side and the\nfear that its decision-makers\ncould offer a disproportionate\nresponse, including\nthe nuclear option,\nstymied any possible chance\nof military action on India'a\nbehalf after-- 26/11 is their--\nis what they call\nthe Bombay attacks."], "4300": [27, 460, "So there's real\nparalysis now about how\ndo you deter-- see\nnuclear weapons can't\ndeter militant attacks\nagainst the Indian state.\nBut you lost your\nconventional option\nto punish Pakistan,\nwhich was how you tried\nto deter it in the first place.\nAnd Pakistan has\nsuccessfully deterred\nIndian a conventional power by\nlowering the nuclear threshold,\ntaking a play right out\nof the NATO playbook,\nthreatening early nuclear use if\nIndian forces threaten to cross\nthe international border.\nSo now, after\nnuclearization 1998,\nwhat we have is more\nfrequent and intense\ncrises triggered by Pakistan.\nThere's a belief that\nthey're emboldened\nby the shield of\nearly nuclear use,\nknowing that India can't really\nretaliate with ground power.\nWe can get into-- we have\nsome time for questions.\nWe can get into why India hasn't\ntried to develop an air strike\noption.\nThat gets into the politics\nof the Indian military--\nthe service rivalries\nthat India has.\nThe Air Force has always\nrefused to think about options\nthat don't involve\nthe army mobilizing\nbecause the belief is that\nPakistan would retaliate\non the ground.\nAnd so the Air Force doesn't\nbelieve that standalone air\noptions are possible without a\nground option being mobilized.\nAUDIENCE: So what\nis Pakistan trying\nto achieve with these attacks?\nVIPIN NARANG: So this is an\ninteresting strategic question.\nWhat does Pakistan hope--\nso if your Pakistan,\nyou're facing a\nconventional-- you're\nfacing massive conventional\ninferiority, which is only\ngrowing because the size\nand growth rates of the two\ncountries are so\ndisproportionate that India's\ngap is just going-- it's\ngoing to be a yawning\ngap at this point.\nSo going forward, how\ndo you slow India down?\nSo there's one theory\nout there, which\nis these periodic attacks on\nIndia's financial and political\nhubs create these\nperiodic crises to get\nforeign investors skittish.\nSo you get periodic slowdowns\nbeing triggered by this,\nand you can slow down\nIndia's economic growth\npotential if you make it\nrisky to invest in India.\nSo that's one theory out there.\nThe other theory is Pakistan\nhas always had crazies\nthat is trained to attack.\nGood crazies kill Indians.\nBad crazies kill Pakistanis.\nAnd so they need-- there's\na safety valve theory.\nAnd they've always\nhad a safety valve.\nBefore it was Kashmir.\nNow, Kashmir is locked\ndown because Indian army\nknows how to prevent\ninfiltration at Kashmir.\nFor a while, it was Afghanistan.\nUS military has to be asked,\nwhy are these guys speaking\nPunjabi in Afghanistan?\nBecause these are the Punjabi\ntrained militants, the LeT,\nthat have gone now to\nAfghanistan to fight,\nand they're killing Americans.\nAnd now if you can turn them\nagainst the Indian state,\ngreat.\nAs long as they're not\nkilling Pakistanis,\nthey are good militants.\nAnd so there's one\ntheory out there\nthat the Pakistan state still\nviews these militant groups\nas strategic assets\nof the states\nto perpetually attack and\nbleed India by 1,000 cuts.\nAnd if you can't get\nin through Kashmir,\nif you could infiltrate\nby sea to Bombay, great.\nIf you can hit Delhi, great.\nBefore nuclear weapons,\nhitting Bombay or Delhi\nreally risked serious\nconventional retaliation.\nBut now that you\nhave nuclear weapons\nand operational\nnuclear capability\nand tactical nuclear\nweapons to deter\nthat conventional\nretaliation, those kinds\nof audacious attacks\nare more possible.\nAnd so these are the two\nkind of theories out there,\nand they're not\nmutually exclusive.\nAUDIENCE: What [INAUDIBLE]\nin Afghanistan.\nWhat are they called\nthe thieves, the rebels,\nor whatever-- they were fighting\n[INAUDIBLE] in Afghanistan?\nVIPIN NARANG: I mean I think\nthat there are people here\nwho can say more\nabout this who had\nfirsthand experience with this.\nBut there are a lot of reports\nthat you had Punjabi speaking.\nI mean most of the Afghan\nmujahideen are Pashto speaking.\nThere's a Haqqani network.\nA lot of these\nnetworks predate 9/11.\nAnd they were supported,\nfunded, and there\nare strong relationships\nbetween the ISI\nand some of the mujahideen\ngroups in Afghanistan that\nended up being the Taliban--\nremember the only two\nstates that recognized\nthe Taliban were\nPakistan, Saudi Arabia.\nSo the networks that\nPakistan had in Afghanistan\nwere very strong.\nAnd they had these\nother groups also,\nso if they needed militants\nto go help fight what ended up\nbeing the Americans as\nwell as Karzai's ANA,\nit would be the LeT and\nthe Jaish-e-Mohammeds.\nSo there were reports of\nPunjabi speaking militants,\nwell-trained Punjabi\nspeaking militants,\nfighting in Afghanistan\nalongside Pashto\nspeaking Haqqani\nnetwork militants.\nSo that was a safety\nvalve for a while.\nAnd now, I think\nthis is why Pakistan\nmay have an\nincentive for a fight\nto continue in\nAfghanistan for a while\nso it has someplace\nto send its crazies.\nIt's a safety valve for a while.\nAnd they're worried about\nIndian influence in Afghanistan\nso that there would\nbe-- those militants\nwould be boxed into Pakistan.\nOn the one hand,\nPakistan faces--\nthere was this awful\nschool attack recently.\nThere's a real terrorist\nproblem in Pakistan also.\nSo bad militants\nkill Pakistanis.\nGood militants kill\nIndians and Americans.\nSteph?\nAUDIENCE: I was going\nto ask that question as\nto whether [INAUDIBLE]\nare all bad.\nBut initially, that\ncomes out maybe\nto supporting the\nmilitants out there.\nDo you think that that is--\nthat initial rhetoric is\ngoing to stick?\nOr do you think they\nwill then go back\nto what they've\nalways done which\nis we're going to support\nwhoever destablizes people\nwe don't like?\nVIPIN NARANG: So I think the\nevidence suggests the latter.\nI mean it is remarkable that\nthe LeT-- so after 2001, 2000,\nthe LeT was nominally banned.\nBut they just renamed\nthemselves to Jamaat-ud-Dawa.\nAnd Hafiz Saeed who is\nthe head of the LeT lives\nopenly, not out in\nthe tribal areas.\nHe lives outside Lahore\nin a town called Muridke.\nEverybody knows where they are.\nThey're openly fund-raising.\nHe goes on TV calling for\nthe death of Indians openly.\nAnd the fact that he--\nit's an open question\nwhether it's active\nsupport or passive support.\nBut at least the evidence\nsuggest-- the evidence suggests\nat least passive support.\nHe is allowed to freely operate.\nHe is allowed to\nfreely raise funds.\nThe organization exists.\nIt could be shut\ndown very easily.\nIt's in the heart of Pakistan.\nIt's like 30 kilometers\nfrom the Indian border.\nThe Indians could hit it.\nBut they have refrained\nfrom doing so.\nBut the network is allowed to\nrecruit and operate openly.\nAnd we're not talking about like\nthe Northwest Front, the Khyber\nPakhtunkhwa, the tribal areas.\nThis is the heartland\nof Pakistan.\nAnd so it offends credibility\nto think that it's not--\nthere isn't some state policy to\nallow certain groups to operate\nto some extent while thinking\nyou could target the rest.\nBut there's also that suggests\nthese guys were different hats\non different days.\nBut the sectarian groups, I\nthink, are allowed to operate.\nThose are the ones that--\nthe other good militants seem\nto be those that kill Shia.\nAs long as they don't\nkill Sunni, it's fine.\nSo some of those groups\nhave been very, very fierce\nand are allowed\nto operate still.\nIn the Haqqani\nnetwork and the LeT,\nas long as they're not\nkilling Sunnis in Punjab,\nit seems like the\nPakistani state\nis willing to tolerate\ntheir existence."], "4760": [28, 980, "And this is different\nfrom the Cold War.\nWe didn't have-- I don't\nthink the United States\nand the Soviet Union had to deal\nwith that kind of proxy level\nmilitancy where you have\ntwo strategic assets.\nYou have the militant\norganizations\nto try and weaken the other\nstate plus nuclear weapons\nto deter the retaliation.\nSo that combination\nis, I think, what\nmakes it particularly dangerous,\nwhich is what I conclude here.\nSo you have-- India is\nextremely frustrated.\nAnd I think the worry\nin the United States\nis that if there's another\nmass casualty terrorist\nattack in India, how\nwill the BJP-- now\nyou have a new prime minister\nwho is, by all accounts,\na little more aggressive than\nhis predecessors, a little more\nhawkish.\nAnd right now, the\nstability in South Asia\nis predicated on Indian\nrestraint following\none of these mass casualty\nterrorist attacks.\nSo if there's another Bombay,\nhow will the BJP respond?\nWe can talk-- if anybody\nhas heard of Cold Start,\nwe talk about that.\nYou guys can all email\nme if anyone ever wants\nto get into some of the weeds.\nBut the basic idea is India\nhas conventional superiority.\nIt has not used it yet.\nThere's some belief that\nPakistan's nuclear threat is\na bluff and that\nIndia could execute\ncertain conventional objectives\nbelow the nuclear threshold.\nMaybe, maybe not.\nIt's pretty risky.\nParticularly, we talk about\ntactical nuclear weapons\nthat would, at\nleast at some point,\nbe devolved to the\nbrigadier level maybe.\nAnd so you'll have-- it's not\njust one nuclear threshold,\nbut nine.\nAnd so you have\nto worry about one\nof them deciding\nthat this is the end,\nand they use nuclear weapons.\nI think the Pakistani strategy\nis actually quite rational.\nIt's deterring with\nthe rational threatened\nthat we might use\ntactical nuclear weapons,\nbut also through a\nmadman mechanism.\nWe're going to develop\nnuclear weapons,\nand hey, one of our brigadiers\nmight use them if you come.\nAnd that reinforces the rational\ndeterrent threat as well.\nAnd so, so far, both\nin Kargil-- sorry.\nIn three instances, Kargil,\nParakram, and Bombay,\nIndia has relatively restrained\nits conventional retaliation\nand its response.\nAnd so far, that has\ntaken India and Pakistan\noff the escalatory highway.\nBut it's no guarantee that\nthat'll continue going forward.\nI think the emotions in India\nare running very high vis-a-vis\nPakistan.\nParticularly, there's\nincreased shelling\nacross the line of control\nin the past several months.\nAnd if there's a significant\nattack in a major city that\ninvolves the death of\nmany Indian civilians,\nthere'll be a lot of pressure\non Prime Minister Modi\nto do something about it.\nAnd then all bets are\noff because you'll\nhave nuclear weapons\npotentially mixed\nwith conventional\nconflict, and that\nwould be the escalation ladder.\nI think that's\nsomething that we're\nlikely-- it's this element of\nterrorist attack mass casualty\nterrorist attacks that didn't\nexist in the Cold War, that\nmakes South Asia quite\ndifferent, I think,\nfrom the US and Soviet balance.\nAnd so it's that\ncombination of proxy forces\nand the arms race that, I think,\nmakes it particularly unstable.\nSo I'm going to stop there.\nWe are almost out\nof time, but I'm\nhappy to take\nquestions for a while\nif anybody has any further\nthoughts or anything.\nYeah?\nAUDIENCE: Does Pakistan\nhave strategic weapons aimed\nat Indian cities or--\nVIPIN NARANG: It does.\nYeah.\nAUDIENCE: --weapon\nalso reach [INAUDIBLE].\nVIPIN NARANG: Yeah.\nSo this gets into a concept\nknown as escalation dominance.\nPakistan also has\nstrategic weapons\nthat put most of India's\nmatrices in reach.\nThe idea being that that\ndeters Indian retaliation\nfor tactical\nnuclear-- so Pakistan\nviews tactical nuclear\nuse as a war terminating\nstrategy because of\nthe strategic weapons.\nSo the idea is if any\nconventional forces\nattack, Pakistan stands\nand fights conventionally.\nFine.\nThey start losing.\nThey use tactical nuclear\nweapons on Indian forces.\nBut now I have a secure\nsecond strike capability\nalso if I'm Pakistan.\nSo India has no incentive to use\nits strategic nuclear weapons\nagainst Pakistani cities because\nnuclear use on your forces\noperating on Pakistani soil,\nthat's already happened.\nAm I willing to risk Delhi\nand Bombay for retaliating.\nProbably not.\nNow absent the strategic\ncapabilities, you're right.\nThen, India could\neasily retaliate,\nand there would be no\nreciprocation from Pakistan.\nBut Pakistan is\ntrying to establish\nwhat it calls escalation\ndominance so that it could\nuse tactical nuclear\nweapons, and that\nwould be the end of it.\nSo India would have no\nincentive to retaliate\nwith strategic nuclear\nweapons against Pakistan.\nThere is some belief\nthat India's looking\nat lower order use options.\nIndia has no tactical\nnuclear weapons itself.\nBut there are some\ncapabilities that\ncould be used for softer\ntargets than just cities.\nAnd it may be that\nIndia tries to develop\ntit-for-tat capabilities.\nAnd then that's basically your\nescalation ladder as well.\nIn the back?\nAUDIENCE: So if\nIndia is so paralyzed\nand Pakistan realizes\nthis, why hasn't Pakistan\nincrease the\nfrequency of attack?\nVIPIN NARANG: I think part of\nit is you can't do it too often.\nYou do it too often, and\nthen the core world opinion--\nI think there's a limit to\nhow often you can do it.\nBut once every two, three\nyears is not nothing.\nAnd there's always chatter.\nThere have been several\ninstances where the Indian home\nministry claims-- now, I don't\nknow how good the evidence is--\nthat they've disrupted several\nattacks by LeT on Indians--\non India.\nBut every several years, I\nthink that's not nothing.\nAnd they also choose relatively\nstrategic moments to do it.\nSo if you look at the timing of\nthe attack on the parliament,\ntwo months after 9/11, just as\nthe Pakistani US relationship\nis growing again.\nMaybe there's a belief\nyou can get away\nwith it because the US\nis going to protect you.\nThe Bombay attack was just\nas then President Musharraf\nwas-- there was discussion\nof concluding a back channel\nfinal agreement over Kashmir.\nAnd the LeT and the\nIndia-focused militants\nacted as veto\nplayers, as spoilers.\nAnd so there was\na comp-- something\nknown as the composite\ndialogue ongoing between India\nand Pakistan in 2008 where\nliterally everybody knew\nwhat the final solution peace\ndeal between India and Pakistan\nwould like.\nAnd President Musharraf\nwas very serious about it.\nThis was spoilers within\nPakistan vetoing that deal\nand disrupting the dialogue.\nSo India had no option\nbut to terminate\nthe composite\ndialogue after Bombay.\nAnd it hasn't really restarted.\nAnd so those strategic\nmoments, I think,\nare chosen by Pakistani\nmilitants to attack India.\nYes, sir?\nSo what's the story-- I've heard\nbits and pieces about Khan.\nHow did he evolve?\nWhere did he come from?\nWhat was--\nVIPIN NARANG: Yes, so that's\na whole other-- AQ Khan,\nhe stole the designs.\nHe provided the uranium\nenrichment capability\nto Pakistan.\nHe orchestrated a network\nof global suppliers\nfor the components\nfor the centrifuges,\nwhich he then leveraged\nfor both state policy.\nSo he used that network\nto get North Korea\nits centrifuge capability.\nBut whether, with complicit\nstate support or acting\non his own, he also\ndecided to make\nsome money by moonlighting,\nmaybe, with Iran and Libya.\nAnd there's believed to\nbe a fourth customer.\nDon't know who that is.\nBut there's a big debate also in\nthe Pakistan nuclear community\nabout how influential\nAQ Khan really was.\nI mean they're moving to the\nplutonium designs anyway.\nPAEC, which is the Pakistan\nAtomic Energy Commission.\nThey're responsible for\nplutonium production pathway.\nThey're competing for\ndesigns and for ownership\nof the Pakistani program.\nSo in Pakistan, he\nstill-- he claims\nto be the father of\nthe Pakistani bomb.\nThat's up for dispute.\nBut some of the\nproliferation activities, it\nis unclear whether they\nwere state sponsored\nor whether there was\nsome state complicity,\nand he just acted on his own\nor whether he acted completely\non his own.\nAUDIENCE: But he served this\nthing, I mean is it true?\nI mean did he have this\nbusiness that basically\nsells nuclear technology to\nanyone who will pay the money?\nVIPIN NARANG: I\nmean, like I said-- I\nmean he-- there was a catalog.\nYou could get a\nbrochure for-- yeah.\nAnd so it is true\nthat there was--\nhe definitely had really\nsignificant dealings\nwith Iran, which is interesting\nbecause Iran and Pakistan\naren't natural allies--\nare the ones who made Shia,\nSunni-- they're not natural.\nIran has also been involved\nwith the Balochistan insurgency\nin Pakistan.\nSo that he would sell\ncentrifuges to Iran\nseems a little puzzling.\nMay be it was for-- seems\nlike personal gain would\nbe a very strong explanation.\nThere's some evidence\nthat he approached Iraq\nin the late 1980s to see if\nthey're interested in uranium\nenrichment.\nSaddam Hussein thought it was\na trap, so he passed on it.\nBut, yeah, I mean\nthere's no question\nthat there was-- this is a\nbig nonproliferation failure.\nAUDIENCE: I can't\nremember if I read\nabout it on [INAUDIBLE]\nmedia or [INAUDIBLE],\nbut I remember\nreading about this.\nAnd what they said was that he\nwas doing it for personal gain.\nVIPIN NARANG: Yeah, there's no\nquestion he made a lot of money\nfrom it.\nBut you would have to\nleverage some assets\nfrom Pakistan military\nto do some of this stuff.\nThere's no way that they\ndidn't-- some people\ndidn't know about unless\nthey were in on the take,\nwhich is entirely possible.\nI mean I find it hard--\ncertainly the North\nKorean deal, I mean they\nflew Pakistani C-17,\nso it was military transport\nthat took the first centrifuge\ncascade over to North Korea.\nSo that was definitely\nstate to state.\nSome of the other\nstuff is just really\nmurky as to the level\nof state complicity.\nWere there people in\nthe Pakistan government\nwho knew he was doing it.\nI'd probably-- it would be hard\nfor me to believe that they\ndidn't.\nBut it may not have\nbeen state policy.\nYes, sir?\nLast question, I\nthink, then we got to--\nSo I think that the\ninfluence of the US support\nis, perhaps, understated.\nIf we ignored Pakistan,\ndidn't like them anymore,\nand the entire international\ncommunity turned on them,\nit might be devastating\nfor them, especially\neconomic sanctions [INAUDIBLE].\nVIPIN NARANG: So we imposed\nsanctions after 1998.\nBut then after September\n11, we needed Pakistan.\nAUDIENCE: How long\nwill we need them?\n[INAUDIBLE]\nVIPIN NARANG: There are a\ncouple good books on this\nout recently.\nI'm not a Pakistan expert.\nAnd this gets into very\nlike-- the empirical evidence\nfor this is-- we don't know.\nBut Pakistan could\nbe very vulnerable.\nI mean I think a nontrivial\nproportion of their revenue\ncomes from US and\ninternational aid.\nBut on the other hand,\ngiven the militancy problem,\nI think most countries\nprefer a stable Pakistan\nto an unstable Pakistan.\nAnd heavy sanctions\ncould really disrupt\nthe fabric of that state.\nAnd say so it's a very\nthin line you walk.\nAnd part of it is, I think the\nopportunity that the United\nStates had was in the 1980s.\nAnd there was a belief in\nthe Reagan administration\nthat it was one or the other.\nIt was either we needed to\nPakistan against the Sovs\nor it's the nuclear program.\nBut we couldn't deal with\nboth at the same time.\nThe United states wasn't happy.\nIt wasn't like the US was happy\nabout the Pakistani nuclear\nprogram.\nBut it is certainly\ntrue that the executive\nwas willing to\nlook the other way\nand tolerate certain\nmovement up to a point,\nprobably on the belief\nthat it was inevitable.\nThere's nothing much\nyou can do about it.\nI'm not sure if that's true.\nI actually think that there were\na lot of leverage points we--\nthe United States could\nhave had in the 1980s\nand didn't take\nadvantage of them.\nBut that's also--\nan administration\nfighting this war may not\nbelieve it has the bandwidth\nto deal with both.\nAnd I think that's\nwhere they ended up.\nBut if there was ever a point,\nit was probably in the 1980s\nto stop Pakistan from\nbecoming a nuclear state\nin the first place.\nBut now that they\nare, it's really hard\nto see what we can do.\nAaron, yeah?\nAUDIENCE: There is an overall\nquestion here, which is tough.\nI mean it's a very\nunstable situation\nbetween India and Pakistan.\nAnd you either keep\ngoing from them\nleading the way it has been\ngoing, or you take a big step.\nAnd the big step\nis either you're\ngoing to do something\nwar-like or peace-like.\nAnd there is a\npeace-like thing which\nnever seems to surface,\nwhich is, look,\nif you can't solve\nthis by war-like steps,\nthen you have to solve\nit by eliminating\nthe political tension.\nAnd that doesn't seem\nto be possible in India.\nIndia is this world power,\nand why don't they stand up--\nwhat's your analysis?\nWhy don't they stand\nup and say, we're\nnot going to solve this\nmilitarily so we better--\nVIPIN NARANG: I think there\nwas a real golden opportunity\nin 2008.\nI think Manmohan Singh and then\nforeign secretary Shivshankar\nMenon who's going to\nbe at MIT actually\nin February at the Center\nfor National Studies with us,\nhe can give more\ninsight on this.\nBut I believe India was\nready to do that in 2008.\nAnd Musharraf was ready\nto do this in 2008.\nCertain elements of the\nPakistani security services\nand their proxy forces\nand the LeT were not.\nAnd so it was just\npolitically untenable,\nafter the Bombay attack, for\nthe Indian political leadership.\nAnd so the spoilers--\nthe spoilers spoiled.\nAUDIENCE: They spoiled\nit, but the point\nis that that was the\npoint to stand up,\nand probably again\nbecause you're in a bind.\nVIPIN NARANG: But I\nmean the politics of it\nwas just too-- I\nmean there's just\nno way that that\ngovernment could\nhave survived if it continued\nwith a composite dialogue.\nAnd it was also a case\nwhere there were facing--\nelections were the next year.\nThere was no way that the\ncomposite dialogue could\nhave continued after bombing.\nNo country could do that.\nNo political leadership could.\nIt's just unfortunate-- the\nunfortunate nature of politics.\nAnd I think the LeT knew that.\nYou perpetrate this\nattack, and you\nwill kill the composite dialogue\nand the back channel talk.\nAnd that's exactly\nwhat happened.\nIt may be-- it's interesting\nbecause sometimes you\nneed a Nixon and\nChina moment, and Modi\nwho is hawkish in the BJP,\nhe has the credibility\nto get the right on his side.\nHe's protect on his right\nflank, which often tends\nto be the spoiler in India.\nSo he has an\nopportunity, I think.\nAnd I wouldn't be surprised if\nthere's some movement toward it\nin the administration provided\nthere are no other attacks.\nSo I think you're right.\nAll the piecess--\neverybody knows\nwhat the final deal looks like.\nThere's one hiccup\nabout whether it's\nsequential or simultaneous\ndemilitarization\nof the Siachen [INAUDIBLE]\nor like minor things.\nI mean those are solvable.\nBut everything else,\nthe line of control\nbecomes a de facto\nnational border.\nEverything else\ngets adjudicated.\nAnd maybe-- Modi has five\nyears, so it's possible.\nIf anyone in India\ncan do it, I think\nit has to be somebody\nfrom the right.\nThe question is whether\nthere's a willing partner--\n[INTERPOSING VOICES]\nVIPIN NARANG: --willing\npartners on Pakistan.\nExactly.\nOK, I think we're over time.\nSo we should-- I gotta pick\nup my kid from daycare,\nso thank you guys.\nThanks!"]}
