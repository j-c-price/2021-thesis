Basics of Deterrence Theory

Basics of Nuclear Weapons

The Nuclearization of South Asia

The Consequences of Nuclearization in South Asia

How Long can this Precarious Balance of Terror Last?
ENDELEMENTDeterrence Theory

* Deterrence: Preservation of the status quo by

threatening unacceptable costs to an opponent if
they do X.

* Two Types of Deterrence
— Deterrence by Punishment

— Deterrence by Denial
ENDELEMENTDeterrence Theory

* Three requirements (aka the Three C’s):
— Capability
— Credibility

— Communication
ENDELEMENTNuclear Weapons & Deterrence

* Nuclear weapons fundamentally different?
— Explosive yields
— Missile age
— Psychological impact

ENDELEMENTBasics of Nuclear Weapons

¢ Fission weapons (5-40kT)
— U-235 (enriched uranium)

— Pu-239 (plutonium from reprocessing)

* Boosted Fission weapons (~200kT)

— Fission weapon plus Tritium/Deuterium gas (or Li-D)

¢ Fusion weapons (Megaton yields)

— Fission primary to ignite a fusion secondary (D-T)
ENDELEMENTOperationalizing Nuclear Weapons:
Nuclear Posture
¢ How many and what type?
¢ How to deliver them?
— Aircraft
— Ballistic Missiles (Land based & Sea-based)

— Cruise Missiles

* How to manage them?
ENDELEMENTOperationalizing Nuclear Weapons:
Nuclear Posture

° Deterring what?
— Deter nuclear use and coercion? Assured Retaliation
* Mostly deterrence by punishment
— Deter conventional aggression? First-use

* Can be deterrence by punishment or denial

ENDELEMENTIndia through 1974

° India’s Security Environment

— Chinese nuclear tests

— Persistent wars with Pakistan, despite conventional
superiority

¢ India’s Civilian Nuclear Program
— CANDU 40 MW reactor 1954
— Reprocessing facility 1964
ENDELEMENTIndia through 1974

° Peaceful Nuclear Explosion 1974
— General security environment
— Domestic political explanation

— Power of scientific bureaucracy

* Nuclear hedging
ENDELEMENTPakistan 1971-1980s

° Pakistan’s Security Environment
— Impact of 1971 War

— “We will eat grass or leaves, or even go hungry. But we will
get [a Bomb] of our own” (Bhutto 1965)

— January 1972, Bhutto authorizes nuclear weapons program

° Pakistan’s Nuclear Program
— Yes we Khan (URENCO)
— Uranium enrichment: The ‘goat shed’ at Kahuta

— US. role in Afghanistan
ENDELEMENTPakistan Late-1980s

° Slow March to Nuclearization

— 1983 Chinese assistance (CHIC-4 design; 50kg HEU?)

— 1986: US convinced Pakistan is nuclear-capable but perhaps
not nuclear-weapons state (‘two screwdriver turns’ away)

— March 1987: Zia claims Pakistan has capability to make a
bomb

— 1988: Congressman Solarz quips Pakistan has a ‘Saturday
night special’ capability: ambiguous but effective
ENDELEMENTIndia 1974-1989

* Dormancy: 1974-1989

* Covert Weaponization: 1988-1989
— Rajiv Gandhi brings program out of dormancy

— Weapons designs, miniaturization, production
capability developed

— Delivery capabilities developed/tested
ENDELEMENTIndia 1990s

¢ March to Overt Weaponization
— December 1995: Rao (INC) on brink of test
— March 1996: BJP aborts test

— May 1998: BJP returns to office, tests 5 fission
devices at Pokhran

* Several plausible explanations (security, domestic politics,
status)
ENDELEMENTIndia 1998-present

¢ India’s Nuclear Posture: Assured Retaliation

— Civilian custody of nuclear weapons
* DAE
¢ DRDO
° SFC
— Deterring nuclear use against Indian cities: Deterrence by
Punishment

— No First Use
ENDELEMENTPakistan 1998-present

° Steady expansion
— Uranium Enrichment
— Plutonium production and reprocessing goes online

— Delivery capabilities bought from China and North
Korea (M-11, M-18, No-Dong)

¢ Overt Nuclearization

— Indian tests left Pakistan with no option in May 1998
ENDELEMENTPakistan 1998-present

¢ Pakistan’s Nuclear Posture: First Use
— Military custody of nuclear weapons

— Asymmetric escalation of conflict to deter Indian
conventional power: Deterrence by Denial

— Development of ‘battlefield’ nuclear weapons: NASR, Ra’ad,
Babur
ENDELEMENTConsequences of Nuclearization: Phase I
(Covert Nuclear Period 1986-1998)

* Conventional Wisdom: MAD is stabilizing
— Hefty Assumptions

¢ South Asia different from Cold War

° Effect on Crisis Outbreak
— Pakistan slightly emboldened to support proxy forces
— India undeterred and has preventive war incentives

* Two Militarized Crises in this period
— Brasstacks 1986-1987
— Kashmir Compound Crisis 1990
ENDELEMENTConsequences of Nuclearization: Phase II

(Overt Nuclear Period 1998-2009)

e Effect on Crisis Outbreak

— Pakistan more aggressively emboldened
* Revisionist intentions able to pursued with higher
frequency and intensity at both conventional and sub-
conventional levels
— India significantly deterred from conventional
retaliation

ENDELEMENTKargil 1999

° India deterred from retaliating?
— Expected BJP response: aggressive
— Actual BJP response: muted

* Constrained IAF and Army from crossing LoC and IB

* Costly curtailing of military options for fear of triggering
Pakistani nuclear use

ENDELEMENTOperation Parakram 2001-2002

* Most likely case for an aggressive BJP response
° BJP balks in June 2002. Why?

* Power of Pakistan’s first use posture
ENDELEMENTMumbai 2008

Lashkar attacks on Mumbai, 26 November 2008
Congress refrains from conventional retaliation
Former CoAS: Pakistan’s posture deterred Indian retaliation

“But when the dust settled, all [the principals] agreed that the
unpredictability on the Pakistan side and the fear that its decision
makers could opt for a disproportionate response, including the nuclear
option, stymied any possible chance of military action on India’s
behalf after 26/11.”—Indian Express, 26 November 2010
ENDELEMENTSummary for Phase II

¢ Effect on Crisis Outbreak

— More frequent and intense crises triggered by
Pakistan

— Emboldened by shield of first use nuclear posture

° Effect on Crisis Stability

— Crises capped now because Indian full-scale
conventional retaliatory options are off the table
ENDELEMENTHow Long Can this Last?

Indian frustration: Traded conventional superiority for
Pakistani subconventional aggression
— Revisions at conventional level: “Cold Start’?

— Consequences of this shift?

¢ What effect will Cold Start have on Pakistan’s conventional and
nuclear postures?

* Indian response to deter battlefield nuclear weapons
Pakistani use of ‘proxy forces’ as strategic policy

Dangerous arms race + Fuse for crises under quasi-
sovereign control (e.g. LeT) = A region on the brink
