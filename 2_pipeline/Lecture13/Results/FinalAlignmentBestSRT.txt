points\nof view about that,\nand I'll share those openly.\nAnd then we'll sort\nof finalize about what\nthis means for fintech and some\nof the sectors and subsectors\nwithin the space.\nSo with that, I am going\nto try to share some slides\nand get going.\nSo that's the overview of\nwhat we're going to try to do."], "100": [1, 20, "as I said, grounded in\nwhat's happening today.\nI'm glad to take questions\nat any point in time.\nThis is a little bit\nmore relevant today,"], "120": [2, 30, "Some of the readings\nwere around what's\nhappening in financial\ntechnology, the interviews\nthat TechCrunch put out\nof eight top fintech VCs\nand what they were saying.\nI will also close this\ndiscussion with something\nthat Boston Consulting Group\njust put out in May of 2020.\nSo just a few\nquestions to get going"], "150": [3, 700, "But how's the coronavirus\ncrisis affecting\nthe financial services\nworld more broadly?\nNot fintech, but the financial\nservices world more broadly.\nAnd though it wasn't in\nthe readings, many of you\nare studying finance and are\nfrom the world of finance.\nSo these could be just your\npersonal opinions, of course.\nTEACHING ASSISTANT:\nGood morning, everyone.\nCome on, this is one of your\nlast opportunities to shine.\nOlivia, you have the floor.\nAUDIENCE: So with\nthe stock market\nsort of tanking in\nthe past few months,\nthat would impact any business\nthat manages financial assets.\nSo mutual funds,\nhedge funds, the like,\nthe vast majority\nof them probably\nhave their asset base\ndeclining in a similar way.\nThey're all working\nremote as well.\nSo you could think of\nways that might impact\nother financial services\ncompanies that maybe are not\nquite as technologically\nsavvy as other sectors.\nBut basically any business--\nit could be insurance.\nIt could be banking--\nwill have to revalue\nthe assets that they\nhold on their balance sheets.\nGARY GENSLER: So can I\npause just for a second\nbecause you mentioned\nabout four or five\nreally important things.\nOne is the volatility and\nthat financial services really\nstands, in our economies,\nas managing and helping\nthe economy more\nbroadly manage risk.\nTaking in risk and transferring\nthat risk and pricing risk.\nBut the volatility\nitself has come along.\nNow, some firms will fail.\nSome firms won't.\nWhen I was at Goldman\nSachs, there was a saying--\nI didn't create the saying-- is\nthat volatility was our friend.\nWell, it was our friend if\nwe could manage it well, not\nif we stumbled along the way.\nBut financial firms are\noften in the business\nof managing risk, whether\nthey're insurance companies,\ninvestment banks, and the like.\nSo that's one thing that\nOlivia has mentioned.\nBut she's also mentioned assets.\nAnd in two different ways,\nI just want to highlight.\nAssets under management for\nthe wealth management or asset\nmanagement field\nhas shrunk a bit.\nAnd so to the extent\nthat BlackRock\nused to be maybe $7\ntrillion of assets\nand maybe it's $6 trillion\nor $6 going to $5,\nthat's fewer assets\nunder management.\nBut also I think\nthe second piece\nthat Olivia mentioned is\nreally critical, is valuing\nthose assets,\nparticularly, let's say\nyou were in a commercial\nbanking field,\nor you were in a fintech\nfield making loans.\nThe actual loan side\nof the balance sheet,\nyou're seeing that commercial\nbank after commercial bank\nis taking losses on those\nloans in anticipation\nof the delinquencies and\ndefaults that will come.\nSo that's a revaluation\nof their loan portfolio,\nand is likely to continue.\nI think I saw Danielle's hand\nup as well maybe in there.\nTEACHING ASSISTANT:\nYes, and then Adam.\nAUDIENCE: Yeah, I was going\nto say one of the other trends\nis a change in the pace of\ninvestment into fintech firms.\nThat's probably\nsimilar to what we're\nseeing across the\ninvesting portfolio,\nbut people are struggling\nwith finding places\nto invest with the\nnew remote operations,\nas well as fintech firms\npivoting and looking more\ninternally.\nAnd within the\nventure capital space,\nthere's been some reports of\ninvestors advising startups\njust to focus more on their\ncore business operations,\nscale back auxiliary functions,\nand generally have a return\nto core business.\nGARY GENSLER: So let's\njust take those two.\nAnd we're going to dive all\nthe way into all of these,\nbut one is basically that the\nfunding, the funding coming\nin to fintech and the venture\ncapital firms to themselves,\nthese two married\npoints, are really\nlooking at things differently.\nThat the companies need to\nlook at their operations\nand look at core operations.\nAnd we'll talk a lot about\nthat, whether it's in fintech\nor more broadly in the\neconomy, that companies\nthat were being funded by\nthe venture capital field\ngenerally are not yet\ncash flow positive.\nSome are, when they're at\nseries C or D or even E rounds.\nBut certainly early\nin their lives,\nthey generally are\ncash flow negative.\nAnd so how much\nrunway they have,\nhow much time they\nhave, in essence,\nto turn the corner to get cash\nflow positive and profitable.\nAnd of course the venture field\nitself is being more cautious,\nand so funding is slowing now.\nYou said Adam was also one of--\nTEACHING ASSISTANT: Yep, Adam.\nAUDIENCE: Hey, good morning.\nSo my point, not\nnecessarily related closely\nto fintech, but certainly\nan important trend\nin financial services.\nSo I'm into commodities,\nand I'm working on a paper\nwith Professor Mirkin\nregarding oil prices.\nGARY GENSLER: Adam, do you\nmind turning on your video\nso we're with you?\nAUDIENCE: The thing is I\nwon't be able to see you then.\nThat's why--\nGARY GENSLER: Oh, all\nright, so let's keep going.\nAUDIENCE: So since you can't\njust stop producing oil,\nlike most of the\nvalves in the US\nand across the globe,\nthe way it's structured,\nit's not a switch\nthat you can shut off.\nAnd I'm sure all of you know\nwe don't drive as much now,\nand we don't go outside.\nAirlines obviously don't operate\nwith the same capacity they did\nbefore, so we don't use oil.\nBut on the other end, we still\nproduce almost the same amount\nof oil than before.\nOil prices took a major, major\nhit, forcing a lot of valves\nto shut down, probably\nfor good, just\nbecause it's not necessarily\npossible to reopen\nsmaller valves.\nAnd I think the\nwhole energy sector,\nif this goes on for a bit\nlonger, might be completely--\nthe way it was\nbefore coronavirus,\nit will be completely new after.\nBecause a lot of\nplayers were forced out.\nThe US's place as the biggest\noil exporter might change.\nGARY GENSLER: So can\nwe circle that back\nto financial services?\nWhat you're saying is\nthe commodity field,\nthe commodity sector\nis taking quite a hit.\nThere's a demand shock.\nIt's been one of the most\nserious demand shocks\nthat we've seen in\nseveral decades,\none might even say\nin a hundred years,\non energy and on many\nother physical commodities\nin the energy and in the metals\nspace, less so in agriculture.\nAnd so that demand shock\nhas led to a price shock.\nWe've also had a bit of\na scuffle between Russia\nand Saudi Arabia in terms of\noil production and the like.\nAnd so how does that circle\nback to the financial services\nfield, in your mind, Adam?\nSort of a brief--\nAUDIENCE: I follow, as you know\nothers look into the fields\nthat they are interested\nin, follow a lot of funds,\nhedge funds, specialized funds\nin energy, commodities space.\nAnd a lot of these\nplayers took major hits.\nGARY GENSLER: All\nright, so what's your--\nAUDIENCE: And some of the\nbiggest companies in energy\nis Zimmer Partners, with\nlike a 25-year track\npreferred of over 20%\naverage return annually,\nso pretty impressive firm.\n[INAUDIBLE] reported a 55%\nloss in the first quarter.\nAnd they are among the most\nrenowned funds in the sector.\nGARY GENSLER: So\nif I can bring it--\nAdam, can I just bring it short?\nBecause we don't\nhave a lot of time.\nLet me just shorten it up.\nWhat you're saying is there's\na commodity price shock.\nIt's moving into a demand\nshock, a price shock,\nand it's moving into\nfinancial services\nwith returns for the\nasset managers and hedge\nfunds in the commodity space.\nDid I capture it?\nAUDIENCE: Yeah, absolutely.\nGARY GENSLER: Thank you.\nSo we've talked a little\nbit about how it's also\nhitting towards fintech itself.\nSome of the funding side, we're\ngoing to go into that more.\nBut what about the\npositive trends?\nAre there any positive trends\nlikely to emerge out of this\nfor financial technology firms?\nTEACHING ASSISTANT: Ivy, would\nyou like to give it a shot?\nAUDIENCE: Yeah, sure.\nSo I think there's\ndefinitely going to be\nwinners and losers from here.\nSo previously, as\nwe know, there's\nbeen a huge emergence\nin terms of fintech\nacross all these spaces.\nAnd a lot of them\nare not profitable.\nAnd so I think\nthe positive trend\nis that firms with, I think,\ndisciplined underwriting as\nwell as actually a\nworking business model\nwill emerge from this\nunscathed-- not unscathed,\nbut probably gaining more\nmarket share and doubling down.\nSo I actually think\nthat's a positive,\nI think, for just\nthe general market\nbecause it is a\nlittle oversaturated.\nGARY GENSLER: So\nIvy's highlighted\nit's a highly saturated field.\nBut for those who have a\ntruly viable business model,\nthat may play to\ntheir advantage.\nWe're also going to talk about\nvarious sectors that might play\nto their advantage as well.\nAnd I think there\nis another hand up.\nTEACHING ASSISTANT: Hassan?\nAUDIENCE: Yeah,\nso, for instance,\nI can talk about my\ncountry, Bahrain.\nWith this pandemic, I've\nnoticed that people who are not\nused to fintech technologies\nhave not gotten used to it,\nand they're taking advantage\nof these kind of services.\nSo I think that even after\nthis pandemic is over,\nbehavior has changed forever.\nSo this is my take on it.\nGARY GENSLER: Yeah.\nSo it accentuates trends.\nWe've already been over the\nlast three-ish, four decades\ndigitizing the economies, but\nnot uniformly around the globe.\nAnd so this accentuates\nthat trend to digitization,\nand it accentuates a trend\ntowards online commerce.\nAnd in both of those trends,\nthey were happening already.\nBut I think Hassan's raised\na really important point.\nIt accelerates some\nof those trends.\nAnd those will create\nopportunities and challenges,\nand there will be winners and\nlosers, as we talked about.\nSo I'm going to sort of dive in."], "850": [4, 90, "This is just sort of\na sampling of a list.\nAnd even in 2008, we were\nfollowed by European debt\ncrisis in 2009 and 2012.\nAnd so the question will be\nis not just this crisis, 2020.\nIs it to '21?\nIs it to 2022?\nDoes it have\naftershocks beyond that?\nI'm here to say it's not\njust the 2020 crisis.\nBut I think you all\nknew that already.\nBut I'm also going to say that\nfinance, by its very nature,\ntends to have crises\nevery five, 10, 15 years.\nAnd each time, people will\nhave some conversation\nabout this is the worst\ncrisis in 50 or 100 years.\nSo it seems like we get the\nonce-in-a-50-year crisis every\n5 to 15 years.\nAnd in your careers, you will\nprobably see five or six more.\nNow, God willing, they won't\nbe driven by a pandemic,\nand there won't be millions\nof people or hundreds\nof millions of people put out\nof work through a lockdown\nto protect ourselves\nagainst a virus.\nBut you will see other\nfinancial crises along the way.\nI have.\nI didn't work in the 1970s,\nbut from

one\npoint, what's your runway?\nA term that we haven't\ntalked about in this class,\nbut runway is what's\nyour burn rate?\nSee, early startups-- not\njust in financial technology--\nearly startups usually\nare spending more\nthan their revenues.\nAnd they're trying to\nwork to that sweet spot\nwhen they can get to a place\nand be really successful, where,\nof course, revenues\nare more than

got\nhuge challenges.\nBut I'm saying as\na fiat currency\ncompared to other\nfiat currencies,\nI think you've still\nseen the flight\nto quality in the US dollar.\nI do think that if you go
