Proposals of dubious legality appear to be introduced as “requirements”

on mobile networks, but can later come back in discussions on how laws
should be changed (real-time access standard ETSI TS102657 is an

example)

National security interests work really long-term — it can take 20 years
from the construction of a standard to a policy-washing attempt

European values must be supported by similarly long-term efforts.
