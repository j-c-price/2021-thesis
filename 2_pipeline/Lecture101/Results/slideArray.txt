The form of the Predict V2.1 algorithm

The estimated baseline cumulative hazard for breast cancer mortality H, at t years post-
surgery has the form

H(t) = exp[azf(t)]
where a, is a vector of estimated coefficients, and f a (column) vector of fractional polynomial
functions of time post-operation (different models are built for ER+ and ER-).

In Predict 2.1,

numbers. For example, for September to November 2017, the estimated

change in the number of unemployed people since June to August 2017 was a

   

small fall of 3,000, with a 95% confidence interval of plus or minus 77,000. This
means that we are 95% confident the actual change in unemployment was
somewhere between an increase of 74,000 and a fall of 80,000, with the best
estimate being a small fall of 3,000. As the estimated fall in unemployment of
3,000 is smaller than 77,000, the estimated fall in unemployment is said to be
“not statistically significant”.

crucial item of evidence?

 

The mystery
of the lost star

A statistical detective story

In July 2005 the Healthcare Commission released its annual

“star ratings’ for English National Health Service (NHS) trusts’,

in which acute or specialist hospitals, mental health services,

ambulance services and primary care trusts were each given 0, 1, 2

or 3 stars. There was some surprise that the Cambridge University

“Out of all the Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (better known as Addenbrooke's
trusts in England, Hospital) dropped from the 3 stars obtained in 2004 to 2 stars.

it is likely there : H ; :
Wal he eee David Spiegelhalter investigated.
ENDELEMENTUnfortunately we only just missed out on
three stars because we did not perform so
well in the areas of delayed discharges and
cancelled operations despite making
progress over the past year

395/417 = 94.7% compliance.

* Rounded to 95%, giving 1 point for Junior Doctors’ Hours
* Gives a band score of 4 for the Workforce Indicator

* Brings total band score to 21 in the Capability and
Capacity focus area

* Gives a focus score of 2.

Addenbrooke’s 3 stars!

This test is ridiculous. Try it. PHE's tool
tells a woman in her 30s that her heart
age is older than her real age because
she's not had her cholesterol done. And
tells her to get her cholesterol done by
GP. There is no evidence for this,
pointless excess GP workload...
