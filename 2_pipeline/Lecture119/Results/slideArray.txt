ENDELEMENTNEURO-AGILITY FACTOR - STRESS

Why do we need to cope with stress?
Losing control over the non-dominant side of

our brain. This means that Learning becomes

slower, harder and Longer. Health: An estimated 75 to 9@ percent

of all illnesses have its origin in
chronic stress. Information overload
is quickly becoming one of the
