00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:30,000
am i t daddy you are going to shift more towards this decoding space that we we talked about the linkage between neural activity and behaviour report

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
8 introduce that a bit you just sort it there's some population powerful activity and ID and I'm going to expand on that a bit here but stepping back

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:50,000
when you think about it again what icon end and understanding from the image of the right to me to the perception report one of the things we want to do it again it's just define a.de coping mechanism

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:00,000
uses for supporters perceptual report activity or directly responsible for his Tas and I'll come back to later this encoding site is let you know I know

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:10,000
preemies in this order rates I want to know what the relevant aspects of their activity are in itu wherever you think they are then that sets at Target for what is the image

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:20,000
neural transformation that you're trying to explain that prick any no response to those particular aspects of the normal response that's what I mean by the relevant ventral stream parents of activity

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:30,000
so we start here we work to here and then we work to hear rather than this on their way around ok so I'm going to try it again keep with the domino set up a talk and I'll call recognition and

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,000
define task I'm going to talk about specific tasks that are for now let's call them basic level nouns I'm actually going to relax that to Savannah Tas in a minute

11
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:50,000
here they are car clock at these are not the actual amount of sugar the ones we use but just to fix ideas for managing a space of all possible nouns that you might use to describe

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:00,000
you just saw and I'm going to have a generated image of me so I know that's :-( piece of images here I'm not just going to drop these off to where we're going to generator only image Domain that we think engage

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:10,000
from the give us control the latent variables do I'm sure you that now so that we were going to do this is by generating one foreground object and each image that we're going to show

14
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and we just do this by taking three models like this this is my love a car we can control the other latent variables beyond It's identity so this is a car as a pretty

15
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:30,000
tape for there's a couple leave variables about a dinner here that relate to the Geometry then there's these position position size and post that I mentioned that are on

16
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:40,000
does it make the problem challenging and we can then dislike render this thing and we could place it on any more background we wanted to and what we did was intended to place them on on

17
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:50,000
naturalistic backgrounds that creatures are weirdest looking images some of the mailbox or an actual hence book this looks pretty unnatural but the reason we did this

18
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:00,000
do this so we didn't because we can had a general space and because it was listening know what's going on with The Incredibles

19
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:10,000
and we also when we built this it was challenging for computer vision systems to deal with this is not humans good naturally you know they did have advantage of any contextual Kiwis you because by definite

20
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:20,000
struction is there are uncorrelated we just natural images and randomly put Alex on them but this was enough to follow the computer vision systems of the time and tend to rely

21
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:30,000
contextual cues like blue in the background singles of being an airplane we didn't want those kinds of things being done we wanted the actual extraction of humans could you were quite well

22
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:40,000
so that's where we ended up in this maybe this no mans land imagebase which is not very simple but not image that just pulled off off the web

23
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:50,000
so that's how we got there and just to give you some this is actually quite doable for him as Australia morning until you at the army to do them for 100ms you can kind of shout out what object

24
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:00,000
rates Aussie it's pretty straightforward they look weird you can do that quote

25
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:10,000
and you're here is the kind of images that we would generate this is this would be so when we think of image bad thing of partitions of image-based this is some images that would correspond a face

26
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:20,000
is there any images of faces on your son Transformations in different backgrounds these are not faces is there other objects again on the Transformations and we can have as many of these as we want

27
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:30,000
we call this one this Distinction mention 400ms is 1 core recognition test screening face or not face here is a subordinate ass is Beatles

28
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:40,000
what is a particular type of car you can see it's more challenging these images like this this is just to show you the set which on them one at a time and Solar mean

29
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:50,000
add and say we're going to try to make a predictive model using that kind of image space to see if we can understand what are the relevant aspects of neural activity that can predict

30
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I am in space I want to say we I mean I need a massage and Hong hu post graduate student that we're in the loud that bled this experimental work and Ethan

31
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:10,000
my name is also contributed to the work so what we did was to try to record a bunch of IC activity to measure what's going on in

32
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:20,000
relation is actually Urban now in this more defined space were going to collect the bunch of human behaviour the compare possible ways of reading a with the behaviour of the human

33
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:30,000
this is how we started when our doing monkeys we're recording in the monkeys doing a task but we did hear was we just passively fixating monkeys compared with the

34
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:40,000
resume it's your monkeys and humans have very similar pattern to behave so what we recorded from mighty this case we using a recording electrodes these are

35
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:50,000
take me and plan at the shows them here you plant them doing a surgery kind of a show here that down in the cortex you can get the size here there about 100 like there's actually 96 electrodes and

36
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:00,000
typically you'll about half of the electrodes having active neuron's on them so you get you on the order of the 150 recording sites and you can leave them out you can like

37
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Tivoli loud three of them across inb4 to record a population sample out.of.it across multiple monkeys and

38
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:20,000
sample of the kind of day we dead this is 168/18 recording sites this is similar to wait to show you earlier this is the mean response in a critically time window

39
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Summer when I showed ruin it starting with Gabriel and what we do here is I'm just showing you have you feel that's one image Years War

40
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:40,000
images of the population factors in a graphic form and what we actually collected nearly 25 this is 2560 images assisted the me response date of this

41
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:50,000
your eyes and now you have it again this rich population that and you can ask what's available in there for a support these task and how hot is a predict human patterns of

42
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:00,000
pause cast asking to do with trying to do more and more recently but let me show you all we were trying to do is to say look wondering we are

43
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:10,000
even though you saw that car you can do cars you but your face is it seem like you're doing a hundred percent turns out you're a better at some things in other SodaStream this is a deep fryer

44
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:20,000
human soap red means good performance Heidi crime in a deep Prime of 3 years something like this in the room a correct me I did primer 3

45
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:30,000
90 song 95% correct in that range is a very high performance levels when you get up to 50 is chance so 50%

46
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:40,000
this is a Way Castle one of three percent correct something for doing Eatery Quay basic level Tas or eight wait for the cars are equally faces

47
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:50,000
please add Prime of different amounts of variation of the other Lane variables position size in clothes don't worry about those details what I want you to see is the colour here so look at some

48
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:00,000
discriminating tables from Woolies or objects you do that at a very high D Prime discriminant Beatles from other cars with slightly lower defryme

49
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:10,000
you can see this that special high variation you actually starting to get down to lower before it's and faces one face vs another face you're actually quite poor

50
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:20,000
a little bit better than chance but it's actually quite challenging in a hot and or seconds without hair and glasses to discriminate those 3D kind of face models I should use a major early as exam

51
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:30,000
you're actually quite quite challenging to do that for humans and that demand of faces so what I want to show you this pattern of behavioral performance you have always IKEA

52
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:40,000
this is humans vs monkeys and what we wanted to do is to see what we can use this pattern this is very repeatable across humans can we use this repeatable behaviour parent

53
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:50,000
what's 10 what aspects of this activity could map to that and I get this car is reliable I just said that and it's not as if you can predict this pattern by just running classifiers

54
00:08:50,000 --> 00:09:00,000
pixels rd1 Invercargill show you that minute but we thought there's some aspects of Ikea activity that would predict this and we wanted to try to find those aspects to sew

55
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:10,000
this is motivated by this video should you earlier so which part of the itu population activity could predict this behaviour overall recognition test receiving a general the code

56
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:20,000
that would work here are some specific task but would like it to be work over any tasks that we could imagine testing he was within the still meme of taking 3D models putting them on a variation

57
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:30,000
add a tired or me that was what we were hoping to do so I can take you through it cos I already showed you earlier than we previously shown that you could kind of take this kind of state space

58
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:40,000
say hey can you separate images of faces from 9 faces using the symbol in your classified as which century weird storms on the activity and now we wanted

59
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:50,000
who does predict human behavioural face performs and monkey cause again they're very similar and Natalie Wood this class of barbercode email that was motivated by the earlier

60
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:00,000
predict this house but would predict car detection with the same model predict r1vs cartoon that's a subordinate ass and also cats again over the whole

61
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:10,000
can you take a sim the cording strategy and take the don't send me to learn on a certain number training samples build a classifier and then I'll say that's my model of how

62
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:20,000
does everyone at his house and if that's true then it should probably predict that kind of performance they just showed you earlier so here was again this was the

63
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:30,000
pharmacist castle your books by crates using single fix time scale Aerospace industry because a sample of writing are single Elvis sing a fixed number of non-human

64
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:40,000
cortex of single number of neurones and learnt a reasonable number of training examples so all of that is a decoding class and models that we fart

65
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:50,000
if this is correct this is what I just said it to predict the behaviour of that we collect for example that the time that I just showed you but also more fine-grained data in

66
00:10:50,000 --> 00:11:00,000
so I wanted to step back to make it clear that it's not obvious that this should work right I mean it depends were in the audience I get people and completely different

67
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:10,000
weather this should working out so you know one thing is like well I get spacily about your Daryl say well you didn't like passive Tas when I agree with that in the ideal world there will be

68
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:20,000
are we doing the cash and then you say I measure William was doing that ass it's going to be your best chance of production but we also earlier that the passing of monkeys still you know anywhere I got a parcel

69
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:30,000
rattle Dieter is is not going to be somewhat applicable division and you know the question is how much are those arousal effects show up in a place like i t cortex which is

70
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:40,000
which is higher up in the ventral stream so you know you could argue both sides of this but it's possible that it was only needed to make this a good predictive linkage between

71
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:50,000
tips to activate a t in the crew way if you like it it's good predictions

72
00:11:50,000 --> 00:12:00,000
critical some people and point out that you have two kinds of different parts of this particular roles which is a prior and the coding space for instance

73
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:10,000
you could believe that biologically in animals boring is some tissue that's going to be dedicated to faces you have to wire the neuron's downstream to that tissue and that means you're going to restrict the

74
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:20,000
rather just letting them learn from the space of ideas if they collected samples of iolite so I think some people possibly believe that even if it's not stated quite that way

75
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:30,000
80 is not directly on your address you could imagine that I mean it's night for sure no one in some regions of I don't produce deficits in recognition of the possibility maybe

76
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:40,000
any train examples monkey Rocco's cannot explain human behaviour reasons that you might say this is -

77
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:50,000
working probably of gas and telling all in this simple thing works quite well for the grain of the hated that shown you so far and here is my evidence of ads

78
00:12:50,000 --> 00:13:00,000
actual behaviour performance out of humans and shoulder releases Mandy prime this is the predicted behavioral performance of taking a classifier reading from that I can population day today

79
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:10,000
volume is the predicted the prime we first chosen Dakota it we had a match things like the number of niraj get it get it in the ballpark so because I'm going as a free variables or should you

80
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:20,000
best wine but for now it's think of matching the number of Mirrors to get you near the diagonal so that you have sufficient number of neural recordings to say how well do you do on a face 22

81
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:30,000
and then he was all the other tasks this is a 64 points and showed you earlier some examples like fruit vs other things card verses on things and you should see that

82
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:40,000
boys going to light up along this diagonal which was well this is actually quite predicted that I can take the simple thing and put it all the stuff that we collected so far and so let me

83
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:50,000
be more concrete about what what is The Infernal mechanism network testing here well this is for each new object we think we

84
00:13:50,000 --> 00:14:00,000
is this some downstream observer a downstream randomly samples roughly 50000 single species distributed over all of 18 at bias to any compartments

85
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:10,000
ejt site out that my say listen in this case we could average or behind a MS when I sure about this is just the version that shown here learn and

86
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:20,000
needed some of the psyche spiking and then listen to 10% that's basically once you learn this heavily weighted about 10% of the 18 of the 18 as a heavily weighted for each of the

87
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:30,000
what does an observation that we have in our day but this is trying to map it to neuroscientist language from this decoder vs out.of.it so what that is a model that says

88
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:40,000
weird songs of 2003 marriage 100ms single unit responses distributor all 80 adventure stuff in here is what your your your mouth instead of encapsulated that's still

89
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:50,000
slimy the acronym out of that and that can't lasa rabb.it decoding mechanism so this is just the same as a hypothesis of how everything might work

90
00:14:50,000 --> 00:15:00,000
can we make predictions for other objects and could potentially be falsified so I'm so far this model works quite well over these Tas

91
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:10,000
equations point a till you mate look at doesn't see all it's not perfect but it turns out that that's about the level at which humans differ from each other so it's passing a Turing test

92
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:20,000
mechanism red half of the monkey 80 is tides in the distribution of the human population that are asking also perform the same password can be distinguished from being human

93
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:30,000
and I wasn't doesn't pass that test passes Justice to book or recognition

94
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:40,000
so that was a touring test of that so it's ok so this is here is a qualified so this is a human human consistency that's the range I just mention that you know you're going to get

95
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:50,000
power so touring test on this and that said the coffee makers and I just showed you this other ways of reading out of i t that don't pass this ways are reading out of e42 recorded

96
00:15:50,000 --> 00:16:00,000
none of them with tried are able to get you to this here that doesn't mean before isn't involved before is the feeder to i t it just means you can't take simple the codes off of me for in

97
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:10,000
actually pretty powder like pixels rb1 representation so lower-level representation don't naturally predict this pattern a behaviour and even some computer

98
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:20,000
weak acid at the time you can see if those you know he's older computer vision models didn't didn't do this but more more recent hearing actually do

99
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:30,000
sure you back yeah ok so this is a little bit pretty aficionados to tell you how we got there as we increase the number of units and i t that

100
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:40,000
performance up so he read more more you decided by T you get better better performance that's also true out of you for but I'm trying to show you this year as it's like not the apps

101
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:50,000
performance that is the good thing to compare a model with actual behaviour alldata it's the pattern of performance which we call it consistency with the Hume

102
00:16:50,000 --> 00:17:00,000
correlation along at dargaville they should arrive at Casa De hard for humans test easy for humans are also easy for the models and you could imagine doing

103
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:10,000
image love all is well and anyway that's what's quantified here in see that we could get up to around you know about a high should your 168

104
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:20,000
corners out of 80 that this point there is about 580 features in and taking it through some things that made it would have time for that's actually Howie approximately

105
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:30,000
thousand single 18-year-old number that's an inference from our data based on a record $50,000 on spot from these kind of plants were able to make it

106
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:40,000
good gas that this is the best this kind of all right here would pretty good with land right there to be consistent with humans and woodmatt would get the absolute level performance

107
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:50,000
it's matched to be for example of them they can get peformance but they can never they don't match this pattern a performance night with a over before

108
00:17:50,000 --> 00:18:00,000
contact an underperforming reveal themselves as not being human-like by being too good at some things right so that's a way to fail the Turing test

109
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:10,000
ok maybe I'll get through this through the same thing this is about 20 examples of care about this I can cut it take you through how it is actually of meth

110
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:20,000
scan Solutions in there and I just tell you about one of them for Simplicity so let me then just take it down to another grains that was the pattern of performance is actually naturally

111
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:30,000
by the first the coding mechanism that we try but what about the confusion parents are now just the absolute deprimes reach these tears because finer-grained 80 like how often an enema

112
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:40,000
is confused with the fruit around was due to the face these are the confusion pate de here I'm sorry I don't have the colour bars up all I'm going to need you to do is take the confusion patterns that we

113
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:50,000
are predicted and this is this is the predicted confusion man if I gave that the machine the i.t. these these ground truth tables

114
00:18:50,000 --> 00:19:00,000
this is what I actually happen if you and eating whatever you decide look at this in this and see they're actually look quite similar the noise cricket correlation is pt-91 so it's still quite good at footy

115
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:10,000
vision powder this do not hold up for Leonie at Point 16th only some people would say that success roller 0.68 high variation

116
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:20,000
feel your hear them all that isn't should be at 1 because it's noise correct it so there's something about this it's not quite right at predicting the confusion patterns of humans of high variation images

117
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:30,000
that's an opening to push forward rates of this is a strategy going for it is we have an initial gas of how you read out of i t in looks pretty good for

118
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:40,000
screen task for now we can turn the crank harder we need more all day that we need more I'm psychophysics finer-grained measurements to distinguish among the better

119
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:50,000
can you forward other representations but what exactly about the ID representation is it 100 Ms what time steel maybe those synchronous codes do some of those things I put on

120
00:19:50,000 --> 00:20:00,000
might start a matter we push the code push this even further so what I take on here is that you don't quite well with his first order rate code

121
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:10,000
start of 80 but now there's an opportunity to try to dig in and say what what what point do they break down and what kind of the coding Miles but you going to replace them with and that's what were

122
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:20,000
trying to do I told you that I T does good at identity but rumour has it really around ratios manifold this is other related variables like position in scale

123
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:30,000
get thrown away but just get unwrap try to remember that manifold Pictionary short earlier and so one of these we've been doing recently is asking because we built these images

124
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:40,000
variables like position pause that was one of the advantages of building images this way and we've been asking how well i t includes because other related variables about the poop

125
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:50,000
the object the position of the object to make a skip through the to make a long story short ATX encodes Natalie has information

126
00:20:50,000 --> 00:21:00,000
these kind of variables which is really not surprising because other is have shown that there's information about those kinds of things before but that's so what time you're in everything

127
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:10,000
V4 simulated the one in pixels and you're always everything up along the ventral stream for the other variables which may be non-intuitive to some of you because position

128
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:20,000
VY the position of the object in a complex background is very nice that's one example but his labels go up along the ventral streaming

129
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:30,000
decoding but what I'm most excited about is that if you do this comparison with humans again you actually get this again pretty decent back why does tide coral

130
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:40,000
between the human behaviour actual estimates of other variables and the predicted behaviour of performance out.of.it in a much better

131
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:50,000
it's not perfect so we can do some gas through some failure of understand but much better than if you read out of me for the 1 or pixel so it says that the representation of

132
00:21:50,000 --> 00:22:00,000
just an identity thing it seems like this could be representation under a light somebody's other judgement at least at the Central 10 degrees for foreground objects as me

133
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:10,000
that's the don't worry about the details on here that's the upshot of what I'm trying to say with this slide but I just wanted to put that out if you didn't forget that you don't throw away all this

134
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:20,000
interesting stuff about what's out there in the city ok let me kind of survey Luda to this a bit I want to come back to car now this is my level 3

135
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:30,000
so you have no idea what you're trying to soul you have a decoder of an algorithm that's a decoder on a basis that's try that looks like a predicts pretty well it's not perfect

136
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:40,000
yeah but it actually does quite well what does it mean and the physical hardware level 3 so you think he is how I visualise you have a cortex which I need

137
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:50,000
what's the 80s it's about 150 square millimetres in a monkey and remember I told you there was about 1 mm scale of organisation I should do that or earlier and

138
00:22:50,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Israeli or two letters surface regions of the scale here this is the schematic that they're slightly bigger organization's 4 to 5 mm

139
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:10,000
you think of ideas being a sort of like 100 200 little this is not a new conceptual idea but there is just the simple version the each year

140
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:20,000
it does exactly the same thing is a feature and if you sample off of that you take $5,000 for the really sampling for only about 158 feet

141
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:30,000
at 1 mm scale remember I don't like that but I should 150 100 150 I should your home 6818 Iran's predict

142
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Karen a human performance I showed that a few slides ago but I told her the real number of Lawrence is probably 50000 mils of redundant copies of that home 68 dimensional feet

143
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:50,000
ATO we think about it so you could imagine he's just a redundant set up about I like to think about 100 features and I teeth which was sampled maybe randomly

144
00:23:50,000 --> 00:24:00,000
stream Iran's better than learnt so when you weren't faces vs other things hey there's lots of good information about faces versus other things in his face patches that's harder define

145
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:10,000
your eyes are going to lean heavily on this downstream runs going to be heavily on I was in your arms and then these do that would make these regions closely involves that doesn't mean you had to pry

146
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:20,000
then anything here downstream version you get something that looks like explain our date so we like that cuz captures that case but also captures the more General case

147
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:30,000
car is going to Singapore from a different sunset in your eyes but you're following the same learning rule that's what I said really right so you end up we think this is the initial state

148
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:40,000
objects and so what we think is a post learning what you have it again about 100 to 150 80 subregions 1 mm scale that are supporting a number of

149
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:50,000
house red off this common bases here that's that's the model that we like given the kind of didn't even showing you the pools learning email as we call

150
00:24:50,000 --> 00:25:00,000
for the nearest Midas to fix ideas about how we think of it as a basis set and this is this I think I'm too service of nicely is employed somewhere things it's somebody down

151
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:10,000
ok but now we have a more Australia have a more concrete male we now I'm trying to try to be physical about about the size of these regions connecting to really a day how many there are

152
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:20,000
so we're getting influence on that from his different experiments and now if you believe it starts to make a prediction of what's now we can causality it's only mentioned that earlier and someone of

153
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:30,000
doing recently so we can start a silent look at the way of dramas this bit of tissue for this is a schematic is someone born in this test and that task-based asked and car test

154
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:40,000
desperate issue only pay staff and that better tissue only car task in this presentation either you believe that you had the tools you got to go and it starts Silence

155
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:50,000
what devices are used to get predictive or parents out of the behavioral deficits at the end when you make those manipulations right and follow that ok

156
00:25:50,000 --> 00:26:00,000
give you a framework for builders predictions and also estimate the manga to the does a fact that you should see it so that's what we've been doing more recently and I'll just get your taste of this because this is really

157
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:10,000
going but if you connect to what Gabriel Satria but now he's tools available to do that I'll put that in from a trolley attack work OK Google has I think of Inception and I don't know

158
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:20,000
you can't do Inception last you actually in a brain so sorry going to try to insert the wizard this is my students working out really wants to inject signals

159
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:30,000
the dream about the MRI could you come in jackets percept and to do that I need to do experiments like this and understand this Harvard interact with it something to talk about

160
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:40,000
so I actually on it and I was like there's some cool acceptance of my memory but this is considering an object person so do that

161
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:50,000
can we reliably disrupt performance by suppressing 1 mm bits of 80 so to do that what we're doing is testing a large battery of

162
00:26:50,000 --> 00:27:00,000
and a battery suppression pants and I just said everything can we affect Feast house at 11:01 imagine we test a battery of tas and then we are in the idea we have a hole

163
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:10,000
and we do every bit of 81 by 1 in combination and we should get all that didn't figure out what's going on mate that's the dream rates were trying to build towards that dream guys get it

164
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I don't remember motivated by this kind of idea great so so we starting I just thought id give you a quick tour of we have tools to start to do this I mean

165
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I am recording we can localizable recording to very fine grain using x-rays I'm so we know exactly work when I teach you like about 300 micron resolution

166
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I'm putting this light up going if I silence this bit of a or in that bit of ideas that you actually do this experiment what happens behave

167
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:50,000
an eraser fries is a poo stuck in the lab started these actual experiments and one of the things of rushed did was the first say let's see if we can get this Silence

168
00:27:50,000 --> 00:28:00,000
genetics tool to work in our hands on the reason we were so excited about that it's cos we think we can make temporary reef silencing but that might that would be the

169
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:10,000
more reliable disruption of behaviour that that then if we started to try with Jack singles which would be our dream but that seems to risky to us we just

170
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:20,000
what are the temporary legion of each bit of 80 do and after genetics is cool because there's no other techniques that can refli silence temporarily silence active

171
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:30,000
euphonik logical manipulations of those last 4 hours so this really sounds good survive him that's what we're excited about it we also did pharmacological manipulation as as a

172
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:40,000
to get started but what we're doing is trying to silence 1 mm regions of 80 using light deliver to optical fibres is the recording electrode and the

173
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:50,000
what's a bit of your ass here and so what arrived did was rickshaw you've actually Stylinson runs in this way to go haven't seen optogenetics plants this is needed for labour

174
00:28:50,000 --> 00:29:00,000
cool about this again is you have the same images of being presented to this Green Line should be up here but I rushed trains delays around right here Shane's light on there and there's some absence Express

175
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:10,000
that local area and you can see attached to shut the thing down inside delete Roblox that you ever seen him put coming in but you can delete it here is another example

176
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:20,000
freestyle example it's not always this strong but that this is again you can see you can return back to normal raidaway right so this is a 200ms sounds you couldn't

177
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:30,000
narrower than that this is what we have done so far and again what we've never say what this is a risky tools and I can work it also a rush just wanted to test something that was

178
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:40,000
are likely to work and so we picked a feast house because it was a lot of evidence of those special classroom of faces that you your gear from dinner can you also know

179
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:50,000
so what we were rushed it was a say ID pick the task in the screaming meals from females we put in an ocean of invariant it's not just do this image access do you have to do it across

180
00:29:50,000 --> 00:30:00,000
want to press relations in this case it's identity is a transformation to using all of these are supposed to be called mail on all these are come female me wanted you to distinguish this from that's that's what he trained

181
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:10,000
do and just to give me the up shot is that you know you always work with Hans a bit of Cortex and here's the big take home and get it 2% deficit of single one

182
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:20,000
you're silencing a bit of a cortex cortex not all about cortex 6%

183
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Innaloo trouser some local bit of 80% deficit that strongly in the country out of feel not the ipsilateral feel pretty aficionados you might look at this 2%

184
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:40,000
that's exactly what's predicted by the right in the range of what should happen and so this to us is really quite call this is how

185
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:50,000
now we are in position to go to see your kitties tools work they do supposed to and now we can start to expand that passed space this result has been published recently

186
00:30:50,000 --> 00:31:00,000
you're interested in this and here is one of the ways we're going for is at Rishi wrestling on the wind doing this pass in the month of silence in different parts of i t this is now in Noosa Mall

187
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:10,000
different bit survive is a different cast lead to different pattern that's what these dots are here different patterns of deficits and he got back to the same location you get the same pattern of datasets

188
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:20,000
call me can't ask but I think it will give you the spirit of what were trying to do and and again this is only used Mr which is known as in Hamilton

189
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:30,000
quieter rebuilding towards here it's just giving you the circuit that's a state-of-the-art so any Miss to measure the specific part of behavioural change and used by aesop

190
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:40,000
each idea subregion Zealand testing many of them and compared with the model predictions I am saying this to main and I want to set a simple the whole Domain so far and giving only just samples

191
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:50,000
what's the door mean what will the train into find domain and and I'm just gonna go get through this just to give you the punchlines that we you a whole bunch of the hero measurements

192
00:31:50,000 --> 00:32:00,000
translate this is now up to 3 million mechanical it seems to ask that we can embed all objects even supported objects of the type of Testament telling you in roughly

193
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:10,000
20 dimensional space so there's 20 dimensions meet the humans are projecting for about 20 dimensions to do these kinds of the taps and showing here which is

194
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:20,000
smaller but you really close to that in the Coromandel to that 100 also features that I've been talking about some that regardless of whether this is these are some of the men

195
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:30,000
projecting them that I can I want to take you through this cos I think we've are used up enough time and I'll get on to this part but would try to find a domain of all Tas will be considered

196
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:40,000
would happen if anything within that dominant that raises questions of the dimensionality of that demand and it would behavioral methods to do that and we've been doing some work on that so

197
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:50,000
leave it at that and if you guys are questions we can talk about that someone I want to sit in the time I really have left us to talk about the encoding side of things cos I promise you guys I would get to this unless

198
00:32:50,000 --> 00:33:00,000
any more brain functions on this decoding site by the link between i t and perception now I'm going to switch gears and talk about this other side which is so I talked about this and that

199
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:10,000
what's the mean rates n i t r something that seemed to be hardly predicted I showed you this one mile there's a lot of ratitie model for now it's ok now we can turn it the codings and Cody science

200
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:20,000
predict the main race survive and that should be our goal if you want explain images to 80 activity so there's need to be predictive and Cody mechanisms so

201
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:30,000
what now you guys are who become Lucian on that works you what you if you know about them already you're probably about them some more so we started messing around in 2008 this is a nylon spy

202
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:40,000
nature this family models before you born Resort Fukushima and there's a whole page Max family and model it really was the inspiration of this is larger this large family and models

203
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Bob is repeating structure that there are now really this reminder publishing out what's really good out of all this really work and so we started Explorer

204
00:33:50,000 --> 00:34:00,000
nearly in 2008 and just this is a sly that you've worries Christina version of this from Gabrielle you know for you take an image you pass it through a set of operated so your

205
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:10,000
where is the diesel dash products or restricted special restricted region like receptive field threshold and saturation you're pulling up rate

206
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:20,000
when you have a normalizacion to have all these operations happen here and that produces a stack so think of like it there for filters heroic orientations you get for images

207
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Virginia for images out we get penalties and get $10 out then you repeat this here right as soon as you keep adding more filters a stack just keeps getting bigger and bigger and it keeps because

208
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:40,000
especially pulling a keeps getting marinere to go from this image to this a veggie stack of features that has less retina tap is a little bit around the tapping

209
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:50,000
and that you can see is exactly a very good male white people like that what help people think about the ventral stream so these models typically have thousands of feet visual

210
00:34:50,000 --> 00:35:00,000
the features of the top level just give you a sense of scale off when you're how they're run and just to take you through the you know I just did you hear about the SIM not already

211
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:10,000
element has like a filter as a large fan in like this like neuroscience related things they have none in the areas like threshold of Iran's nuclear is convolutional

212
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:20,000
which means you apply the same filters across visual space which is like Reddit app that is a few wines cellar door and hear the BMW want cell that's that's another spatial position same orientation

213
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:30,000
casual position that's what the car will come loose implementation of that idea copy machine filter type across the retina and is a deep stack

214
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:40,000
all things that I think of commensurate with the with the ventral stream Anatomy and physiology so but one of the key things

215
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:50,000
models no is that they have lots of unknown parameters are not determined from the neurobiology even though the family might as well describe what are the exact filter weights

216
00:35:50,000 --> 00:36:00,000
what are the threshold parameter is how exactly do you pull hard in normal eyes there's lots of parameters when you build these things such a thousands of parameters most of the hidden in the weights

217
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:10,000
which one do you think about the first layer that would be like should I choose Gabor filter as I should I do some other in home with parking lot random weights right so this choice is there the lot of parameters

218
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:20,000
what is a big that's why I called a family of Marvel's and how you choose which one is the right one so the speaker is there right one I never whole family is wrong

219
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:30,000
interesting discussions so we what I like about it at least when you said it's a model and make predictions and then you can test it so it's at least the Lilo and it predicted

220
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:40,000
entire you know he start the map is he say this is me why this is me to this is before it predict the formula population response to any image across is the area so I

221
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:50,000
wrongly predictive model one still so that's nice but now you have to determine how am I going to build it how do I set the parameters so how do we do that

222
00:36:50,000 --> 00:37:00,000
well there's lots of ways you could do it and I'll tell you the way we choose to do it which was too just not use a normal Dieter it was just to use optimisation methods to find specific model

223
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:10,000
the parameters inside as model class and we chose an optimisation Target this is a little bit of get inspired from the top-down view of what the system is doing what

224
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Casa we suppose the ventral stream was supposed to solve which I already told you we think it's in very an object recognition that's what makes the problem hard so we tried after my smiles for sword

225
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:30,000
century we doing that kind of doing the same thing that computer vision is trying to do a couple doing it in our own demand of images and Tas that we set up we it's actually there is a meeting between computers

226
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:40,000
what we were trying to do with here and I say weird this is work by their name and post-graduate students and what we did was to

227
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:50,000
simulator going to dinner early we took these simple 3D objects you could render them just as before placing my naturalistic background and then we just don't models that will try to discriminative

228
00:37:50,000 --> 00:38:00,000
bully from flowers from Guns still there would have good future said that we discriminate between the sink and these are essentially trained by various forms of supervision

229
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:10,000
you can train his models I wish I could tell you but how we did it and how others have done it I think those details are beyond when I want to talk about today but just to supervise class

230
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:20,000
we're not learn in the same way brain is where most people don't think so but the everything is the end stated his models might look very much like the current

231
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:30,000
that's what I want to try to tell you next show you that we built this mother's was in 2012 we had a particular optimisation approach that we called each and that was trying to solve

232
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:40,000
is Kiama prom social kind of images and I tried your idea was pretty good with humans I tell you it's performance was almost up the humans in which US 268 samples

233
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:50,000
spell the male here we're able able to do much better and some of my previous models that only seem kind of casley told you we construct it cos it mean you it made these things

234
00:38:50,000 --> 00:39:00,000
models not do so well so we got these hi invariants task to push these models down and then we had space to do the model that would that we could do better on and then we built

235
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:10,000
1.0 and then we weren't started to say now we have the smile that was going to optimise performance let's see how well it does comparing with no

236
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Chinese look like the neural beta so here is the model we build a timber 1.0 it's a deep convolutional network and has different layers it had four levels had a bunch of parameters that we set

237
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:30,000
position but I just tell you what we optimise it in tell you not tell you any of the parameters and now we come back to see what we can share the same images to the model that we show to the neurontin

238
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:40,000
compare how well these populations look like that population of his population looks like that and so what we did was we as how well can play for predict 81st

239
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:50,000
what was the first thing you wanted you take a top loader this model and the last layer before the linear read out of this model to do that you might be disabled wait a minute

240
00:39:50,000 --> 00:40:00,000
have mappings it has some na on simulated here around 12 or something and it's only recorded but there's no linkage between that and Iran and that you're on right you have

241
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:10,000
make that Maps so what we do is we take each 18 Iran and treat this as it as sort of a generative space you can Jerry's many stimulating around as you want you just have

242
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:20,000
take us to write Excel data and try to build a linear regression to listen to this as a basis to explain that in the right and that's then test the predictive power on the held out

243
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:30,000
that's what I'm ready yet Christ valid linear regression so I'm going to see your predictions on held out day it was some of the data were used to make the mapping and what is

244
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Louise we chose the we could make the mapping and we did essentially all of them that I could talk about that if you want but that's the central idea take some yourdata say is this in the linear

245
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:50,000
span by this piece of set for can I connect fit that well with this with this when you're racist here from this basis and here is what we actually here's what it looks like here is

246
00:40:50,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Tina Iris part of one simulator once actual I can run in black this is not time is there images as I think it's like 1600 images here so each beer

247
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:10,000
lying down you can barely see is the response the me response to different images and you'll see me group them by categories just so just to help you kind of understand the date

248
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:20,000
just be a big mass because I can ask you can have a bit of category selectivity and then this with no one seems to like cherry images but not all cheering

249
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:30,000
play Lakes boats and some plans a little bed and the red line is the prediction of the model once it's fit 2 part of it to this Iran this is the prediction of the hell out of date

250
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:40,000
you can see the RSL where it is point for it to happen explainable response where it is explained by this model and predictions the

251
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:50,000
will never seen the objects even remember seen by this Marvel before before it makes these predictions here so this is just saying that they

252
00:41:50,000 --> 00:42:00,000
urbanspace actually quite well captured by the top level in this case on this first HR moment we built through some other models in a minute because of

253
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:10,000
the lake faces of the other categories so I might pass the test it out the definition of a face there on this model of this ground was well predicted again

254
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:20,000
it's preferred number for face images by this hmo mulugeta slightly 0.5 there isn't that you look at the category structure and

255
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:30,000
UK police iliac arteries really still here but you don't see you soon blocks you just see the images that likes and some it doesn't hurt you and know what's driving this number

256
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:40,000
quite well predicted I think I'm going to have the ice cream but it's similar it's about half the explainable variance just another example and he was a sort of Sunbury here if you take

257
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:50,000
distribution of explainable variance for the top level the model fitting about I think is 168 sides some sites are fit really well near 100% summer outfit

258
00:42:50,000 --> 00:43:00,000
the average is about 50% which is shown here so this is the median of that distribution here so the summary take comment about 50% of Samira sponsoring

259
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:10,000
is the big improvement of a previous Miles Australian minute the other levels of the model don't pretty really well so the first level doesn't pretty well saying all the fourth level the

260
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:20,000
if you take other models do some animals actually are they don't fit nearly as well here is there distributions and here is there average that meet their million explained variance

261
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:30,000
just to fix the just fix ideas you might take well that we build a model that's a good categoriser so of course if it said he runs well because I seen as a cat

262
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:40,000
here is a model that actually has explicit knowledge of the categories not an image computable Malone it's not an easy one but it's just given it to have an Oracle that's given the category

263
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:50,000
how it explains ITM UC explained 18 much worse than the actual so this implies a male is limited by the real lot and the architecture puts constr

264
00:43:50,000 --> 00:44:00,000
animal on how it at various that that this is just a night in other categories does not easily capture so so that kind of

265
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:10,000
that sort of inspired us to say ok what about if we go down as soon as I can but let's go to be for cuz we had a bunch of me for date and so we play the same game and be for real estate

266
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:20,000
3mc we can predict before and here's the itdata just show you a minute ago and here is the new Ford day that so the v4na answer Hayley predicted in the middle layer

267
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:30,000
where's the best picture of me forever players actually not so predicted less predictive of the 4th and the middle light years and the first day is not so well predictive and get the other models are

268
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:40,000
now you can see they're getting a relatively better you could be going to the lower level models and in there they're getting better which is what you expect but interestingly

269
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:50,000
exciting to ask because what does my was not optimise the fit any normal D2 other than that last mapping step what is a bone spur algorithm class which is

270
00:44:50,000 --> 00:45:00,000
neuroscience view of the fee for class of the field and test the Wii another's hypothesize are important that the burger should might be up to

271
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:10,000
the song of an actual optimisation procedure that we applied and that leads to Nora like encoding functions at the top and in the middle layer so you don't you know you this

272
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:20,000
so this service to funny things like saying what is V4 do the answer here would be well it's an intermediate layer in a network milk been to optimise these things that's the way to describe Whitby

273
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:30,000
does according to this kind of modelling approach now and want to point out is it only happens if it's far from perfect the room to improve your but it's Billy dramatic

274
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:40,000
we got out of these kinds of Miles you take this you take this back to in a big picture where do we do here

275
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:50,000
what we doing as we have performance of a Marlin hi Andrew it's recognition cash received this is what we have been trying to optimise we noticed is that if you plant these data samples out of

276
00:45:50,000 --> 00:46:00,000
the family is black dots or other models I should use to control models that we're in the fuel at the time and this is the ability of the top of them are the top level of the any of the models to

277
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:10,000
80 responses so you know how good they are predicting the this is the median variance explained of single ID responsive and use it as a correlation here you're better at this

278
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:20,000
predicting that and all we did was optimise this way which we think it was like evolution of developments around fitting all day was optimising forecast performance and that lead

279
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:30,000
12 to a model that I just showed you explained about half of the i t response very well it looks like it's continuing up this way ok so what you believe that store

280
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:40,000
then that says it we can optimise further on these kinds of task maybe we can explain more variance and it turned out we didn't actually need to do

281
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:50,000
because again I said computer vision was already working on this and there's a lot more resources they already doing it there any better than us on its original model

282
00:46:50,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Topo stuck in the lab these remote Kmart the times is Christian scared of supervision of August 2013 there are better than the model that we have built now we're in assisted image

283
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:10,000
you know we got the reason why we can see that better regards think you're better at our own tast than the models that we had built right so they were already ahead of us on the task that

284
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:20,000
designs and so they're up here then are up here and so if you father prediction that means these models might be better predictors of Ronaldo

285
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:30,000
optimise performance on task but we could take their features from the Northern to play the same game and we actually explain our spot are they better than

286
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Alex planner on this is a nice statement that it is not even NRL ladder just continued after position for those kinds of tasks with the features that are good for dictors of the

287
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:50,000
keep responses and that's what you were here so that's why I just said there so that trolls take this further analyse awesome order

288
00:47:50,000 --> 00:48:00,000
the summary were presented in the second half now showing that I think phone with her future learnt object judgements naturally predicting the monkey performance as well with the

289
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:10,000
does a rat ATO pick a particular molar which is 100 or second reading this time window 50000 around 100 training examples that's one particular choice

290
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:20,000
cold mile that's just a is a current current state of Dakota mullet fits data banana a day too and we also want to get finer grained

291
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:30,000
The Entrance is this might be this specific error code and decoding mechanism of the brain uses support his task that's we like to think but now which one do systematic

292
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:40,000
kasumi talk a lot about trying to summon spits of 80 is one example of that and the tools are still not like them to be but you see were making progress there

293
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:50,000
the second was so should optimisation of deep CNN models for a very optic recognition castle entry dramatic improvements and our ability to pretty Katie and your response as I told you are my way to Melbourne

294
00:48:50,000 --> 00:49:00,000
car wash on average in the field of our superstar predictive ability Anna uninstall the influences that these encoding mechanisms in these models might be SIM

295
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:10,000
does it work in the streaming in now you know there's a whole set of area we can start to think about doing physiology on the model so speak and that comes almost as hard as doing

296
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:20,000
I'm the only girl I'm ready and so this is allowing if you're designing exploring the me what's unique and Powerful that

297
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:30,000
what's the weather in Krabi recognition of a house having to extend out of that I think it is now people are trying to do so big picture of us for the future I've talked about this last

298
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:40,000
can we pretend here and get a fax you that a predictable can we predict for each image coding model at hand for the article the manipulations we talked about

299
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Dynamics and feedback something that were interested in but I haven't talked much at all about I think that's a good discussion topic I can see how weird

300
00:49:50,000 --> 00:50:00,000
we have some some slime alfredson that regard I talked on the encoding side of these kinds of deep convolutional networks that map from images but the dash

301
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:10,000
give me the only 50% predicted both of these cases there in the NAB perfect right so there's work to be done there and one of the real exciting things is here is how these models were in this

302
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:20,000
we are learning his miles is almost surely not what's going on in the brain so finding more or less super magical motivated learning of these models a good is

303
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:30,000
step I think for much of the field but it's nice is have an end that that's much better than any previous and stayed we had before so that that's that's a Target at Watson

304
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:40,000
might look like you know maybe we can think about expanding beyond call recognition in the question period about that what we when is the right time to catch

305
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:50,000
working with Anna Domenica recognition of the Saturday set up vs expanding the honour cos lots of aspects of object recognition that I didn't touch on here and that comes up

306
00:50:50,000 --> 00:51:00,000
I think there's lots of work to be done within the Domain but it's also enjoy captions extend outside of that domain
