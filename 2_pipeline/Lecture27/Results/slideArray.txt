ENDELEMENTSome features of brain-based computations

* Hardware and software that work for many decades
* Parallel computation (with serial bottlenecks)

¢ Reprogrammable architecture

* Single-shot learning

* “Discover” structure in data

* Fault tolerance

* Robustness to sensory transformations

* Component interaction and integration of sensory modalities
ENDELEMENTWhy study neural circuits?

* We can begin to explore high-level at the neural
circuit level

Golden age for neural circuits: opportunity to
manipulate, disrupt and interact with neural circuits
at unprecedented resolution

¢ Theories can be rigorously tested at the neural level

Empirical findings can be readily translated into
algorithms

Notes:
1. Connectivity does not need to be all-to-all
2. There are excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons (and many types of inhibitory
neurons)
3. Most models assume balance between excitation and inhibition
4. Most models do not include layers and the anatomical separation of forward and back
pathways
5. There are many more recurrent+feedback connections than feed-forward connections

(the opposite is true about models...)

recognition as a hierarchical feed-forward process

1. Behavior: We can recognize objects within ~150ms (e.g.
Potter et al 1969, Thorpe et al 1996)

shapes arise within ~150 ms (e.g. Keysers et al 2001,

relatively well in basic object recognition (e.g. Fukushima
