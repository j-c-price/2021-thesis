ENDELEMENTVoltage and Time dependence

Voltage and time-dependent ion channel conductances are the
‘knobs’ that control membrane potential.

HH studied the properties of K and Na channels in the squid giant
axon. In particular they wanted to study the voltage and time
dependence of the K and Na channels.

Then plot the I-V curve.

This not easy, because as soon as Ey
you depolarize the axon, the axon
begins to spike!
