* Voltage and time-dependent ion channel conductances are the
‘knobs’ that control membrane potential.

H&H studied the properties of K and Na channels in the squid giant
axon. In particular they wanted to study the voltage and time
dependence of the K and Na channels.

ENDELEMENTOutline of HH model

The best way study the time and voltage dependent conductance of
ionic channels is to suddenly ‘set’ the voltage at different values and

measure the current required to hold that voltage. I

   

Then plot the I-V curve.

This not easy, because as soon as
you depolarize the axon, the axon
begins to spike!

ENDELEMENTVoltage Clamp

A voltage clamp is a device that holds the membrane potential of a cell
to any desired ‘command’ voltage V,, and measures the current
required to hold that voltage.

The key component is an operational amplifier
Vou (op-amp)

Lh, vf >—

The basic equation of an op-amp is:

 

 

R Vou = GW, —V_)

where G is the gain, typically ~10° or 10°,

Don’t get confused here. G is
gain, not conductance!

10
ENDELEMENTVoltage Clamp

IfV< Vv. then Ve >> 0

¢ Drives current into neuron

 

* Increases membrane potential

l. IfV >V. then Vi << 0

¢ Pulls current out of neuron

 

+ Decreases membrane potential
Rin This is called ‘negative feedback’.

* It is easy to show that, for large gain:

Vi =v.

m Cc

Thus, the voltage clamp circuit drives whatever current (I,) is necessary to
‘clamp’ the voltage of the neuron to the command voltage.

During a voltage clamp experiment, we step the V, around within the
voltage range of interest and measure I. 11

these total currents result from ionic flow through thousands of individual
ion channels.

ENDELEMENTIonic conductance in terms of single channels

How do we describe the probability that a channel is open?

Lets start with the K channel.

The pore of a K* channel is formed by 4 identical subunits.

Each subunit has a voltage sensor and gate to pore C)C)
turn the channel on and off. ; ~~

Each subunit has two states: ‘open’ and ‘closed’.
‘n’ is the probability that a subunit is open.

Finally, all subunits must be in the ‘open’ state for
the channel to be permeable.

Note that for any given subunit or channel, when we change the
voltage, the energy levels shift (nearly) instantaneously. The
probability of making a transition changes instantly, however the
number of open channels does not changes instantly.

We still have to wait for thermal fluctuations to kick the channel or
subunit open, or wait for the subunit to make a conformational
change.
