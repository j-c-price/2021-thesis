little bit of each company and we're not gonna manage it for them we're just gonna algorithmically\nnearest matically pick a little bit of every start and it was quite an index fight we taken for

traded\ntraffic company it's a mutual company bandura's held and owned by its mutual forwards their hell known by\nDan Innovation and let's one integration of the 99 is it said what can we do to make this even more efficient what if we take a index\nfind and take the interest in the mutual funds and make their Securities take a little change and some regulations but all the sudden we had\nexchange-traded fights is low-cost ways to participated in the stock market the bond market some in the golden\nmarket exchange traded parts all of these robo-advisors in their sort of packaging have suicide week\nwe can get you into the rest and get you out of this into this market for out of this market and use exchange traded funds the second\npatient for robo-advisors of course is everything we talked about out of artificial intelligence and natural language programming\nthe ability to take voice for today digital and transfer that into machine\ncomputer language and and the river is so robo-advisors came along at a point in time where you put basically automate us\nnot entirely entirely but we could you know step back human step back and robo-advice goes in and you could do\nlower price point in the third Innovation was basically some simple Analytics some simple Analytics night machine learning but supply\nnext one portfolio in asset allocation some of it's related

less stress baby more boards\nequities some events that simple but they were able to basically take that answer the betterment started and then\nfind really readily available software for asset
