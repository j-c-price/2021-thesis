1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
welcome back to finntack shaping the world of Sydney ants today we're going to review developments and finance

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I know what you relate to the Capital Markets and since there's so many pieces of capital market have chosen to take the time to dig more deeply into

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
two areas it's really mobile brokerage applications and wealth advice

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:50,000
through robo-advice in such a pine Broderick Capital Markets as well as a little touch you and cryptocurrencies because

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:00,000
most successful technology companies in the Capital Markets have actually been crypto exchanges and some of the

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and Everest around cryptomarkets so if I just take a moment just to

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:20,000
sharax share my screen it share some slides and

8
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:30,000
will get going here this is not a new tradition it goes back actually several decades and so

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,000
the question is what's happened here in the last 6 or 8 years what's happened that this start of Robin Hood and others have really just

10
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:50,000
top Auto V the last remaining bits of of the commission structure that we pack robo-advising and then

11
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:00,000
markets fintech startups more generally walk will have to do a quick survey there and then a little discussion of what's happening in crypto exchanges and

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:10,000
natural ice bunny house because it's really the question will that will that actually transformed or will it stay as it is right now I'm more narrow niche

13
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:20,000
still a 200 Billion Dollar ASIC class environment but will some of those Technologies come into mainstream for NAS

14
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:30,000
the readings again were mostly focused around those two areas robo-advising and online brokerage and how Robin Hood his trance

15
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:40,000
the industry and help Charles schwab and other is entered into by the late part of 2019 which some call the new broke

16
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:50,000
import because of this financial technology along the way questions

17
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:00,000
going here and help me somebody wants to try me and how did online brokers emerge do again earlier Finch

18
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:10,000
period during the 80s 90s that sort of Internet technology fintech technology area and then how Robin Hood

19
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:20,000
or maybe this more recent error anybody want to dive in at all today

20
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I mean everybody what will will be talking about this for the whole class but I just have anybody wants to survive after their thoughts the story and we have Michael

21
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:40,000
ourselves when I think the earlier said that's just the Avengers

22
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:50,000
PayPal just leaving Dua my demons and I'm only division 40 not sorry

23
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:00,000
but we can make it without having to call somebody on the phone

24
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:10,000
in person Robin Hood definitely was more don't think the mobile purse approach so detective weaknesses of

25
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:20,000
electric bike one more smoker somebody to really just tree from anywhere and then also the fee structure with

26
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Jeff Beck I'm playing I'm actually Claire Michael raise PayPal because there is an allergies in that's what this class is

27
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:40,000
about it's fighting what's happening from a strategic point of view I'm teaching finance technology the intersection what about the strategies and there's a lot of

28
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:50,000
there we were in the 1990's some of it even started a little earlier and online brokerage story etrade ameritrade

29
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:00,000
companies similar to PayPal starting a 1998 thank you Michael pulling that together PayPal starting in 1998

30
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Royal wave the internet access rather than through bricks-and-mortar or physical checks for an old credit card system

31
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:20,000
visa v the Payment Systems and PayPal online brokerage store does it does it take off not entirely overtime it

32
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:30,000
story in the Capital Markets specially retail investing and then we get to this other period a new form of Technology lordly

33
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:40,000
mobile phones but not entirely also related to open API and access to the data Robinhood

34
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:50,000
and also in the payment area we've talked about this already a few classes go a lot of these payments Taurus and Robin Hood Jen really

35
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:00,000
nutrients forums industry by 2019 robin bird had almost as many members

36
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:10,000
my mobile app was just a handful of years as he trade or many of the brokerage firms so it's it's it's got that parallels and where

37
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:20,000
been to how Robin Hood Crest further wondering wait or do you have a Robin Hood account

38
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:30,000
and why you might have the money to do it but you actually have a Robin Hood

39
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:40,000
account and well it's hard to do it by the show here and but I imagine that many other students in the class have downloaded the app

40
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:50,000
so then a little bit different area that will be shouting about is robo-advising how is that transformed the provision of

41
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:00,000
password management and how is big pronounced reacted and I'm wondering if anybody wants to just take up a Highway

42
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I heard it that I hope so we agree papers on the topic any volunteers we

43
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:20,000
so how to transform people

44
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:30,000
behaviour from Latin are going through some devices to actually you're not going through

45
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:40,000
especially for the younger generations for a lot more

46
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:50,000
feeling like

47
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:00,000
take a base which are probably were

48
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:10,000
trying to if you like and work through some of the

49
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:20,000
hello flight having some canopy track

50
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:30,000
how to be more like 12 and 2

51
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:40,000
the ability to have an application on your laptop around your phone's of course robo-advising

52
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:50,000
patient rather than having a human but having Analytics embedded in a program give you advice that asset allocation best thing in the lake

53
00:08:50,000 --> 00:09:00,000
second me as you said BIG4 now and big city it's in this case is asset managers generally but also the broker troops firms

54
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:10,000
reacting what do they do that's similar to what we see or online brokerage in Robin Hood

55
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:20,000
that's about course it's night just about a delivery system it's not just about mobile phones but it's also about a course point and price point

56
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:30,000
dive into that a little bit but robo-advisors giving access to financial advice at lower cost may be in the range of 20

57
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:40,000
the basis points of year Asset Management the whole field of asset management the business is accumulating assets

58
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:50,000
and if you accumulate 100 million dollars assets on the management and George 1% fee that's $1000000 a revenue

59
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:00,000
a quarter of a point that's only 250000 hour course you can multiply there's none of these firms really want to just be at 100 million.

60
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:10,000
asset management and the biggest of the black rocks of the world over it 567 trillion-dollars of asset management but the Robot

61
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:20,000
top 10 here at a lower cost white and natural that is also true on the online brokerage side

62
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:30,000
so it's delivery mechanisms it's user interfaces it's service and it's also a course in and

63
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:40,000
price points in essence can you do something better quicker cheaper that's that's coming over very simplistic way to think of

64
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:50,000
but any other fintech Transformers are like you're mine in the Capital Markets that remain you want to see if somebody wants to just want to capture a couple of the other

65
00:10:50,000 --> 00:11:00,000
beyond is to warn the retail side and the volunteers

66
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:10,000
come on guys

67
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:20,000
grabs thank you

68
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:30,000
change to sing with good Robin Hood and whilst I'm going to his cash management of the enter the market from waking up the stock side of things and robo-advisor side of things with the symbol

69
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:40,000
cast bands when is the next product to even better man switch we'll talk about it

70
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:50,000
better man is storage and enter into the Challenger Bank area I mean you're not the only ones you have transferwise from the payment side

71
00:11:50,000 --> 00:12:00,000
The Challenger Bank site absolutely some of these platforms you then spreading out so you could be robo-advisor first and then move it

72
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:10,000
something else are there trends because of data will see there's a lot of startups dozens of startups in the bin text

73
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:20,000
data around infrastructure about what many investors think of is the back office side of things that are

74
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:30,000
exchanges with the public there are many stored Ops around asset management and trying to

75
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Asset Management out and this would be big who is CEO institutional asset management and not just the retail site so let's have died

76
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:50,000
little bit the history of Wideline company landscape and think about this for for mermaids

77
00:12:50,000 --> 00:13:00,000
this whole thing and I put some of the foundation date and the number of customers these are the figures I could get from time to time I wasn't able to

78
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:10,000
find find a figure and TD ameritrade you might think of them is ameritrade both started back

79
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:20,000
early 1970s I mean actually free internet the idea was a lower cost brokerage but what was happening in the early nineties

80
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:30,000
really important part of the saga is out of the 1960s there is a movement that was ultimately cash at congressional

81
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:40,000
us congress going Baba Securities and exchange got to repeal fixed commission

82
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:50,000
UCA for decades the New York Stock Exchange had fixed commission rates set by the members of The New York Stock Exchange

83
00:13:50,000 --> 00:14:00,000
institutional word of the Lord about the larger investors wanted discounts when it cheaper rates in India

84
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:10,000
1970s vs this movement to free that are not to have fixed set rates by the New York Stock Exchange

85
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:20,000
around this time ameritrade started later or affiliated with toronto-dominion Bank lost the Chi

86
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:30,000
each 50 some years later about 12 million years is each race starts in the 80s first trade

87
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Interactive Brokers a remarkable company on the institutional side little less than million and and Sophie

88
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:50,000
moddex bitrate station but monarchs from the 90s and even tradestation earlier each of these companies

89
00:14:50,000 --> 00:15:00,000
a little bit of the old concept of brokers and there were many challenges in the 99 is into the north between schwab

90
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:10,000
etrade and traditional firms like Merrill Lynch in the like the asset managers themselves the big ass

91
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:20,000
like fidelity and Vanguard 3 days of fidelity and also how can we in addition to wealth

92
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:30,000
after a online brokerage if you have an account with

93
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Lord asset managers in the US it's some point in time in the last 20 is years some starting in the mid-90s some

94
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:50,000
eating all the way into the lead not they started the save they're going to compete with traditional Wall Street the mirror Lynch years since 04

95
00:15:50,000 --> 00:16:00,000
and then we're going to compete by are through an online ability to buy and sell stocks garden to the business it's

96
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:10,000
the big bags I didn't notice in everyday and some of them even in the last 4 years started should have discount retail Apac

97
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Merrylands which I keep mentioning Merrylands Edge 2010 was a product care for Merrylands was followed by Bank of America

98
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:30,000
America's thinking ok it's post price is it by Merrylands Merrylands has this remarkable multiple thousand person

99
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:40,000
organisation brokers but they do edge to be online and even Ally back alley

100
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:50,000
which started in the auto lending business was that first Challenger Bank 2009 by 2016

101
00:16:50,000 --> 00:17:00,000
we can get into this till online 4 million members where are we on the story of the start of Robin Hood

102
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:10,000
2013 in all this packet of startups in the last 2 years really of Transport

103
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:20,000
what are we saying as this fintech startups primarily we think of Robin Hood but there's a bunch of others with with

104
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:30,000
markets like free trade and tasty works and we bought have come along partly because of mobile phones partly because

105
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:40,000
even the swabs and ameritrade for still charging now weather is a few pennies this year but still charging 345 censorship

106
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:50,000
user-interface and course provided some opportunity

107
00:17:50,000 --> 00:18:00,000
a little bit about that the Lord companies the each race and mirror traits infidelity in the light for a moment because part of his mobile trading

108
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:10,000
each in this this this short that I was able to get from stockbrokers.com comparison was just like what are the apps what is

109
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:20,000
user-interface and this was an example by better believe that whether you're Merrylands edge or you were Robin hydrolysis thinking

110
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:30,000
interface well with an iPhone Android and self-worth an Apple watch I have to sort of have that connectivity and that technology to be ready

111
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:40,000
used on Aldi's and you can run your eye through can I have trading on each of these products mutual fight and particularly Electro

112
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:50,000
trading after this round etf's but not only 2 years and is the cryptocurrency space came up a number of them said what

113
00:18:50,000 --> 00:19:00,000
cryptocurrencies as well not the each rates in America race with the ramen Hoyts in the end the disruptors were in that space

114
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:10,000
so it's just to have a little bit of a comparison and how some photos think recent developments are really important and the biggest one was late

115
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:20,000
what's called sort of the broker Wars what happened store was the episode that was Robin Hood was eating in

116
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:30,000
sex 7/8 million members now maybe 10 million members and as we saw the earlier number suave in America only about 12 million

117
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:40,000
an app that was happening ibkr which is that smaller but remarkable company institutional

118
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:50,000
in September of 2019 so there were going to go to freebridge for some of their accounts was in a hundred percent but there in a girl

119
00:19:50,000 --> 00:20:00,000
and within weeks early in October 2019 swap finally said zero commission

120
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I think is this is the challenge that we're here were in the challenge of or their financial services that will move to 0

121
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Topline pricing and what we found whether it's in Facebook for a many many or online

122
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:30,000
locations outside of the world it's a zero fee environment and then a business motto was earning money summer

123
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:40,000
in Facebook case it's about marketing and advertising 90 + percent of the revenues really about advertising and marketing if you look at that business models

124
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Marco business model but it may be on the day that it may be cross-selling in marketing it may be on the day but it may be somewhere else we're going to talk about the revenue

125
00:20:50,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Robin Hood and the moment but Charles schwab reacted etrade TD ameritrade or within one week when

126
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:10,000
zero commission it being able to do the next thing which was announced

127
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:20,000
allgomera tree with collapsing could actually say we purchase

128
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Morgan Stanley wasn't going to be outdone in early in 2020 Morgan Stanley what are the most Venerable old line investment banks or dating all the

129
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:40,000
back to James jpmorgan himself the industrialist that though he's deported this world many decade

130
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:50,000
as his name on Morgan Stanley and jpmorgan chase Morgan Stanley buy this year

131
00:21:50,000 --> 00:22:00,000
if you would have told the Morgan Stanley executive when etrade started 30 years ago sometime they were in their future by each way they would have search scratch the

132
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:10,000
having said really we're going to be a Retail Online brokerage for so it sort of an interesting change in in this world

133
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:20,000
so what's the long road what's the warm Road of commissions this this is the march

134
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:30,000
sure but if you look at this grayline this commission rates from $0.25 this year down to about 3 census year in 2000

135
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:40,000
89 I think this short cuts off around 2008 this long more competition import

136
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:50,000
because of Iams as you can see on this that virons we're going up and commissions we're going down so some of it is just efficiency but it's also this

137
00:22:50,000 --> 00:23:00,000
petition that was coming out from each raid at ameritrade on the retail side but Robin Hood sort of venture aware of it still had three four

138
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:10,000
sense commission Robinhood initially it was easy with a mobile

139
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:20,000
to start an account but what they also did he said we'll do it for free their business mail from 20

140
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:30,000
what do it for free and how did they do that what's the revenue model behind that anybody want to take a motor pause Romaine

141
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I'm just saying remain a masterclass would think how could you be so bold as a startup venture capitalist you store

142
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:50,000
watch Banora laugh read free online brokerage from Beerwah anyone cheers

143
00:23:50,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Victor you can either make a profit and a trade

144
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:10,000
stock high-frequency trading as some people who is doing now before you sell your Toledo

145
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:20,000
damaged area to make a profit out of focus on the second with the relationship

146
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:30,000
what day is mobile applied for it's Robin Hood and particularly and high-frequency trading card

147
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:40,000
was that a feature of the Capital Markets was that there were firms that would pay for water flow they would pay a very modest amount

148
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:50,000
maybe a paneer share but they were just to receive the order flow and this is a feature of the competitive

149
00:24:50,000 --> 00:25:00,000
markets competitive exchange markets in the US we have $50 70 individual exchanges we take of the nearest arcade

150
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:10,000
think about NASDAQ and so for it but there are many other electronic markets were transactions per

151
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:20,000
and and and some people call them the dark markets but all of those markets might pay for order flow and then

152
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:30,000
virtual trading shots high-frequency trading shots my pay for order flow that means as they wanted they want to have a first look they want to have those

153
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:40,000
interrupt them through their algorithms and into their either exchange engines if it's an exchange that's paying for the flow

154
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:50,000
frequency trading shop it's paying for order flow and the exchanges have different fee structures depending upon whether you make

155
00:25:50,000 --> 00:26:00,000
or you take a better offer you will sometimes hear discord maker and take erect making a better offer putting

156
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:10,000
rest in bed or resting after into a exchange engine is more valuable for the exchange because it brings other orders

157
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:20,000
the exchange figured out was there after the retail public something for free because

158
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:30,000
entered into two or three major contract with headphones with high-frequency trading shop saying we will we weren't rent to something were selling

159
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:40,000
autoflower firm artist amount I don't know the exact amount but let's call it a penny ashir inside the pricing of the 3 years

160
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:50,000
25 cents at the online brokers recharging which still very very overtime for Robin Hood and then bingo 6

161
00:26:50,000 --> 00:27:00,000
members later account holder Slater and a good at use your face we get into the purple worse were Arthur's dropped the rates as well

162
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:10,000
and so that I can do this interesting zero commission model Shore talks about what

163
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:20,000
the cost of an answer advice the 0 Watts because of everything else and the everything else model whether it's for

164
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:30,000
etrade whether it's for schwab Charles schwab or whether it's for Robin Hood as Victor said

165
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:40,000
everything else that might be in viable for you picking up payment for order flow with the third one on this list

166
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:50,000
margin interest maintenance fees transaction fees servicing once you have a client there is a lot of all the revenues that can be

167
00:27:50,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Facebook how's your information there are other revenues the Facebook and gone but in the brokerage space this is very

168
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:10,000
this was now in the 1960s and 1970s when the lord investment Banks would think if I have a relationship with this big and sure

169
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:20,000
company I can earn money and either way it's what lead in pork in the early 1970s to break the old

170
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:30,000
decades-old fix commission rates because laurige investment Banks wanted to discount and lower the rates for large institutions not for the retail

171
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:40,000
florage institutions that was 50 years ago but that was also because all this revenue potential as the

172
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:50,000
graphics as beneath the surface questions if I can pass a little bit because it's about the business models

173
00:28:50,000 --> 00:29:00,000
brokerage in the business models of investment banking a few seconds in 18 years

174
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:10,000
slake another era questions let's take a look and then have some question when it comes to trade

175
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:20,000
trading platforms thanks usually make money by holding deposits and daily basis because that's a brand new to The Firm

176
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:30,000
especially hard to do so in us when interest rate is new 0 but in emerging markets Korea China India

177
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:40,000
money and you can lend it out in the net interest margin or positive E-Trade or lavender

178
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:50,000
transfer the money from deposit to their account and takes to 3 degrees and then to make money out of here besides this hedge fund our Deals that you have

179
00:29:50,000 --> 00:30:00,000
so great question so the classic Commercial Bank model is exactly what

180
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:10,000
department is a net interest rate between the deposit is money and what you learnt it out and whether you're a trillion-dollar bank for a hunt

181
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:20,000
NZ dollar Bank it's basically that spread between the deposit money and watch your learning out that model spin around 4 centuries and it looks

182
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:30,000
a little bit more challenging and different interest rate environments but that's been there the brokerage business traditionally was making money or commissions

183
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:40,000
commissions was a big part of that revenue model all the way through the 1960's and 70s but there's other pieces of it is well

184
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:50,000
go on just the commission of as we saw natural 25 cents a share a long ago or 3 or 5 cents a share more recently the Anna

185
00:30:50,000 --> 00:31:00,000
when you buy and sell Securities you serious what's known as a bit after spread the difference between the bedside and where

186
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:10,000
is Africa and a market maker can be in the middle and provide liquidity to the market get paid for taking rest it's it's a restaurateur

187
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:20,000
first Luke is the bed after Sprite just being in the floor in Robin Hood scourge Robin Hood said we don't have the balance

188
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:30,000
we're not gonna pay for the bid ask Brad but we will enter into transactions with high-frequency trading shops and effectively

189
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:40,000
access to this of transactions and so that's payment for order flow and the high-frequency trading shops and restaurants

190
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:50,000
it's happened to that bit after spread so that's it that's a dominant part of it in addition just the name Warner that with the many others in it

191
00:31:50,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Charles schwab in Arthur's Merrylands figure this out decades ago once you have that customer relationship that customer relationship will come to

192
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:10,000
other things in and they will come to you to do margin lending which is a form of borrowing and so you have maybe them that that cost

193
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:20,000
who you can actually use your balance sheet and lend them money usually with Court margin lending so I'm just mentioning two of them BTS

194
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Robin Hood was not taking that themselves they were selling that access and then the relationship that you can have on using your balance sheet and lending

195
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:40,000
can you tell us a little bit about the kids back Cindy presentation what's that can you tell us a little bit about the chick packs in the

196
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:50,000
you have my words Jason wank of ultra ultra soft white in essence there's so many different

197
00:32:50,000 --> 00:33:00,000
you might take a customers autoflower and and so access to that

198
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:10,000
you might be the front anmar you could be announcing Robin Hood of Strava doing this but you can be that front and model

199
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:20,000
somebody else will hey you hey the swamp a the Robin Hood and so I think we're Jason Wang Q wrote this is call you that a kickback

200
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:30,000
pizza I saw a contractual arrangement to be have access to that customer and Airport

201
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:40,000
that they're selling are there as well as Google is doing it is really important date it is really important for multiple reasons why

202
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:50,000
the better day do you have the better trading algorithms you can create so port of the payment for order flow is to capture a video spread part of

203
00:33:50,000 --> 00:34:00,000
order flower is the dado so that you can build your algorithms you have more day before your machine learning absolutely there is also

204
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:10,000
other relevant data find a man weave a date is to be a better market maker in a better investor I didn't remain there was somebody else instead of

205
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:20,000
yes my question is about the bird ask margin and I'm just wondering

206
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:30,000
suppressant like like Robin Hood because he had many customers

207
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:40,000
it could get better deals and they could benefit from from from from the flow of customers are they have is this how they make money

208
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:50,000
what's so actually the weather made money is they were getting paid for that flow because their business model early warning and others like them now

209
00:34:50,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I said we will go to the investing public and 0 commission and somebody else will

210
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:10,000
a fraction of a penny at this point time would be enough but a fraction of a penny that's other party would pay us

211
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:20,000
route those transactions to the stock exchanges company that does paper order flowers

212
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:30,000
hedge Vine high-frequency shop from Chicago card citadel which I don't know it's size what used to be about a 20 billion dollar hedge

213
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:40,000
asset management and very active in high-frequency trading it's very public letter desk

214
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:50,000
answer citadel is one of those vendors on the other side of the Robinhood app

215
00:35:50,000 --> 00:36:00,000
with Luke they find the citadel out of the word of not just said it out they fine that that water flow is then valuable for them the Rowling

216
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:10,000
bed to the the stock exchange and that could still be worth something it would fit into the analytics then get better sophisticated machine learning on the and

217
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:20,000
get in that order flow is also something that can be very valuable to an operator of a dark market one of these

218
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:30,000
smile electronic market because your are competing at the 6th year 70 of these small dark markets the rock competing for Vibe

219
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:40,000
market share and then all the sudden Robin heard has not just a few 100000 customers with their 5 or 10 million customers then they

220
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:50,000
ride a lot of water flour and a lot of market coverage for somebody on the other side

221
00:36:50,000 --> 00:37:00,000
and some of the earlier on my brokers they got into the business collecting assets under management they got into the asset under management

222
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:10,000
inside the business is well there's a lot of other revenue streams transaction fees account maintenance fees and even

223
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:20,000
fees and I think you'll see merging I want to move wine now to Wealth Management I think you'll see merging

224
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:30,000
between the wealth management fees and the brokerage fees which is exactly what we seen overtime and the

225
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:40,000
brokerage fee on the traditional Brickfield for decades a broker earn commissions and then they started by the late 1990s

226
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:50,000
with some support from the regulators to change the riveter model the traditional Merrill Lynch broker from the 1930's to the 1980s

227
00:37:50,000 --> 00:38:00,000
commission based broker by the 1990's they started it advisory fees meaning for instance may be 1% of the asset

228
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:10,000
did you wrap with them and if you leave the million dollars if you're wealthy enough to have that million dollars that means their earning $10,000 a year of when you're

229
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:20,000
count if you obviously had more that would even be better for mirror lounge and worse for you because you'll be leaving them a lot of money to just

230
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:30,000
RBA qustodio for your account lordly and to give you advice from time to time and that's kind of the setup

231
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:40,000
the next discussion remain any questions so advisory

232
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:50,000
set this up I'm going to do the same sort of landscape we had the same groups retail brokers asset managers and the banks advisory work

233
00:38:50,000 --> 00:39:00,000
which advisory was Lord Lee for many decades the Domain of investment banks and purple dealers Marilyn Smith born

234
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:10,000
many many companies and they were a commission based business by the 99 is a

235
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:20,000
East ordered to move to a financial advisory Commission number and I can't remember exactly what year

236
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:30,000
99 is even a Securities and exchange commission change some rows to facilitate some of that the big asset managers coming from the

237
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:40,000
the big asset managers managing pension money and managing big pools of money through mutual friends also started to get into the retail

238
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:50,000
space and thirdly you had the broker the swabs and sell for it now I put some names here like Charles schwab intelligent portfolio

239
00:39:50,000 --> 00:40:00,000
more recent roll out that that branding and tells me portfolio is het America's ameritrade essential portfolio

240
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:10,000
more recent roll out for them and they didn't reacting to this crowd this this remarkable

241
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:20,000
mobile app robo-advisors and what better bent in this company spanner gloves

242
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:30,000
and your us in Asia but what better man or not Mag and others are doing is there saying

243
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:40,000
we can give more finished inclusion and we can do it in a better user interface and a lower cost structure by

244
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Asset Management fees for an account in the traditional brokerage environment was hovering close to 1%

245
00:40:50,000 --> 00:41:00,000
crashing some of it was coming down into the three quarters of a percent to 1%. That means again if you were fortunate enough to

246
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:10,000
let's just say that you had $500,000 and you were able to have somebody invest before you advise you

247
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:20,000
set a 500000 is 5000 and $400 a month that you were repairing essence for somebody to give you a casual advice

248
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:30,000
pasterian for Europe electronic security because everything was digital by this one time it was no longer those early or days where you at festivals

249
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:40,000
this group came alone so maybe we could do it at a different price point about a user interface may be better at election serviced

250
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:50,000
somewhere between 30 to 50 basis points recorded or hair for that same that same sort of 500000 if you were to have that 500

251
00:41:50,000 --> 00:42:00,000
doesn't cost you $5,000 4000 year but it's costing maybe 1500 year 100 months now you don't get a bill for the

252
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:10,000
it just comes out in each month out of your account charged as a fee

253
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:20,000
but there's a there's generally a different price point we haven't got all the way that we went with online brokerage to mobile brokerage disease

254
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:30,000
accounts zero fees for one of the great precious that have happened here as well which is off this page is

255
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Asset Management fees have been coming down as well and particularly around the product part exchange traded funds and to understand the field of robo-advisors

256
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:50,000
mention something about exchange traded funds which is an invention of the late 1990s that was a fintech of it's time that somebody

257
00:42:50,000 --> 00:43:00,000
the idea I can have a mutual fund I can have a mutual fund that invest in the entire market and I can do it at a low

258
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:10,000
nak package it through a security so let me pack that the first Innovation was an innovation of the early 19th

259
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Jack Bogle who was the key innovator behind Vanguard said would it be great if we gave America the time

260
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:30,000
they can address the whole stock market a little bit of each company and we're not gonna manage it for them we're just gonna algorithmically

261
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:40,000
nearest matically pick a little bit of every start and it was quite an index fight we taken for grout to but that was kind of animal Innovation or remarkable in

262
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:50,000
super 1970s everybody could I have a piece of the stock market at a low cost and to this day been bored is still not a publicly traded

263
00:43:50,000 --> 00:44:00,000
traffic company it's a mutual company bandura's held and owned by its mutual forwards their hell known by

264
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Dan Innovation and let's one integration of the 99 is it said what can we do to make this even more efficient what if we take a index

265
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:20,000
find and take the interest in the mutual funds and make their Securities take a little change and some regulations but all the sudden we had

266
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:30,000
exchange-traded fights is low-cost ways to participated in the stock market the bond market some in the golden

267
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:40,000
market exchange traded parts all of these robo-advisors in their sort of packaging have suicide week

268
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:50,000
we can get you into the rest and get you out of this into this market for out of this market and use exchange traded funds the second

269
00:44:50,000 --> 00:45:00,000
patient for robo-advisors of course is everything we talked about out of artificial intelligence and natural language programming

270
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:10,000
the ability to take voice for today digital and transfer that into machine

271
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:20,000
computer language and and the river is so robo-advisors came along at a point in time where you put basically automate us

272
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:30,000
not entirely entirely but we could you know step back human step back and robo-advice goes in and you could do

273
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:40,000
lower price point in the third Innovation was basically some simple Analytics some simple Analytics night machine learning but supply

274
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:50,000
next one portfolio in asset allocation some of it's related to if you're in your 20s and you're saving for retirement you could take more risk

275
00:45:50,000 --> 00:46:00,000
higher equity share vs Bond share if you're in your 60s and you're about to retire you should be more stable little less stress baby more boards

276
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:10,000
equities some events that simple but they were able to basically take that answer the betterment started and then

277
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:20,000
find really readily available software for asset allocation they could use products like

278
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:30,000
fines mobile phones were around already so they had a good platform and they should have say or it will go to a lower Freeport

279
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:40,000
and I was suddenly struck to see a real chance of sex questions

280
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Robin Hood business model from George Robin Hood and other start of starting their own high-frequency trading operations instead of

281
00:46:50,000 --> 00:47:00,000
water flows in Endeavour Nas whether movie citadel or any other H1 spirals

282
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:10,000
are really great questions about the future I think that in both ways will will be

283
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Brian platform that's really innocence Robin Hood and even in this robot visor space the betterment of the world the front and you

284
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:30,000
bass player for the 10 not have balance sheets and they turn to let somebody else here and all that Capital Markets risk

285
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:40,000
find it but the question here is do I see the front and sort of building balance sheet and moving into the capital

286
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:50,000
and do I see the capital market said that the should have bouncy risk-taking moving into the front and side and we don't know when history tells us that tents

287
00:47:50,000 --> 00:48:00,000
at some point that there is some sort of which my calls or vertical

288
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:10,000
and if you really think about these be slices on this page the JP Morgan building you invest in 28

289
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:20,000
mirror Edge in earlier time and if I go back to the Brook Bridge side there their name products there too that's balanci coupled with front and

290
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:30,000
that's that's the fully integrated model but then if you look at the asset managers the asset managers black rocks the world or not actually

291
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:40,000
acting as a principal the acting as an advisor pure advise your pure agency business say one of the things is you just want to say

292
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:50,000
agent or do you actually want to invest your capital in the market and that big business decision separate some of the asset managers

293
00:48:50,000 --> 00:49:00,000
and Anna as you mentioned the high-frequency Traders I think that of Robin Hood is going to be bought it could be bought by high-frequency trading shop

294
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:10,000
sounds there there is will they still get is bigger customer base me 10 million customers or is

295
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:20,000
more viable for one of the Lord Banks to buy one of the Lord asset managers I think of you looked at 3 to 5 years is quite like

296
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:30,000
guess soup you know merge stuff into something as you so Morgan Stanley buying each raid as well

297
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:40,000
question

298
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:50,000
I wonder why are platforms such as acorns and better man that you were just talking about ID like I like a mixed

299
00:49:50,000 --> 00:50:00,000
model diggers is in one way they are a robot visor business model but they have savings and checking account

300
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:10,000
step in a food like into a bank in model what was the reason to merge did the toothpaste isn't one because they have the front and customer relationship and

301
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:20,000
some trust and and that sort of helps that something up this is a tricorn uses just and it's got some

302
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:30,000
here we don't know if these predictions were hold but if you see the use of the robot visors it's just getting much more comfortable that folks are being and this this

303
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Levi also includes the robo-advisors at the big shots as well as the store ups but just if you have that user-interface

304
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:50,000
remember we talked about Challenger Banks as well camilo the Challenger Banks last session a lot of it's about trust as well once you have that user and

305
00:50:50,000 --> 00:51:00,000
is there a certain trust and frankly stickiness to it so betterment which is looking to become a Challenger Bank can use that customer

306
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:10,000
then you can build the platform and back to the The Economics of platforms The Economics of platforms is you later

307
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:20,000
tivities on top of a platform if you can grow your user base you get more data you get more centrality there's no

308
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:30,000
going to be 10 years from now advisory platforms in fact in the blue device your platforms I pick the ones that are bored

309
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:40,000
50 to 100 of the said I haven't left it so there is going to be consolidation as sure as we were here at this moment

310
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:50,000
consolidation in the space and so they're trying to build a classic platform economics build activities build user basis

311
00:51:50,000 --> 00:52:00,000
nnn this is assets under management the same website behind

312
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:10,000
as of a few days ago just a sense of what are the assets this is in billions so in 2021 Point

313
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Australian dollars of assets under management somehow associated with robo-advisor so even a quarter percent Fiona storks

314
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:30,000
real dragon in light of possible Evolution I still thinking about work at this go in the future I mean where did Vikings start

315
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:40,000
it's just an online questionnaire about asset allocation and an online questionnaire questionnaire about products

316
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:50,000
and rest risk and how and then usually a list of exchange traded funds some Barnes simple

317
00:52:50,000 --> 00:53:00,000
very accessible running financial inclusion for a lower rates and it helps a lot of people lot of investors sleep well at night

318
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:10,000
where is there uncertainty I'm getting some good advice about asset allocation some rest some life of that but couldn't move forward

319
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:20,000
that's the question can move further and exactly like Camilla said and looks really a question about other revenues can robo-advisor

320
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:30,000
say well will actually be the fund manager will start to actually managed the funds rather than just doing his low-cost ETS and maybe we'll start

321
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:40,000
actually do something more with regard to risk based portfolio allocation maybe we'll start in the circle and do a little bit of algorithms

322
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:50,000
in fact we will start to do trading and the principal is rather than just an agent an advisor and a light

323
00:53:50,000 --> 00:54:00,000
is going to be more sophisticated algorithmic AI or machine learning but I don't think it's going to be highly sophisticated machine learning

324
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:10,000
because there's suck a certain commoditization about the advice but it is quite possible as we move forward

325
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:20,000
somebody will figure out what risk I should take for somebody else Angelo thanks that you can take

326
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:30,000
are you learning in bed in even in index form you could have inside of an index fine what a n t talks

327
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:40,000
is called the Freak Out factor that we all have different risk profiles when the stock market goes out down how likely are we to

328
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:50,000
he says freak out and want to sell and that we could based upon other aspects of their lives should have put that into a machine learning

329
00:54:50,000 --> 00:55:00,000
and have it automatically adjust up and down questions before I think I'm going to go to the Broadley

330
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Capital Markets peace

331
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:20,000
I'm passing here for second but we should have covered the online brokerage robo-advisor there's two big pieces as captured by Robin Hood

332
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:30,000
it might be the two companies that are the lids of the park but they're not alone and then they're in the wealth management side

333
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:40,000
it's much more evenly split where is in the mobile side in their mobile appropriate side ramen what seemed to really

334
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:50,000
punched ID and done well from the chat from what kind of us regulation is

335
00:55:50,000 --> 00:56:00,000
the likes of Robin Hood to expand globally or two tracks capital from abroad

336
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:10,000
is a highly regulated space in both the advisory sign the bridge side and Robin Hood would certainly need to be aware of that and red

337
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:20,000
appropriately as a broker dealer here in the US and and then the asset management side there is a little bit different regulator

338
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:30,000
awesome regulated here attracting capital overseas if the capitals just investing Robyn Hyde in one of their

339
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:40,000
venture rounds BCD rounds because private placements lordly speaking other than the

340
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:50,000
regulations around sanctions and anti money laundering a be straightforward if it's actually customers using the platform customers using the

341
00:56:50,000 --> 00:57:00,000
then a ramen word would have to be aware of the regulations in that jurisdiction whether the regulations in Europe or in your home country look in Korea

342
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:10,000
there is customer-facing applications Robin Hood career would have to think do they register as a broker dealer in Korea Japan and

343
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:20,000
as they they are in fact just a mobile application for a traditional farm investment to appropriate for

344
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:30,000
so against heard of trying to capture Capital Markets is a vest

345
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Harry of activities from accessing capital to trading platforms like in this this slide from Mackenzie just

346
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:50,000
choose an earlier stage where is fintech in each of these and I'm not going to go through each of these buckets port of why I have this is it's

347
00:57:50,000 --> 00:58:00,000
many little buckets we talked about 2 on the retail side their crowdfunding platforms literally platforms that help

348
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:10,000
raise money there is trade execution and I'm going to talk about a couple in a minute decentralized trading platforms like an cryptocurrencies

349
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:20,000
how do I say centralise trading platforms in cryptocurrencies but even in the last few years of from port icx is a stored up in Tradex

350
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:30,000
it's a new trading platform there is post trade services is a lot of infrastructure and operations the Capital Markets

351
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:40,000
multi-trillion our business Global insurance so I'm just going to quickly should have touch a pun

352
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:50,000
and in these next couple of slides you can see I pick some like doesn't know so firms that we're just ones I kind of like to watch and fall out

353
00:58:50,000 --> 00:59:00,000
take any questions about each of these butter or number of them in the Wealth Management space and one of the things in Wealth Management

354
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:10,000
betterment is facing the retail public but there are startups that are in the wealth management face facing furniture advisor

355
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:20,000
thousands of financial advisers better software in in a number of other saw actually

356
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:30,000
forms for the Phineas advice advise you that's trying to build a business wants software and access to

357
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:40,000
the Capital Markets interface between the two there is a boy in it

358
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:50,000
collateral management in Ipswich structure cloud moorigin literally collateral management

359
00:59:50,000 --> 01:00:00,000
you're moving on derivatives in the institutional market for collateral that you're moving even as it relates to the lounge and

360
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:10,000
can I store a platform that might be a little better for collateral management and take some of the Back Office cost out of it to be outdone you could have did

361
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:20,000
encumbrance as well as equity progress what we were talking about the stock market and this company called elephant I mention

362
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Jack stored in 2012 it's to be a competitive stock market Anasta at New York Stock Exchange started by a bunch of

363
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:40,000
by side institutions for instance and sometimes it's just research

364
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:50,000
put together a remarkable database on the financial business of venture capital Branson's

365
01:00:50,000 --> 01:01:00,000
different spaces back to sort of thinking about the different aspects of Capital Markets crowdfunding platform

366
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:10,000
trade execution post trade side of it I don't do this to be like a full course on Capital Markets but it's still open your server

367
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:20,000
I thinking too it's not just the retail in her face it's not just using a mobile phone good day good use

368
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:30,000
3 and lower cost and that's really the Robin Hood betterment side it's also a lot of taking the paper flows out of it all

369
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:40,000
process is out of the back office and trying to should have provide a service to the Capital Markets in a better way

370
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Romania to anyone has a question on this topic

371
01:01:50,000 --> 01:02:00,000
no I think we're just closed out cryptomarkets a bit and some of you take the Crypt of Finance course

372
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:10,000
a little bit repetitive just wondering that's interesting is this crypto market came or is there a question here

373
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Luke has his hand raised

374
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:30,000
crypto market came alarm about a dozen years ago in by an early stage of these markets somebody said

375
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:40,000
can you buy and sell Bitcoin any created exchange is a new form of it's not 44

376
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:50,000
currency for cryptocurrencies and these exchanges act as agents matching buyers and sellers like traditional changes

377
01:02:50,000 --> 01:03:00,000
but they also act as market makers we talked to her about capturing btspread these exchanges could also buy and sell from customers

378
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:10,000
all of them do but they could traditional exchanges tonight and they also acted as a custody and how is your farts and even to this day if you trade on

379
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:20,000
show exchange you're moving your asset through the use of what's called a private key but you're moving your asset

380
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:30,000
crypto exchange and there are the custody of The Custodian the public has Direct Access and this is a very different

381
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:40,000
traditional exchanges in the question will be will this come to traditional markets and that's why I wanted to focus on this minute in tradition

382
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:50,000
markets built a pine a business model that it's multiple centuries-old you and I or not members directly of the New York Stock Exchange we have to go

383
01:03:50,000 --> 01:04:00,000
somebody to get to the New York Scottish it's got a broker it's got a member of the New York Stock Exchange of the London stock exchange of the Shanghai stock exchange

384
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:10,000
markets in his cryptomarkets everybody can access directly the markets the markets actually interestingly have to have a much more

385
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:20,000
API for the retail public the New York Stock Exchange in line it's such a change to have a robot

386
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:30,000
application program interface for institutions and it has to be very high volume very resilient but it could be limited to

387
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:40,000
hundreds are at most a couple thousands of users even if the Biomes are high these exchanges have to be open to millions

388
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:50,000
more from their home laptops in Melbourne farms a very different architecture where is disintermediated the broker-dealers and the question

389
01:04:50,000 --> 01:05:00,000
which is on the ansible right now will this be something moving for will we see a direct Access model it any

390
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:10,000
around the cloud where will we stay in the intermediated access is a lot of regulatory reasons weed stay in the animated access for some competitive reasons brokers

391
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:20,000
want to have frogs going directly by the technology

392
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:30,000
sell these markets by the way are not well regulated and there are rife with fraud and scams and manipulation so I just want to mention

393
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:40,000
see if you hear it's an additional looks so maybe we should fast and still

394
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:50,000
so what do you think would happen if the big bang started holding more crypto in their balance sheets right if they

395
01:05:50,000 --> 01:06:00,000
what age for example on operations regulation with this as well and therefore living Proprietary trading or do you think you'll be different

396
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:10,000
a lot of questions in there the lord Banks around the globe today have not been active in the ASIC

397
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Claus is about 225 billion dollars as of this morning which is smaller the worldwide Capital Markets are between 3

398
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:30,000
100 trillion when you add equities and blinds worldwide and in comparison

399
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Victoria reasons and for customer registration to large Banks haven't really can't yes it would be just

400
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:50,000
any other asset they have any commodity you hold Bitcoin you might think if you're joking Morgan I'm now holding it

401
01:06:50,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Barclays bank I'm now I'm holding it what regulations if it's Bitcoin it would be very similar to the regulations around holding gold or silver maybe

402
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:10,000
silver futures are four contracts holding gold silver and to the extent that there was a

403
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Frank if there are any rules and regulations that have died Frank that would generally ask for the trading accounts it would be a fake order these trading account

404
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:30,000
big challenge for big institutions as custody custody has been a challenge and was interesting as fidelity

405
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:40,000
SAS manage the world started something for fidelity digital asset holding I believe that's the name were there you're providing a custody Sully

406
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:50,000
coinbase which is a lord crypto exchange has a custody solution the order the New York Stock Exchange in a continent or exchange started back

407
01:07:50,000 --> 01:08:00,000
the 882 Baptist trading crypto markets but also providing a custody solution and why I'm focusing on Costa de

408
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:10,000
one of the challenges in this small asset class is how to hold the digital asset in the traditional markets in the tradition

409
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:20,000
there are centralised organisation's that operators clearinghouse

410
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:30,000
always the odds with digital custody in the US it's got dtcc and other countries different names but how do you

411
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:40,000
in essence the cryptocurrency is installing and these crypto exchanges have had lots of stolen

412
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:50,000
cryptocurrency cos why aren't you still with god the private key that affected me the password you have the digital asset

413
01:08:50,000 --> 01:09:00,000
is Luke's question cryptocurrency in cryptocurrency class which I don't have the luxury of taking

414
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:10,000
we have the app to check next semester for next year then is it because of the security

415
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:20,000
implement customers the option to buy us equity with bitcoin overseas because they would allow them to jump over

416
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Nations regulations Chinese customer is all cream customers who wants to invest in

417
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:40,000
briefly I think the regulation for anyone platform my Robinhood around cryptocurrencies is a bit

418
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:50,000
has a manager restrictions in manager restrictions we have not got the place where you can fill half that we have Robos

419
01:09:50,000 --> 01:10:00,000
investor protection regime on cryptocurrency and in fact in most jurisdictions it's pretty shaky it's pretty still

420
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:10,000
undeveloped I'm talking about investor protection so ROM Android may have made a choice if you're going to trade you in a trade

421
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:20,000
currency vs buying and selling stocks and that would be an appropriate business decision that they made until there is a more

422
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:30,000
a robust and satisfactory both investor protection and also according against the list of activity

423
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:40,000
cryptocurrency stored in emanated out of a little bit of an off the grid sofa Punk movement and I use the word

424
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Cyberpunk with a mailing less that satoshi nakamoto uploaded that 8 page paper and 12 years ago and

425
01:10:50,000 --> 01:11:00,000
you can track Bitcoin transaction a lot of use of bitcoin in other cryptocurrencies has been to avoid the censorship

426
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:10,000
the watchful eyes of the official sachar and so I would imagine I'm not I'm not talk to Robin work that they would be aware of that and they were just

427
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:20,000
as per the legal matter in his for reputational reasons that are not to go there in unless there is a more robust

428
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:40,000
yeah I should have 2 questions on Wealth Management Centre so the first question what do you think more important for a walk management centre to grow

429
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:50,000
the intrusion part meaning like a low minimum deposit or the user experience part that is for the first question and for the second question given the

430
01:11:50,000 --> 01:12:00,000
broadcast management picture like well front do you think now customers priva a simple product more complex product

431
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:10,000
I'm not sure but I think that the better mentioned in the robot visors I can't separate the two when you're saying

432
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:20,000
more about user interfaces at more about pricing maybe somebody better than I think it's about but I really do think

433
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:30,000
I think that they have provided a lower price point which is really important but if it were only that

434
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:40,000
if somebody has just put out an advertisement I'm going to give you wealth advice for a quarter of a pint I don't think you could have got an adoption I think you had to

435
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:50,000
that user an update and I think the two of them together are really important so it's not just doing something cheaper

436
01:12:50,000 --> 01:13:00,000
because a lot of people could say listen I'll give you wealth advice for porter replying I think the user experience these are very proud

437
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:10,000
sometimes it's just frankly a little easier it's interesting to just can't go to a drop down menu answer some questions feel that I'm getting the advice

438
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:20,000
yoghurt I'm yes getting low cost ET apps and low-cost advisory fees but I think the user experience goes hand in hand at I can't usually separate

439
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:30,000
let me just try to wrap up in in then and then ID remind me the second heavier question as I wrap up cos I want to make it we only ever

440
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:40,000
I want to just make a point behind this crypto exchanges there's a bunch of crypto landing in borrowing and why I raise this is this more

441
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:50,000
just like the capital market is starting to say can I rent crypto can I borrow crypto and why would you do that same reason in the car

442
01:13:50,000 --> 01:14:00,000
land and borrow stock sometimes cause you want to buy the stocks on Moreton or sometimes you learnt it because you need to borrow against your assets to do

443
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:10,000
so these markets are developing that way but the thing that I wanted to mention was this question of decentralised pronounce V

444
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:20,000
centralise traditional this is a slide that I should have created in last 8 mine's has

445
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:30,000
hi Terry software Central clearing all the attributes that I list here the question is is there a market just like we talked about in landing for

446
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Europe year decentralised for Nas and what we found in lending Club another company's it really haven't stayed decentralized

447
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:50,000
already with this concept that will be peers learning to peers and then what we found is there become more Marketplace platforms and platform economics

448
01:14:50,000 --> 01:15:00,000
but there is business question can you be an open source software built on blockchain technology that truly peer-to-peer and you will

449
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:10,000
time and again is a business concept that I just want to prepare you for decentralized finance vs traditional

450
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:20,000
usually used in the context of blockchain Technology and The Advocate seguaci technology facilitates we can get rid

451
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:30,000
bags that is what they might say that's what's the Tertiary nakamoto Road in some of the Rowley emails and and so forth that we

452
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:40,000
disintermediation both banks and central Banks around cryptocurrency and the light that's the that's the dream but the question is

453
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:50,000
network economics where there's a reason and Capital Markets symphoniacs that you have heard of a hub and spoke approach rather than a decentralized approach when I say

454
01:15:50,000 --> 01:16:00,000
spell the New York stock exchange rate one in stock exchanges in search of in the middle of the market that the bag Spectra Luca earlier question is sitting there collect

455
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:10,000
a net interest margin and why lendingclub is moved into a marketplace platform rather than that cute of here and said this debate

456
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:20,000
business concept is a relatively important wine in it in it basically goes well beyond cryptocurrencies and I wanted to mention it but in crypt

457
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:30,000
current season this is my last little bit is that there or defy platforms decentralised forneus will you can Pier Pier

458
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:40,000
use a crypto exchange by nearside xu2 swap others basically say we're not going to have a Central exchange or

459
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:50,000
technically a Central limit order book and I could trade and later nautical trade with Luke with somebody else but it's not

460
01:16:50,000 --> 01:17:00,000
and similarly there is platforms maker down compound and since the next for the three big ones that are trying to do that on crypto lending and

461
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:10,000
there's even prediction marking markets that are trying to say Nadia can trade with Luke and make a bat

462
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Victoria environment for this prediction markets is highly challenged and they might be doing things that are not strictly within the

463
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:30,000
what is decentralised markets are very small none of these projects are really big butts

464
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:40,000
projects have a few billion dollars in their crypto landing in borrowing some of these exchanges have a few $100,000 a day of trading the not big four

465
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:50,000
it raises this Central question of traditional Phineas v decentralized now I just wanted to capture that before we signed off

466
01:17:50,000 --> 01:18:00,000
today
