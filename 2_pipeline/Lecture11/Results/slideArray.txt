Act as agents (matching buyers & sellers) -- Traditional exchanges do as well

Act as market makers (buying & selling from customers) -- Traditional exchanges don’t

Hold customer funds in Custody -- Traditional exchanges don’t

Public has direct access -- Traditional exchanges must go through a broker

Lend money to customers for margin trading -- Securities markets use brokers or banks
Crypto fees wide vs. Traditional markets

Crypto Market Largely traded on Crypto only platforms — lacking direct fiat capabilities

Not regulated for market integrity rules, rife with fake volumes and manipulation

List tokens for fees similar to equity markets but different than currency markets
