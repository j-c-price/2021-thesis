{"0": [0, 90, "[SQUEAKING]\n[RUSTLING]\n[CLICKING]\nGARY GENSLER: Welcome\nback to FinTech,\nShaping the World of Finance.\nToday, we're going to\nreview developments\nin finance and technology\nrelated to capital markets.\nAnd since there's so many\npieces with capital markets,\nI've chosen to take the time\nto dig more deeply into two\nareas, online brokerage,\nor really mobile brokerage\napplications, and wealth\nadvising through robo advising.\nBut we'll touch upon the broader\ncapital markets as well as\na little touch on\ncryptocurrencies\nbecause some of the most\nsuccessful financial technology\ncompanies in the capital\nmarkets have actually\nbeen crypto exchanges\nand some of the endeavors\naround crypto markets.\nSo if I just take a moment just\nto share my screen and share\nsome slides, and\nwe'll get going here.\nOnline brokerage, this\nis not a new tradition.\nIt goes back actually\nseveral decades."], "90": [1, 50, "happened here in the\nlast six or eight years?\nWhat's happened that this\nstartup Robinhood and others\nhave really just toppled\nover the last remaining\nbits of the commission\nstructure that we've had?\nRobo advising and\nthen capital markets,\nFinTech startups more generally.\nWe'll have to do a quick\nsurvey there and then\na little discussion\nof what's happening\nin crypto exchanges and\ndecentralized finance,\nbecause it's really\nthe question,\nwill that actually\ntransform finance,\nor will it stay as\nit is right now,\na more narrow niche, though,\nstill a $200 billion asset\nclass environment?\nBut will some of\nthose technologies\ncome into mainstream finance?"], "140": [2, 30, "focused around those\ntwo areas, robo advising\nand online brokerage, and\nhow Robinhood has transformed\nthe industry, and how Charles\nSchwab and others entered\ninto by the late part of 2019\nwhat some call the New Broker\nWars, in part because of\nthis financial technology\nalong the way."], "170": [3, 590, "And hopefully somebody\nwants to chime in.\nHow did online brokers\nemerge during an earlier\nFinTech development\nperiod, during the '80s,\n'90s, that sort of\ninternet technology,\nFinTech technology area?\nAnd then how Robinhood's\ntransformed maybe\nthis more recent era.\nRomain, does anybody\nwant to dive in at all?\nROMAIN: Let's see.\nWho will be the first\nvolunteer today?\nGARY GENSLER: I mean,\neverybody, we'll be talking\nabout this for the whole class.\nBut I just-- if anybody wants to\noffer their thoughts to start.\nROMAIN: And we have Michael.\nAUDIENCE: Yeah.\nSo when I think the\nearlier FinTech startups,\nI think just thinking\nof edge of the internet.\nI'm thinking like\nPayPal, just ways\nyou can do online payments\nand online interfaces for--\nor sorry, not online brokers.\nI'm thinking of E*TRADE, but\nways to make it without having\nto call somebody on the phone.\nI guess it was probably more\ninaccessible when you actually\nhad to drive to the broker\ndirectly or in-person.\nRobinhood definitely\nwas more starting\nto take the mobile-first\napproach, started\ntackling weaknesses of\nthe larger platforms,\nsuch as user interface, make\nit more accessible for somebody\nto really just\ntrade from anywhere.\nAnd then also the fee\nstructure was a huge part\nof that, too, for trading.\nGARY GENSLER: Yeah.\nBut I'm glad--\nI'm actually glad\nMichael raised PayPal,\nbecause there's\nanalogies, and that's\nwhat this class is really about.\nIt's finding what's happening\nfrom a strategic point of view.\nWe're teaching finance,\ntechnology, the intersection\nbut about the strategies.\nAnd there's a lot of parallel.\nThere we were in the 1990s.\nSome of it even started\na little earlier.\nAnd online brokerage started--\nE*TRADE, Ameritrade.\nWe'll dive into a number\nof these companies\nsimilar to PayPal\nstarting in 1998.\nSo I thank you, Michael,\nfor pulling that together--\nPayPal starting in 1998.\nThat earlier wave, the\ninternet, access rather than\nthrough bricks and mortar,\nor physical checks,\nor an old credit card\nsystem vis-a-vis the payment\nsystems in PayPal, online\nbrokerage starts, emerges.\nDoes it take off?\nNot entirely.\nBut over time, it's a big\nstory in the capital markets,\nespecially retail investing.\nAnd then we get to\nthis other period,\na new form of technology,\nlargely about mobile phones,\nbut not entirely about\nmobile phones also related\nto open API and\naccess to the data.\nRobinhood comes along.\nAnd also in the\npayment area-- we've\ntalked about this already\na few classes ago-- a lot\nof these payment startups.\nAnd Robinhood GEN really\nfurther transforms an industry.\nAnd by 2019, Robinhood had\nalmost as many members online\nthrough their mobile app\nwith just a handful of years\nas E*TRADE or many of\nthe brokerage firms.\nSo it's got that\nparallels, and we're\ngoing to dive into how\nRobinhood pressed further.\nAnd I'm wondering, Michael, do\nyou have a Robinhood account?\nAUDIENCE: Yeah, but I\nhaven't really used it\nsince I started paying loans.\nGARY GENSLER: Oh, no.\nI understand why you\nmight not be investing\nwhile you're in school\nand why you might not\nhave the money to do\nit, but you actually\nhave a Robinhood account.\nAnd while it's hard to\ndo it by a show of hands,\nbut I imagine that many\nother students in the class\nhave downloaded the app.\nSo then a little\nbit different area\nthat we're going to be chatting\nabout is robo advising.\nHow has that transformed the\nprovision of retail investment\nmanagement, and how is\nbig finance reacting?\nAnd I'm wondering if, Romain,\nif anybody wants to just take\na high level hit at that.\nROMAIN: I hope so.\nWe had great papers\non the topic.\nAny volunteers?\nWeiyi?\nAUDIENCE: Sure.\nSo I guess from the robot\nadvisor perspective is sort of,\nI personally feel, is a how\nto transform people's behavior\nfrom like now going to some\nkind of financial advisors\nto actually you're\nnow going through more\nelectronic platforms,\nwhereas traditionally,\nespecially for maybe the younger\ngenerations were a lot more\nused to doing things online.\nI think robot advisors\nprovide them a new way\nto construct their financial\nportfolios rather than going\nto a financial advisor.\nSo it's definitely feeling like\nit's going to take a bite out\nof the existing financial\nadvisors, which are probably\nwhere we're talking about\nfrom the retail asset manager\nperspective.\nSome of them are trying\nto, I feel like, emerge\nor creating new platforms,\nor either buying\nsome of the existing\nplatforms, or having some kind\nof interaction with them.\nSo the existing-- the asset\nmanagers are definitely,\nI feel like, looking\nmore into how\nto incorporate more tools\nto come to the [INAUDIBLE]\non the [INAUDIBLE].\nGARY GENSLER: Right.\nSo robo advising,\nthe ability to have\nan application on your laptop\nor on your phones, of course.\nRobo advising,\nhaving an application\nrather than having a\nhuman but having analytics\nembedded in a program give you\nadvice about asset allocation,\ninvesting, in the like.\nAnd then secondly, as\nyou said, big finance.\nAnd big finance in this case\nis asset managers, generally,\nbut also the brokerage\nfirms reacting.\nWhat do they do?\nThere's one other thing\nthat's similar to what\nwe see on online\nbrokerage and Robinhood.\nAnd that's about costs.\nIt's not just about\na delivery system.\nIt's not just about\nmobile phones,\nbut it's also about a cost\npoint and a price point.\nAnd we'll dive into\nthat a little bit,\nbut robo advisors giving access\nto financial advice at lower\ncosts, maybe in the range of\n20 to 50 basis points a year.\nAsset management,\nthe whole field\nof asset management, the\nbusiness of asset management\nis accumulating assets\nunder management.\nAnd if you accumulate\n$100 million\nof assets under management\nand charge 1% fee,\nthat's $1 million of revenue.\nIf you only charge a quarter of\na point, that's only $250,000\nof revenues.\nNow, of course, you can multiply\nbecause none of these firms\nreally want to just be\nat $100 million of assets\nunder management.\nAnd the biggest, BlackRocks of\nthe world are at $5 trillion,\n$6 trillion, $7 trillion\nof assets under management.\nBut the robo advisors\nhave tucked in here\nat a lower cost point.\nAnd that is also true on\nthe online brokerage side.\nSo it's delivery mechanisms.\nIt's user interfaces.\nIt's service, and it's also a\ncost and, thus, price points.\nIn essence, can you do something\nbetter, quicker, cheaper?\nThat's a very simplistic\nway to think about it.\nBut any other FinTech trends?\nThere's a lot going on in\nthe capital markets that--\nRomain, you want to see if\nsomebody wants-- they just\nwant to capture a couple of the\nother trends beyond these two\non the retail side?\nROMAIN: Any volunteers?\nCome on, guys.\nNikhil, go ahead.\nThank you.\nAUDIENCE: Sorry.\nI was muted.\nI thought something\ninteresting was both Robinhood\nand Wealthfront are moving\ntowards cash management.\nSo they enter the market\nfrom the stock side of things\nand robo advisor side\nof things, but they\nseem to converge to cash\nmanagement as a next product\nto roll out.\nSo that's a big trend.\nGARY GENSLER: Yeah.\nAnd look, even\nBetterment, which we'll\ntalk about in the\nrobo advising space,\nBetterment is starting to enter\ninto the challenger bank area.\nThey're not the only ones.\nYou have TransferWise from\nthe payment side entering\ninto the challenger bank side.\nBut absolutely, some\nof these platforms\nare then spreading out.\nSo you could be robo\nadvisor first and then\nmove into something else.\nOther trends, because\nof data, we'll\nsee there's a lot of\nstartups, dozens of startups\nin the FinTech\nspace around data,\naround infrastructure, about\nwhat many investors think\nof as the back office side\nof things that are connecting\nexchanges with the public.\nThere are many startups\naround asset management\nand trying to help\nasset management out.\nAnd this would be big,\nwholesale, institutional asset\nmanagement and not\njust the retail side."], "760": [4, 310, "landscape and think\nabout this for a moment.\nWho really started\nout this whole thing?\nAnd I put some of\nthe foundation dates\nand the number of customers.\nThese are the\nfigures I could get.\nFrom time to time, I wasn't\nable to online to find a figure.\nBut Charles Schwab\nand TD Ameritrade--\nyou might think of\nthem as Ameritrade--\nboth started back\nin the early 1970s.\nActually, free internet.\nThe idea was a lower\ncost brokerage.\nBut what was happening\nin the early 1970s,\na really important part of\nthis saga is, out of the 1960s,\nthere was a movement\nthat was ultimately\ncaptured in congressional\naction in the US.\nThe US Congress got involved,\nthe Securities and Exchange\ngot involved to repeal\nfixed commission rates.\nYou see, for decades, the\nNew York Stock Exchange\nhad fixed commission rates set\nby the members of the New York\nStock Exchange.\nAnd the institutional\nworld, the larger investors,\nwanted discounts,\nwanted cheaper rates.\nAnd in the early 1970s,\nthere was this movement\nto free that up, not to have\nfixed set rates by the New York\nStock Exchange.\nAnd around this time,\nSchwab, Ameritrade\nstarted, later affiliated\nwith Toronto Dominion Bank\nand thus the TD.\nEach 50-some years later,\nabout 12 million users.\nE*TRADE starts in the\n'80s, Firstrade later.\nInteractive Brokers,\na remarkable company,\nmore on the institutional side,\nlittle less than a million\nand so forth.\nMonex bought\nTradeStation, but Monex\nfrom the '90s and even\nTradeStation earlier.\nEach of these companies were\nchipping away a little bit\nof the old concept of brokers.\nAnd there were many challenges\nin the 1990s into the noughts\nbetween Schwab and Ameritrade,\nand E*TRADE and traditional\nfirms like Merrill\nLynch and the like.\nThe asset managers themselves,\nthe big asset managers\nlike Fidelity and Vanguard\npre-date all of this.\nBut Fidelity and\nVanguard also were\nsaying, how can we, in\naddition to wealth management,\noffer online brokerage?\nAnd as we all know,\nif you have an account\nwith Fidelity or\nVanguard, or for that\nmatter with T. Rowe Price or\nother large asset managers\nin the US, at some point in\ntime in the last 20-ish years,\nsome starting in the mid\n'90s, some waiting all the way\nuntil the late\nnoughts, they started\nto say they're going to\ncompete with traditional Wall\nStreet, the Merrill\nLynches and so forth.\nAnd they were going to compete\nby offering an online ability\nto buy and sell stocks.\nBoth got into the business.\nIt's not that the big banks\ndidn't notice and everything.\nAnd some of them, even\nin the last few years,\nstarted discount\nretail packages.\nMerrill Lynch, which\nI keep mentioning,\nMerrill Lynch Edge\n2010 was a product\nafter Merrill Lynch was\nbought by Bank of America.\nAnd Bank of America is\nthinking, OK, it's post-crisis.\nThey buy Merrill Lynch.\nMerrill Lynch has this\nremarkable multiple\n1,000-person\norganization of brokers,\nbut they do Edge to be online.\nAnd even Ally\nBank, Ally Finance,\nwhich started in the\nauto lending business,\nwas that first challenger bank\nin 2009, by 2016 is saying,\nwe can get into\nthis, too, online--\n4 million members.\nBut where are we\non the startups?\nThe startups, Robinhood in\n2013 and all this package\nof startups in\nthe last few years\nreally have transformed things.\nSo what I was saying is\nthese FinTech startups,\nprimarily we think of\nRobinhood, but there's a bunch\nof others within other markets.\nLike Freetrade, and\nTastyworks, and Webull\nhave come along partly\nbecause of mobile phones,\npartly because even the Schwabs\nand Ameritrades were still\ncharging, whether it was\na few pennies a share,\nbut still charging $0.03\n$0.04, $0.05 cents a share\nand so forth.\nUser interface and cost provided\nsome opportunity to move in."], "1070": [5, 80, "companies, that E*TRADEs,\nand Ameritrades,\nand Fidelities and the like for\na moment because part of it is\nabout mobile trading.\nAnd they each-- and\nthis chart that I\nwas able to get from\nStockBrokers.com,\na comparison was just\nlike, what are the apps?\nWhat is that user interface?\nAnd this was one example.\nBut better believe that whether\nyou're Merrill Lynch Edge\nor you're Robinhood,\nyou're also thinking about,\ndo I interface well with\nan iPhone, an Android,\nand so forth, and Apple Watch?\nI have to have that\nconnectivity and that technology\nto be ready and used\non all of these.\nAnd you can run\nyour eye through,\ncan I have trading on each of\nthese products, mutual funds?\nAnd particularly\nelectronic trading\noften is around ETFs\nbut not only ETFs.\nAnd as the cryptocurrency space\ncame up, a number of them said,\nwell, can we trade\ncryptocurrencies as well?\nNot the E*TRADES\nand Ameritrades,\nbut the Robinhoods and the\ndisruptors were into that\nspace.\nSo it's just a little\nbit of a comparison\nin how some folks think.\nRecent developments\nare really important."], "1150": [6, 180, "what's called the Broker Wars.\nWhat happened start was--\nat the start was Robinhood was\neating into this, 6 million,\n7 million, 8 million members,\nnow maybe 10 million members.\nAnd as we saw the\nearlier numbers,\nSchwab and Ameritrade are\nonly at about 12 million.\nAnd as that was\nhappening, IBKR, which\nis that smaller but remarkable\ncompany, Institutional Brokers,\nin September of\n2019 said they were\ngoing to go to free brokerage\nfor some of their accounts.\nIt wasn't 100%, but\nthey were going to go.\nAnd within weeks,\nearly in October 2019,\nSchwab finally said,\nzero commission.\nNow, what's\nfascinating, I think,\nis this is the\nchallenge that we're in.\nWe're in the challenge\nof, are there\nfinancial services that will\nmove to zero top line pricing?\nAnd what we've\nfound, whether it's\nin Facebook or in many, many\nonline applications and outside\nof the financial world,\nit's a zero fee environment.\nAnd then the business model is\nearning money some other way.\nIn Facebook's case, it's about\nmarketing and advertising.\n90-plus% of their\nrevenue is really\nabout advertising\nand marketing if you\nlook at that business model,\nthat remarkable business model.\nBut it may be on the data.\nIt may be cross-selling\nand marketing.\nIt may be on the data.\nIt may be somewhere else.\nWe're going to talk about the\nrevenue model of Robinhood\nin a moment.\nBut Charles Schwab reacted.\nE*TRADE, TD Ameritrade all\nwithin one week went to zero\ncommission.\nAnd in fact, it\nled to Schwab being\nable to do the next\nthing, which was announce\nthe purchase of Ameritrade.\nWith collapsing\nrevenues in Ameritrade,\nSchwab could\nactually say, we're--\nthey made him an offer,\npurchase for $26 billion.\nMorgan Stanley wasn't\ngoing to be outdone.\nAnd early in 2020,\nMorgan Stanley,\none of the most venerable\nold-line investment banks\ndating all the way\nback to James--\nto J.P. Morgan himself, the\nindustrialist that though\nhe's departed this world\nmany decades ago has his name\non Morgan Stanley\nand JP Morgan Chase,\nMorgan Stanley buys\nE*TRADE earlier this year.\nIf you would have told the\nMorgan Stanley executives when\nE*TRADE started 30 years ago\nthat some time they would\nin their future buy E*TRADE,\nthey would have scratched\ntheir head and said, really?\nWe're going to be a retail\nonline brokerage firm?"], "1330": [7, 290, "So what's the long road?\nWhat's the long\nroad of commissions?\nThis is the-- a\nmuch earlier chart,\nbut if you look\nat this gray line,\nthis commission rates\nfrom $0.25 a share\ndown to about $0.03 cents\na share in 2008 or 2009.\nI think this chart\ncuts off around 2008.\nThis long march of\ncompetition in part\nis because of volumes\nas you can see on this,\nthat volumes were going up and\ncommissions were going down.\nSo some of it is\njust efficiency,\nbut it's also this competition\nthat was coming in from E*TRADE\nand Ameritrade on\nthe retail side.\nBut Robinhood\nentered a world that\nstill had $0.03, $0.04,\n$0.05 cents commission.\nRobinhood initially\ndid an online app\nthat was easy with a mobile\nphone to start an account.\nBut what they also did is they\nsaid, we'll do it for free.\nTheir business model from\n2013 on, we'll do it for free.\nAnd how did they do that?\nWhat's the revenue\nmodel behind that?\nAnybody want to take a\nmoment of pause, Romain?\nI will answer this question.\nI'm just saying, Romain,\nwho amongst the class\nwould think, how\ncould you be so bold?\nAs a startup venture\ncapitalist, you\nstart an entrepreneurial\neffort free online brokerage\nfrom day one.\nROMAIN: Any volunteers?\nVictor.\nAUDIENCE: I guess you can either\nmake a profit on lending money\nto traders so they\ncan purchase stock.\nAnd you can also use some\nhigh-frequency trading,\nas some people said, that's\nprobably what it's doing\nin order to before you sell,\nyou actually go through a--\ndetermine the area to\nmake a profit out of.\nGARY GENSLER: OK.\nSo Victor's raised two things.\nI'm going to focus\non the second,\nwas the relationship of\nthese mobile platforms,\nRobinhood in particularly,\nand high-frequency trading.\nWhat Robinhood knew was that a\nfeature of the capital markets\nwas that there were firms\nthat would pay for order flow.\nThey would pay a very modest\namount, maybe a penny a share,\nbut they would pay just\nto receive the order flow.\nAnd this is a feature of\nthe competitive markets,\nthe competitive\nexchange markets.\nIn the US, we have 50 to\n70 individual exchanges.\nWe think of the New\nYork Stock Exchange.\nWe think about\nNASDAQ and so forth,\nbut there are many\nother electronic markets\nwhere transactions occur.\nAnd some people call\nthem the dark markets.\nBut all of those markets\nmight pay for order flow.\nAnd then individual\ntrading shops,\nhigh-frequency trading shops,\nmight pay for order flow.\nWhat that means is they\nwant to have a first look.\nThey want to have those\norders and to route them\nthrough their algorithms and\ninto their either exchange\nengines, if it's an exchange\nthat's paying for order flow,\nor a high-frequency trading shop\nthat's paying for order flow.\nAnd the exchanges have\ndifferent fee structures\ndepending upon whether\nyou make a bid or offer\nor you take a bid or offer.\nYou will sometimes hear this\ncalled maker and taker rates.\nMaking a bid or offer, putting\na resting bid or a resting offer\ninto an exchange engine is\nmore valuable for the exchange\nbecause it brings other\norders into the exchange.\nSo what Robinhood\nfigured out was\nthey could offer the retail\npublic something for free\nbecause they entered into\ntwo or three major contracts\nwith hedge funds, with\nhigh-frequency trading\nshops saying, we will\nenter into something\nwhere we're selling you the\norder flow for a modest amount.\nI don't know the exact\namount, but let's\ncall it a penny a share inside\nthe pricing of the $0.03\nor so to $0.05 that the\nonline brokers were charging,\nbut still very valuable\nover time for Robinhood.\nAnd then bingo, 6 or 8\nmillion members later,\naccount holders later\nand a good user face,\nwe get into the Broker Wars\nwhere others drop their rates"], "1620": [8, 700, "And so then I go to this\ninteresting zero commission\nmodel chart that\ntalks about, well,\nhow could you have the cost\nof financial advice be zero?\nWell, it's because\nof everything else.\nAnd the everything else model,\nwhether it's for Morgan Stanley\nand E*TRADE, whether it's\nfor Schwab, Charles Schwab,\nor whether it's for\nRobinhood, as Victor said,\nthis is everything else that\nmight be valuable for you.\nPicking up payment\nfor order flow\nis the third one on this\nlist, but margin interest,\nmaintenance fees,\ntransaction fees,\nsaying once you have a client,\nthere's a lot of other revenues\nthat can be garnered.\nSo once Facebook has\nyour information,\nthere are other revenues\nthat Facebook can garner.\nBut in the brokerage space,\nthis is very well known.\nThis was known in the 1960s and\n1970s when the large investment\nbanks would think, if\nI have a relationship\nwith this big insurance company,\nI can earn money in other ways.\nIt's what led in part\nin the early 1970s\nto break the old\ndecades-old fixed commission\nrates because large\ninvestment banks wanted\nto discount and lower their\nrates for large institutions,\nnot for the retail public\nbut for large institutions.\nThat was 50 years\nago, but that was also\nbecause there's all\nthis revenue potential,\nas this little graphic\nsays, beneath the surface.\nRomain, questions if I can\npause a little bit, because it's\nabout the business\nmodels of brokerage\nand the business models\nof investment banking.\nROMAIN: Let's wait a few\nseconds so people have the time.\nGARY GENSLER: [INAUDIBLE] lived\nat Goldman Sachs for 18 years,\neven though that feels\nlike another era.\nROMAIN: So we have\na few questions.\nLet's take Luke and then Hassan.\nAUDIENCE: So I have\none quick question\nwhen it comes to traders\nor trading platforms.\nBanks usually make money by\nholding deposits in daily basis\nbecause that's a\nrevenue to the firm.\nIt's especially\nhard to do so in US\nwhen interest rate is near zero.\nBut in emerging markets, such\nas Korea, China, or India,\nthey basically make the revenue\nif you have somebody's money.\nAnd you can lend it out in a\nnet interest margin of positive.\nHow do platforms like\nthese, E*TRADE or Robinhood,\nmake money when they transfer\nthe money from deposit\nto their account and\ntakes two, three days,\nand they can make money out\nof it besides these hedge fund\ndeals that you have explained?\nGARY GENSLER: So\na great question.\nSo the classic what I would\ncall commercial bank model\nis exactly what Luke said.\nTo pot-- there's a net interest\nspread between the depositors'\nmoney and what you lended out.\nAnd whether you're a $1 trillion\nbank or a $100 million bank,\nit's basically that spread\nbetween the depositors' money\nand what you're lending out.\nThat model has been\naround for centuries.\nAnd as Luke said,\nit's a little bit more\nchallenging in different\ninterest rate environments,\nbut that's been there.\nThe brokerage\nbusiness traditionally\nwas making money on\ncommissions, and commissions\nwas a big part of that\nrevenue model all the way\nthrough the 1960s and '70s.\nBut there's other\npieces of it as well\nbeyond just the\ncommission of, as we\nsaw on that chart, $0.25\na share long ago or $0.03\nor $0.05 a share more recently.\nBeyond that, it's also, when\nyou buy and sell securities,\nyou-- there is what's known\nas a bid-offer spread,\nthe difference\nbetween the bid side\nand where somebody is offering.\nAnd a market maker\ncan be in the middle\nand provide liquidity\nto the market,\nget paid for taking risks.\nIt's a risk-return business.\nBut first, Luke, is\nthe bid-offer spread,\njust being in the flow.\nIn Robinhood's case,\nRobinhood said,\nwe don't have a balance sheet.\nWe're not going to pay\nfor the bid-ask spread.\nBut we will enter\ninto transactions\nwith high-frequency\ntrading shops\nand effectively give them access\nto this flow of transactions.\nAnd so that's payment\nfor order flow.\nAnd the high-frequency\ntrading shops\nare, in essence, trying to tap\ninto that bid-offer spread.\nSo that's a dominant part of it.\nIn addition, just to\nname one other, but there\nare many others--\nin addition, Charles\nSchwab and others--\nMerrill Lynch figured\nthis out decades ago.\nOnce you have that\ncustomer relationship,\nthat customer relationship will\ncome to you for other things,\nand they will come to you\nto do margin lending, which\nis a form of borrowing.\nAnd so you have maybe\nthen that customer there\nwho you can actually\nuse your balance sheet\nand lend them money, usually\nwhat's called margin lending.\nSo I'm just mentioning\ntwo of them.\nBid-ask spread, Robinhood was\nnot taking that themselves.\nThey were selling that access.\nAnd then the\nrelationship that you\ncan have when using your\nbalance sheet and lending money.\nAUDIENCE: Can you tell us a\nlittle bit about the kickbacks\nin the presentation?\nGARY GENSLER: What's that?\nAUDIENCE: Can you\ntell us a little bit\nabout the kickbacks in\nthe presentation you\nhave here in the small letters?\nGARY GENSLER: Well,\nthese are not my words.\nThese are Jason\nWenk of Altruist.\nBut in essence, there's\nso many different ways\nthat you might take a\ncustomer's order flow\nand sell access to that, or you\nmight be the front end model.\nYou could be-- I'm not saying\nRobinhood or Schwab are\ndoing this, but you can\nbe that front end model.\nAnd then somebody else will\npay you, pay the Schwab,\npay the Robinhood.\nAnd so I think what Jason\nWenk, who wrote this,\nis calling that a kickback.\nBut it's a contractual\narrangement\nto be-- have access to that\ncustomer and that order flow.\nAUDIENCE: Can I safely assume\nthat they're selling our data\nas well as Google is doing?\nGARY GENSLER: So data\nis really important,\nand data is really important\nfor multiple reasons.\nOne, the better data you\nhave, the better trading\nalgorithms you can create.\nSo part of the\npayment for order flow\nis to capture bid-ask spread.\nPart of the payment\nfor order flow\nis the data so that you\ncan build your algorithms.\nYou have more data for your\nmachine learning, absolutely.\nThere's also other\nrelevant data,\nbut fundamentally the data\nis to be a better market\nmaker and a better investor.\nI think Romain, there was\nsomebody else that still\nhad a question before I go on.\nROMAIN: Yes, Hassan.\nAUDIENCE: Hi, Professor.\nYeah.\nMy question is about\nthe bid-ask margin.\nAnd I'm just wondering,\nI mean, so for instance\nlike Robinhood, they--\nso because they\nhad many customers,\nthey could get better\ndeals, and they\ncould benefit from the flow\nof customers that they have.\nIs this how they make money?\nI'm just wondering.\nGARY GENSLER: Well, so actually,\nthe way they made money is they\nwere getting paid for that flow\nbecause their business model\nearly on, and others\nlike them now,\nsaid we will go to the investing\npublic and zero commission.\nAnd somebody else will pay us.\nA fraction of a penny\nat this point in time\nwould be enough, but\na fraction of a penny.\nThat other party\nwould pay us to,\nin essence, route those\ntransactions to the stock\nexchanges.\nAnd so one company that\ndoes pay for order flow\nis a large hedge fund\nhigh-frequency shop\nfrom Chicago called\nCitadel, which\nI don't know its\ncurrent size, but it\nused to be about a $20 billion\nhedge fund asset management\nshop and very active in\nhigh-frequency trading.\nIt's very public that it is.\nAnd so Citadel is one of those\nvendors on the other side\nof the Robinhood app.\nAnd then they find a way, as\nwe were talking with Luke.\nThey find the Citadels of\nthe world, not just Citadel.\nThey find that order flow\nis then valuable for them.\nThey're routing some of\nit to the Stock Exchange,\nand that could still\nbe worth something.\nThey're putting it\ninto their analytics.\nThey then get better\nsophisticated machine\nlearning on the analytics.\nAnd that order flow\nis also something\nthat can be very valuable to an\noperator of a dark market, one\nof these small\nelectronic markets,\nbecause you're all competing.\nIf there's 60 or 70 of\nthese small dark markets,\nthey're all competing for\nvolume and market share.\nAnd then all of the\nsudden, Robinhood has not\njust a few 100,000 customers,\nbut they have 5 million or 10\nmillion customers.\nThen they can provide\na lot of order flow\nand a lot of market coverage\nfor somebody on the other side.\nNow, as it relates to Schwab,\nSchwab and some of the earlier\nonline brokers, they got into\nthe business of collecting\nassets under management.\nThey got into the asset under\nmanagement custodial side\nof the business as well.\nThere's a lot of other revenue\nstreams, transaction fees,\naccount maintenance fees,\nand even advisory fees\nin those shops.\nI want to move on now\nto wealth management.\nI think you'll see\nmerging between the wealth\nmanagement fees and\nthe brokerage fees,\nwhich is exactly what\nwe've seen over time\nin the traditional\nbrokerage field.\nIn the traditional\nbrokerage field for decades,\na broker earned commissions.\nAnd then they started\nby the late 1990s,\nwith some support\nfrom the regulators,\nto change their revenue models.\nThe traditional\nMerrill Lynch broker\nfrom the 1930s to the 1980s\nwas a commission-based broker.\nBut by the 1990s, they started\nto charge advisory fees,\nmeaning for instance,\nmaybe 1% of the assets\nthat you left with them.\nAnd if you leave $1 million,\nif you're wealthy enough\nto have that $1\nmillion, that means\nthat they're earning $10,000\na year on your account.\nIf you obviously had\nmore, that would even\nbe better for Merrill\nLynch and worse for you\nbecause you'd be leaving\nthem a lot of money to just\nbe a custodian for\nyour account largely\nand to give you advice\nfrom time to time.\nAnd that's the set up\nfor the next discussion.\nRomain, any questions?\nROMAIN: No.\nAll good.\nGARY GENSLER: So robo\nadvisory-- and Hassan sort of"], "2320": [9, 690, "I'm going to do the\nsame sort of landscape.\nWe have the same groups,\nretail brokers, asset managers,\nand the banks.\nAdvisory work, brokerage\nadvisory was largely,\nfor many decades, the\ndomain of investment banks\nand broker dealers, Merrill\nLynch, Smith Barney,\nPaine Webber, many, many\ncompanies across the land,\nsmall and large.\nAnd they were a\ncommission-based business.\nBy the 1990s, as\nI mentioned, they\nstarted to move to a financial\nadvisory commission number.\nAnd I can't remember exactly\nwhat year it was in the 1990s.\nEven the Securities\nand Exchange Commission\nchanged some rules to\nfacilitate some of that.\nComing from the other side,\nthe big asset managers\nmanaging pension money and\nmanaging big pools of money\nthrough mutual\nfunds also started\nto get into the\nretail advisory space.\nAnd thirdly, you\nhad the brokers,\nthe Schwabs and so forth.\nNow, I've put some names here\nlike Charles Schwab Intelligent\nPortfolios, which is a more\nrecent rollout, that branding,\nIntelligent Portfolios\nor TD America's\nAmeritrade's\nEssential Portfolios,\nmore recent roll out for them.\nAnd they've been\nreacting to this crowd,\nthis remarkable,\nentrepreneurial, mobile app\nrobo advisors.\nAnd these companies span the\nglobe in Europe, US, and Asia.\nBut what Betterment, or\nNutmeg, and others are doing\nis they're saying, we can\ngive more financial inclusion,\nand we can do it in a better\nuser interface and a lower cost\nstructure.\nBy and large, the\nasset management fees\nfor an account in the\ntraditional brokerage\nenvironment was\nhovering close to 1%.\nThere was some\nprice compression.\nSome of it was coming down\ninto the 3/4 of 1% to 1% area.\nThat means, again, if you were\nfortunate enough to have--\nlet's just say that\nyou had $500,000,\nand you were able to have\nsomebody invest it for you\nor advise you.\n1% of $500,000 is $5,000.\nThat's $400 a month that\nyou were paying, in essence,\nfor somebody to give\nyou occasional advice\nand be your custodian for\nyour electronic securities,\nbecause everything was\ndigital by this point in time.\nIt was no longer those\nearlier days where\nyou had physical certificates.\nThis group came\nalong and said, maybe\nwe could do it at a different\nprice point, a better user\ninterface, maybe better\nanalytics and service,\ngenerally somewhere between 30\nto 50 basis points or a quarter\nto a half a percent.\nThat same $500,000, if you\nwere to have that $500,000,\nall of the sudden doesn't cost\nyou $5,000 or $4,000 a year,\nbut it's costing maybe $1,500\na year or $100 a month.\nNow, you don't get a bill\nfor the $100 a month.\nIt just comes out each\nmonth out of your account,\nand it's charged\nas a fee per se.\nBut there's generally a\ndifferent price point.\nWe haven't gone all the way that\nwe went with online brokerage,\nto mobile brokerage, to\nzero accounts, zero fees.\nBut one of the great pressures\nthat have happened here\nas well, which is off this\npage, is asset management fees\nhave been coming down\nas well and particularly\naround a product called\nexchange traded funds.\nAnd to understand the\nfield of robo advisors,\nI just want to mention\nsomething about exchange traded\nfunds, which is an\ninvention of the late 1990s.\nThat was a FinTech of its\ntime that somebody came up\nwith the idea, I can\nhave a mutual fund.\nI can have a mutual fund that\ninvests in the entire market,\nand I can do it at a low cost.\nAnd I can package it\nthrough a security.\nSo let me unpack that.\nThe first innovation was an\ninnovation of the early 1970s.\nJack Bogle, who was the key\ninnovator behind Vanguard,\nsaid, wouldn't it be great if\nwe gave America at the time\na product they can invest\nin the whole stock market\na little bit of each company?\nAnd we're not going\nto manage it for them.\nWe're just going to\nalgorithmically, arithmetically\npick a little bit\nof every stock.\nAnd it was called an index fund.\nWe take it for\ngranted, but that was\nan innovation, a remarkable\ninnovation of the 1970s.\nEverybody could have a piece of\nthe stock market at a low cost.\nAnd to this day, Vanguard is\nstill not a publicly traded\nfor-profit company.\nIt's a mutual company.\nVanguard is held and\nowned by its mutual funds\nthat are held and owned by us\nif we're a part of Vanguard.\nThat innovation then\nled to an innovation\nin the 1990s that\nsaid, what can we\ndo to make this\neven more efficient?\nWhat if we take an\nindex mutual fund\nand take the interest\nin the mutual funds\nand make those securities?\nTook a little change\nin some regulations,\nbut all of the sudden, we had\nthis thing called exchange\ntraded funds, these\nlow-cost ways to participate\nin the stock market,\nthe bond market,\nsome in the gold\nand silver markets--\nexchange traded funds.\nAll of these robo advisors\nin their packaging have said,\nwe can get you into\nthis and get you out\nof this, into this market\nor out of this market,\nand use exchange traded funds.\nThe second big innovation\nfor robo advisors, of course,\nis everything we talked about\nout of artificial intelligence\nand natural language\nprogramming, processing,\nthe ability to take voice or\ntake digital and transfer that\ninto machine language, computer\nlanguage, and the reverse.\nSo robo advisors came\nalong at a point in time\nwhere you could basically\nautomate us humans a bit,\nnot entirely, but\nwe could step back.\nHumans step back, and\nrobo advice goes in.\nAnd you could do it\na lower price point.\nAnd the third\ninnovation was basically\nsome simple analytics--\nnot machine learning, but\nsimple analytics on portfolio\nand asset allocation.\nSome of it's related to,\nif you're in your 20s\nand you're saving\nfor retirement,\nyou could take more risk.\nYou could have a higher equity\nshare versus a bond share.\nIf you're in your 60s, and\nyou're about to retire,\nyou should be more stable,\na little less risk, maybe\nmore bonds and less equities.\nSome of it's that\nsimple, but they were\nable to basically take that.\nAnd so the Betterment\nstarted, and they\ncould find really readily\navailable software\nfor asset allocation.\nThey could use products\nlike exchange traded funds.\nMobile phones were\naround already.\nSo they had a good platform.\nAnd they say, all right,\nwe'll go to a lower fee point.\nAnd all of the sudden, we start\nto see a real change of things.\nQuestions, Romain?\nROMAIN: While we wait for\nquestions on this topic,\nwe have a question in the chat\nabout Robinhood's business\nmodel from George.\nDo you see Robinhood\nand other startups\nstarting their own\nhigh-frequency trading\noperations instead of\nselling the order flows?\nAnd then Devin asks\nwhether maybe Citadel\nor any other hedge fund should\njust buy Robinhood outright.\nGARY GENSLER: These are\ntwo really great questions\nabout the future.\nI think that in both ways\nwill the front end platform--\nand that's really, in a sense,\nRobinhood and, even in this\nrobo advisor space, the\nBetterments of the world--\nis a front end user\ninterface platform\nthat tend not to\nhave balance sheets.\nAnd they tend to let somebody\nelse handle that capital\nmarkets risk behind it.\nBut the question here is,\ndo I see the front end\nbuilding balance sheet and\nmoving into the capital market\nside?\nAnd do I see the capital\nmarket side, the balance sheet\nrisk taking, moving\ninto the front end side?\nAnd we don't know,\nbut history tells\nus that tends to\nhappen at some point,\nthat there's some\nsort of what you might\ncall vertical integration.\nAnd if you really think about\nthese slices on this page,\nthe JP Morgan building you\ninvest in 2018 or Merrill Edge\nin an earlier time--\nand if I go back to\nthe brokerage side,\nthey're named\nproducts there, too--\nthat's balance sheet\ncoupled with front end.\nThat's the fully\nintegrated model.\nBut then if you look at the\nasset managers, the asset\nmanagers, the\nBlackRocks of the world\nare not actually\nacting as a principal.\nThey're acting as an advisor,\na pure advisor, a pure agency\nbusiness.\nSo one of the things is, do you\njust want to stay as an agent,\nor do you actually\nwant to invest\nyour capital in the markets?\nAnd that big business\ndecision separates\nsome of the asset managers\nand then, as you mentioned,\nthe high-frequency traders.\nI think that if Robinhood\nis going to be bought,\nit could be bought by\nhigh-frequency trading shop.\nBut the challenge\nthere is, will they\nstill get as big\na customer base,\nI mean 10 million customers?\nOr is Robinhood more valuable\nfor one of the large banks\nto buy or one of the\nlarge asset managers?\nI think if you look out\nthree to five years,\nit's quite likely that Robinhood\ngets merged up into something,\nas you saw Morgan Stanley\nbuying E*TRADE as well.\nAnother question?\nROMAIN: Yes.\nLet's go with Camillo.\nGARY GENSLER: And then I'm going\nto do a few more slides here\non robo advisors.\nAUDIENCE: Hi, Gary.\nI wonder why platforms such\nas Acorns and Betterment\nthat you were just talking about\nhave a mixed business model,\nbecause in one way, they are\na robo advisor business model.\nBut then they have savings\nand checking accounts.\nGARY GENSLER: Correct.\nAUDIENCE: They're stepping\na foot into a banking model.\nWhat's the reason to merge\nthe two spaces into one?\nGARY GENSLER: I think because\nthey have the front end"], "3010": [10, 70, "And this helps set something up.\nThis is a chart on users.\nAnd it's got some\npredictions here.\nWe don't know if these\npredictions will hold.\nBut if you see the\nuse of robo advisors,\nit's just getting\nmuch more comfortable\nthat folks are being--\nand this, I believe,\nalso includes the robo\nadvisors at the big shops\nas well as the startups.\nBut just as if you have\nthat user interface--\nand remember we talked\nabout challenger banks\nas well, Camillo,\nthe challenger banks\nlast session, a lot of\nit's about trust as well.\nOnce you have that\nuser interface,\nthere's a certain trust and,\nfrankly, stickiness to it.\nSo if Betterment, which is\nlooking to become a challenger\nbank, can use that\ncustomer relationship,\nthen you can build the platform.\nAnd back to the\neconomics of platforms,\nthe economics of platforms\nis as you layer activities\non top of a platform, and if\nyou can grow your user base,\nyou get more data, you\nget more centrality."], "3080": [11, 60, "this many advisory platforms.\nAnd in fact, in the blue,\nthe advisory platforms,\nI picked the ones\nthat are large.\nThere's 50 to 100 others\nthat I haven't listed.\nSo there is going\nto be consolidation.\nAs sure as we're\nhere at this moment,\nthere's going to be\nconsolidation in this space.\nAnd so they're trying to build\nclassic platform economics,\nbuild activities,\nbuild user bases.\nAnd this is assets\nunder management,\nthe same website behind this.\nBut as of a few days ago, just\na sense of, what are the assets?\nThis is in billions.\nSo in 2020, $1.2 trillion\nof assets under management\nsomehow associated\nwith robo advisors.\nSo even a 1/4%\nfee on this starts"], "3140": [12, 300, "Possible evolution, I\nlike thinking about,\nwhere could this\ngo in the future?\nWhere did robo advising start,\nall the way on the left?\nIt's just an online\nquestionnaire\nabout asset allocation largely,\nand an online questionnaire,\na mobile questionnaire about\nproducts and risk and how--\nand then usually\na list of exchange\ntraded funds, some bonds.\nSo simple but very accessible,\nbroadening financial inclusion\nfor lower rates.\nAnd it helps a lot of\npeople, a lot of investors\nsleep well at night.\nIt lowers their uncertainty.\nI'm getting some good advice\nabout asset allocation,\nsome risks, some life events.\nBut could move it move further?\nThat's the question.\nCan it move further?\nAnd exactly like Camillo said\nand Luke's earlier question\nabout other revenues, can robo\nadvisors-- like Betterment\nsay, well, we'll actually\nbe the fund manager.\nWe'll start to actually\nmanage the funds\nrather than just doing\nthese low-cost ETFs.\nAnd maybe we'll\nstart to actually do\nsomething more\nwith regard to risk\nbased portfolio allocation.\nMaybe we'll start in\nthis third column,\ndo a little bit of algorithms.\nMaybe, in fact, we'll\nstart to do trading and be\nprincipals rather than just\nan agent and an advisor\nand the like.\nSo there's going to be more\nsophisticated algorithmic AI\nor machine learning.\nBut I don't think it's going to\nbe highly sophisticated machine\nlearning because there's\na certain commoditization\nabout the advice.\nBut it is quite possible\nas we move forward\nthat somebody will figure\nout what risk I should\ntake versus somebody else.\nAndrew Lo, a faculty\nmember at MIT,\nthinks that you can\ntake machine learning\nand embed it in even an\nindex fund, that you could\nhave inside of an index fund--\nwhat Andy talks about is\ncalled \"the freakout factor,\"\nthat we all have\ndifferent risk profiles.\nWhen the stock market\ngoes out, down,\nhow likely are we to, quote, as\nhe says, \"freak out\" and want\nto sell?\nAnd that we could, based upon\nother aspects of our lives,\nput that into a\nmachine learning model\nand have it automatically\nadjust up and down.\nQuestions before I think\nI'm going to go to the--\nbroadly the capital\nmarkets piece?\nROMAIN: We have a question.\nGARY GENSLER: So we've\nsort of covered--\nI'm pausing here for a\nsecond, but we've sort of\ncovered the online\nbrokerage, robo advisor,\nthose two big pieces as captured\nby Robinhood and Betterment,\nmight be the two companies\nthat are the leads of the pack,\nbut they're not alone.\nAnd in the wealth\nmanagement side,\nit's much more evenly split,\nwhereas in the mobile side,\nin the mobile brokerage\nside, Robinhood\nseemed to really sort of\npunched high and done well.\nROMAIN: The only\nquestion we have here\nis from the chat from Luke.\nWhat kind of US\nregulation is [INAUDIBLE]\nthe likes of Robinhood\nto expand globally\nor to attract\ncapital from abroad?\nGARY GENSLER: Well, this\nis a highly regulated\nspace in both the advisory\nside and the brokerage side.\nAnd Robinhood would certainly\nneed to be aware of that\nand register appropriately as\na broker dealer here in the US.\nAnd then on the asset\nmanagement side,\nthere's a little bit different\nregulation but also regulated\nhere.\nAttracting capital\nfrom overseas,\nif the capital is just\ninvesting in Robinhood,\nin one of their venture\nrounds, BCD rounds,\nbecause these are probably\nprivate placements largely\nspeaking, other than\nthe usual regulations\naround sanctions and\nanti-money laundering,\nit'd be straightforward.\nIf it's actually customers\nusing the platform,\nthen a Robinhood would have\nto be aware of the regulations\nin that jurisdiction, whether\nit's the regulations in Europe\nor in your home country,\nLuke,-- in Korea, that they'd--\nthose customer-facing\napplications, Robinhood Korea\nwould have to think, do they\nregister as a broker dealer\nin Korea or Japan and the\nlike, as they are, in fact,\njust a mobile application\nfor a traditional investment\nbrokerage firm?"], "3440": [13, 80, "So again trying to\ncapture capital markets.\nCapital markets is a\nvast array of activities\nfrom accessing capital to\ntrading platforms and the like.\nAnd this slide\nfrom McKinsey just\ncaptures an earlier\nstage of, where\nis FinTech in each of these?\nAnd I'm not going to go\nthrough each of these buckets,\nbut part of why I have this is\nit's so many little buckets.\nWe talked about two\non the retail side.\nThere are crowdfunding\nplatforms, literally platforms\nthat help companies raise money.\nThere's trade execution, and\nI'm going to talk about a couple\nin a minute,\ndecentralized trading\nplatforms like cryptocurrencies,\nbut also centralized trading\nplatforms and cryptocurrencies.\nBut even in the last\nfew years, a firm\ncalled IEX is a startup\nin trade execution.\nIt's a new trading platform.\nThere's post-trade services.\nThere's a lot of\ninfrastructure and operations.\nThe capital markets are a vast\nmulti-trillion dollar business\nglobally in terms of revenues."], "3520": [14, 100, "in these next couple of slides.\nYou can see, I picked\nsome dozen or so firms\nthat were just ones I kind\nof like to watch and follow.\nWe can take any questions\nabout each of these,\nbut there are a number of them\nin the wealth management space.\nAnd one of the things in wealth\nmanagement we talked about,\nlike Betterment, is\nfacing the retail public.\nBut there are startups that are\nin the wealth management space\nfacing financial advisors.\nThese tens of thousands\nof financial advisors\nwant better software.\nAnd Addepar and a\nnumber of others\nare actually platforms for\nthe financial advisors,\nthat financial advisor that's\ntrying to build a business\nwants software and access\nto the capital market.\nSo it's an interface\nbetween the two.\nThere's a bunch that are in the\narea of collateral management\nand infrastructure, CloudMargin.\nLiterally, collateral\nmanagement means the collateral\nthat you're moving\non derivatives\nin the institutional\nmarket or collateral\nthat you're moving even\nas it relates to loans.\nAnd why not start\na platform that\nmight be a little better\nfor collateral management\nand take some of the back\noffice cost out of it?\nAnd not to be outdone,\nyou could have\ndigital fixed-income brokers\nas well as equity brokers.\nWhat we were talking about\nearlier was the stock market\nand this company\ncalled Elephant."], "3620": [15, 100, "It's to be a competitive\nstock market to NASDAQ,\nNew York Stock Exchange\nstarted by a bunch of buy side\ninstitutions, for instance.\nAnd sometimes,\nit's just research.\nPitchBook and others\nlike PitchBook\nput together a\nremarkable data base\non the financial business of\nventure capital, for instance.\nSo it could be a lot\nof different spaces.\nBack to thinking about the\ndifferent aspects of capital\nmarkets, crowdfunding\nplatforms, trade execution,\nthe post-trade side of it.\nI don't do this to be like a\nfull course on capital markets,\nbut it's to open your\nthinking to it's not just\nthe retail interface.\nIt's not just using a mobile\nphone, good data, good user\ndelivery, and lower cost.\nAnd that's really the\nRobinhood, Betterment side.\nIt's also a lot of taking\nthe paper flows out\nof it, old processes\nout of the back office,\nand trying to provide a\nservice to the capital\nmarkets in a better way.\nRomain, any--\nROMAIN: Any hands raised?\nAnyone has a question\non this topic?\nNo.\nI think we can move on.\nGARY GENSLER: Let me just\nclose out crypto markets a bit.\nAnd some of you take the\ncrypto finance course,"], "3720": [16, 560, "But let me just say, one\nthing that's interesting\nis this crypto\nmarket came along.\nIs there a question here?\nROMAIN: Luke has\nhis hand raised.\nGARY GENSLER: Let me hold Luke\nbecause he's had a lot here.\nSo let me just say\nsomething on crypto markets,\nand then we'll definitely\ntake Luke's question.\nBut the crypto markets came\nalong about a dozen years ago.\nAnd by an early stage of these\nmarkets, somebody said, how\ncan you buy and sell Bitcoin?\nAnd they created exchanges,\na new form of exchange,\nnot for equities,\nnot for bonds, not\nfor foreign currencies\nor Fiat currencies,\nbut cryptocurrencies.\nAnd these exchanges act\nas agents matching buyers\nand sellers like\ntraditional exchanges,\nbut they also act\nas market makers.\nWe talked earlier about\ncapturing bid-ask spread.\nThese exchanges could also\nbuy and sell from customers.\nNot all of them\ndo, but they could.\nTraditional exchanges did not.\nAnd they also acted as a\ncustody and held your funds.\nAnd even to this day, if you\ntrade on a crypto exchange,\nyou're moving your\nasset through the use\nof what's called a private key.\nBut you're moving your asset\nto the crypto exchange,\nand they're the custody.\nThey're the custodian.\nThe public has direct access.\nAnd this is a very\ndifferent model\nthan traditional exchanges.\nAnd the question\nwill be, will this\ncome to traditional markets?\nAnd that's why I wanted\nto focus on this minute.\nIn traditional markets built\nupon a business model that's\nmultiple centuries\nold, you and I\nare not members directly of\nthe New York Stock Exchange.\nWe have to go through somebody\nto get to the New York Stock\nExchange.\nThat's called a broker.\nIt's called a member of the\nNew York Stock Exchange,\nor the London Stock Exchange,\nor the Shanghai Stock Exchange.\nBut in these markets,\nin these crypto markets\neverybody can access\ndirectly the markets.\nThe markets actually,\ninterestingly,\nhave to have a much more robust\nAPI for the retail public.\nThe New York Stock Exchange\nand London Stock Exchange\nhave to have a robust API,\napplication program interface,\nfor institutions.\nAnd it has to be very high\nvolume, very resilient.\nBut it can be\nlimited to hundreds\nor, at most, a couple\nthousands of users\neven if the volumes are high.\nThese exchanges have to be\nopen to millions of people\nfrom their home laptops\nand mobile phones--\na very different architecture\nwhere it's disintermediated\nthe broker dealers.\nAnd the question I have, which\nis unanswerable right now,\nwill this be something\nmoving forward?\nWill we see a\ndirect access model\nat any exchange\naround the globe,\nor will we stay in the\nintermediated access?\nThere's a lot of\nregulatory reasons\nwe'd stay in the\nintermediated access.\nThere's some competitive\nreasons brokers wouldn't want\nto have folks going directly.\nBut on the other\nhand, the technology\nnow exists that you\ncould go directly.\nAnd so these markets, by the\nway, are not well regulated.\nAnd they're rife with fraud,\nand scams, and manipulation.\nSo I just want to mention that.\nI see a few hands in\naddition to Luke's hand.\nSo maybe we should pause.\nROMAIN: Yes, Carlos?\nGARY GENSLER: And we\nhave to get Luke's, too.\nBut, Carlos, all right.\nAUDIENCE: So what do\nyou think would happen\nif the big banks started holding\nmore crypto on their balance\nsheets, right?\nIf they start acting as market\nmakers in crypto markets,\nthen would it-- for example,\nunder current regulation,\nwould this asset go\nunder Dodd-Frank as well\nand therefore limit\nproprietary trading,\nor do you think it\nwould be different?\nGARY GENSLER: So there's a\nlot of questions in there.\nThe large banks\naround the globe today\nhave not been active\nin this asset class.\nThe asset class is\nabout $225 billion\nas of this morning,\nwhich is small.\nThe worldwide capital markets\nare between $300 trillion\nand $400 trillion when you add\nequities and bonds worldwide\nand debt.\nSo this is quite\nsmall in comparison.\nBut for regulatory reasons and\nfor customer interest reasons,\nthe large banks\nhaven't really gone in.\nIf they were to get in, to\nanswer answer your question\non the regulatory\nside, yes, it would\nbe just like any other asset\nthey have, any commodity.\nSo if you hold\nBitcoin, you might\nthink if you're JP Morgan,\nI'm now holding it.\nI'm Barclays bank.\nI'm now holding it.\nWhat regulations?\nIf it's Bitcoin, it would be\nvery similar to the regulations\naround holding gold or silver.\nMaybe you would hold gold or\nsilver futures or contracts,\nbut holding gold, silver.\nAnd to the extent\nthat there was a--\nyou mentioned Dodd-Frank.\nIf there were any rules and\nregulations out of Dodd-Frank\nthat were generally applicable\nto trading accounts,\nit would be applicable to\nthese trading accounts.\nThe one big challenge for\nbig institutions is custody.\nCustody has been a challenge.\nAnd what's interesting is\nFidelity, one of the largest\nasset managers in\nthe world, started\nsomething called Fidelity\nDigital Asset holding--\nI believe that's the name--\nwhere they are providing\na custody solution.\nCoinbase, which is a\nlarge crypto exchange,\nhas a custody solution.\nThe owner of the New York\nStock Exchange Intercontinental\nExchange started\nBakkt, B-A-K-K-T.\nBakkt is trading crypto markets\nbut also providing a custody\nsolution.\nAnd why I'm focusing\non custody is\none of the challenges in\nthis small asset class is\nhow to hold the digital asset.\nIn the traditional\nmarkets, there\nare centralized\norganizations that\noperate as\nclearinghouses but also\nas the ultimate\ndigital custodian.\nIn the US, it's called DTCC.\nAnd other countries\nhave different names.\nBut how do you make sure that,\nin essence, the cryptocurrency\nisn't stolen?\nThese crypto exchanges have had\nlots of stolen cryptocurrency\nbecause once you\nsteal what's called\nthe private key,\neffectively the

of taking\nbut [INAUDIBLE]\nhave the opportunity\nto take next semester\nor next year.\nMy question is then, is\nthat because of the security\nthat Robinhood does\nnot implement customers\nthe option to buy US\nequity with Bitcoin\noverseas, because\nthey would allow\nthem to jump over its\nrespective nations\nethics regulations, i.e.\nChinese customers\nor Korean customers\nwho want to invest in ONG--\nGARY GENSLER: I--\nAUDIENCE: --buy low,\nsell high with Bitcoin?\nGARY GENSLER: Yes, Luke.\nI'm going to answer briefly.\nI think the regulation for any\none platform like Robinhood\naround cryptocurrencies\nis a bit challenging\nbecause in many\njurisdictions, we have not\ngotten to a place\nwhere you can feel\nconfident we have a\nrobust investor protection\nregime on cryptocurrency.\nAnd in fact, in\nmost jurisdictions,\nit's pretty shaky.\nIt's pretty still undeveloped.\nI'm talking about\ninvestor protection.\nSo Robinhood may\nhave made a choice,\nlook, if you're going\nto trade, you're\ngoing to trade Fiat currency\nversus buying and selling\nstocks.\nAnd that would be an\nappropriate business decision\nthat they made until\nthere is a much more\nrobust and satisfactory\nboth investor protection\nand also guarding\nagainst illicit activity.\nCryptocurrency started\nand emanated out\nof a little bit of an off\nthe grid cypherpunk movement.\nAnd I use the word accurately.\nCypherpunk was a mailing\nlist that Satoshi Nakamoto\nuploaded that eight-page\npaper on 12 years ago.\nAnd though you can track\nBitcoin transactions,\na lot of use of Bitcoin\nand other cryptocurrencies\nhas been to avoid the\ncensorship and the watchful eyes\nof the official sector.\nAnd so I would imagine--\nI've not talked to\nRobinhood-- that they\nwould be aware of that.\nAnd they would just feel\nas both a legal matter\nand for reputational\nreasons, better not\nto go there unless\nthere is a more"], "4280": [17, 130, "ROMAIN: And Nadia had\nher hand up for a while.\nGARY GENSLER: [INAUDIBLE]\nROMAIN: Nadia?\nAUDIENCE: Yeah.\nI actually have two questions\non wealth management FinTech.\nSo the first\nquestion, what do you\nthink more important for wealth\nmanagement FinTech to grow?\nIs it the inclusion\npart, meaning\nlike low minimum deposit,\nor the user experience part?\nThat is for the first questions.\nAnd for the second\nquestion, given the growth\nof past management\nfeature like Wealthfront,\ndo you think now customers\nprefer a simpler product rather\nthan more complicated product?\nGARY GENSLER: So there's\na lot there, Nadia.\nI'm not sure what--\nbut I think that the Betterments\nand the robo advisors,\nI can't separate the two.\nWhen you're saying, is it\nmore about user interface,\nis it more about pricing, maybe\nsomebody better than I could,\nbut I think it's about both.\nI really do think that.\nI think that they have provided\na lower price point, which\nis really important.\nBut if it were only that,\nif somebody had just\nput out an advertisement,\nI'm going to give you\nwealth advice for a\nquarter of a point,\nI don't think you could\nhave gotten adoption.\nI think you had to have\nthat user interface.\nAnd I think the two of them\ntogether are really important.\nSo it's not just doing\nsomething cheaper,\nbecause a lot of people\ncould say, listen,\nI'll give you wealth advice\nfor a quarter of a point.\nI think the user experience--\nthese are very private matters.\nSometimes it's just\nfrankly a little easier.\nIt's interesting to just\ngo to a drop down menu,\nanswer some questions, feel\nthat I'm getting the advice,\nfeel that I'm, yes,\ngetting low-cost ETFs\nand low-cost advisory fees.\nBut I think the user\nexperience goes hand in hand.\nAnd I can't easily\nseparate them.\nLet me just try to wrap up.\nAnd then, Nadia, remind me the\nsecond half of your question\nas I wrap up, because I\nwant to make a-- we only\nhave about 3 minutes."], "4410": [18, 40, "There's a bunch of crypto\nlending and borrowing.\nAnd why I raise this\nis this market, just\nlike the capital markets,\nis starting to say,\ncan I lend to crypto?\nCan I borrow crypto?\nAnd why would you do that?\nSame reason in the\ncapital markets.\nYou lend and borrow\nstock sometimes\nbecause you want to buy\nthe stocks on margin.\nOr sometimes you\nlend it because you\nneed to borrow against your\nassets to do something else.\nSo these markets are\ndeveloping that way,\nbut the thing that\nI wanted to mention\nwas this question of\ndecentralized finance"], "4450": [19, 130, "Centralized\ntraditional finance--\nthis is a slide that I created\nin the last eight months--\nhas proprietary software,\ncentral clearing,\nall the attributes\nthat I list here.\nThe question is, is there\na market just like we\ntalked about in lending for peer\nto peer decentralized finance?\nAnd what we found in\nLendingClub and other companies,\nthey really haven't\nstayed decentralized.\nThey started with this\nconcept that we'll\nbe peers lending to peers.\nAnd then what we found is\nthey've become more marketplace\nplatforms.\nAnd platform

again.\nIt's a business\nconcept that I just\nwant to prepare you for,\ndecentralized finance\nversus traditional\nfinance, usually used\nin the context of\nblockchain technology.\nAnd the advocates say blockchain\ntechnology facilitates--\nwe can get rid of the big banks.\nThat is what they might say.\nThat's what Satoshi\nNakamoto wrote\nin some of the early emails\nand so forth, that we\ncan disintermediate both\nbanks and central banks\naround cryptocurrency\nand the like.\nThat's the dream.\nBut the question is\nwhether network economics--\nwhether there's a reason in\ncapital markets and finance\nthat you have a hub and\nspoke approach rather\nthan a decentralized approach.\nWhen I say \"hub and spoke,\"\nthe New York Stock Exchange\nor London Stock Exchange is\nin the middle of the market,\nthat the banks, back to\nLuke's earlier question,\nare sitting there collecting\na net interest margin\nand why LendingClub is moved\ninto a marketplace platform\nrather than that peer to

there are\nDeFi platforms,\ndecentralized finance\nwhere you can peer to peer\nuse a crypto exchange.\nBinance, IDEX, Uniswap,\nothers basically say,\nwe're not going to have a\ncentral exchange or, more\ntechnically, a central\nlimit order book.\nBut Nadia and I could trade.\nAnd later Nadia could\ntrade with Luke,\nand Camillo could trade\nwith somebody else,\nbut it's not all centralized.\nAnd similarly,\nthere's platforms--\nMaker DAO, and\nCompound, and Synthetix\nare the three big ones--\nthat are trying to do that on\ncrypto lending and borrowing.\nThere is even prediction\nmarking markets\nthat are trying to say Nadia can\ntrade with Luke and make a bet.\nNow, the regulatory environment\nfor these prediction markets\nis highly challenged,\nand they might\nbe doing things that are\nnot strictly within the law.\nBut these decentralized\nmarkets are very small.\nNone of these projects\nare really big.\nBut some of these projects\nhave a few billion\ndollars in their\ncrypto
