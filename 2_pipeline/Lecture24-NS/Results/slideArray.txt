of a neuron is given by a linear filter acting on the stimulus.

Spike trains are often quite variable. The precise pattern of
spikes on each presentation of a stimulus is different.

rary

 

Imagine a random process that produces spikes at an average rate of spikes
per second during the stimulus presentation.

Break up the spike train into small time bins of some duration At. Each spike is
generated independently of other spikes and with equal probability in each bin. then
we can write the probability that a spike occurs in any bin as

If At is small enough that most of the bins have zero spikes, we can write the
probability that a spike occurs in any bin as: Ll: At

The probability that no spike occurs in the bin is: ] — LL: At

ENDELEMENTConvolution

* We have discussed the idea of convolution

y(t)= i dt G(t)x(t —T)

—0o

— To model the response of membrane potential to synaptic input
— To model the response of neurons to a time-dependent stimulus

— To implement a low-pass or high-pass filter

* In general, convolution allows us to model the output of a system as
a linear filter acting on its input.

* Let's start with an even function that is periodic with a period T

same period T and amplitude.
