1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
ok so let's let's go and get started till what is

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:30,000
is no complication no science used to be a very descriptive field where you would describe

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
the different kinds of Norris who here is seen the famous pictures the old pictures of the Golgi stained neuronz

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:50,000
different types of Lawrence describing what things look like in the brain and what parts of the brain are important for

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:00,000
bar behaviour based on the Asian studies it used to be extremely descriptive but things are changing in their sights and have to change dramatically over the past few

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:10,000
really neuroscience now is about understanding the brain how the brain works how the brain produces behaviour and really trying to

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:20,000
engineering level descriptions of brain systems and brain circuits and norah's and ion channels in all the components of Lawrence that make the brain

8
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:30,000
cancel for example the level of description that my lab works at in that I'm most excited

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,000
r s sort of understanding how the circuits how norms are put together to make neural circuits that implement behaviours or or

10
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:50,000
are to produce object recognition figure from Jim dicarlo who is our department head basically Circuit

11
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:00,000
scription of how the brain goes from a visual stimulus to a recognition of white that object is in the in the stimulus

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:10,000
time that there's been a big push toward understanding or generating for engineering level descriptions of brands and circuits and components

13
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:20,000
there is also been tremendous advances in the the technologies that we can use to recorder on throat so there are

14
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:30,000
imaging systems in microscopes that can image thousands of nor and simultaneously this says an example

15
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:40,000
have a movie recorded in a in a wake baby Mouse that's basically dreaming ok and I mean

16
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:50,000
what does looks like so this is a mouse that has a fluorescent protein that's sensitive to normal activity and so when you're is in a part of

17
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:00,000
become a activate they become fluorescent and light up and so here is it top surface of the mouses brain and you can see this

18
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:10,000
continuous activity sort of flickering around is this mouse is just sort of dreaming and thinking about whatever it's thinking about

19
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:20,000
so that one of the key challenges is to take images like this that had that represent the activity of thousands of narancia millions of

20
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:30,000
and figure out how to relate that to the circuit models that are being developed so here is another example so there are these

21
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:40,000
probs where is a basically silicone probs that have thousands of little sensors on them and and a computer here that basically read out the

22
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:50,000
activities are pulp nopixel so basically electrodes there can again record from thousands of neuron's simultaneously in there quite long

23
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:00,000
record throughout the whole brain essentially all at once this very high dimensional dataset

24
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:10,000
how do you relate that to the circuit models that you are developing it's a one of the key challenges in neuroscience is to

25
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:20,000
very large datasets that you know that look like this that just going to look like a mass and figure out what's going on underneath their ok turns out

26
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:30,000
people are discovering that you know why you might be recording from tens of thousands of nora's and it looks really messy but there's some underlying very simple structure

27
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:40,000
underneath of there but you can see it when you just looked at big collections of ne on site that's ok so I saw the

28
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:50,000
here is really to figure out how to not only just make those models by test them by taking data and relating the patterns of activity that you see

29
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:00,000
very high dimensional datasets do dimensionality reduction compress that dated down into a simple representation and then relate it

30
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:10,000
models that you developed one of the things were going to try to do in this class is 2

31
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:20,000
why these techniques of making models of meringues and circuits together with mathematical tools for analysing data

32
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:30,000
context of looking at animal behaviours for example in my lab we study how how song

33
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:40,000
sing how they learn to produce the vocalisations song Bros learn by imitating her parents that listen to their parents

34
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:50,000
ok

35
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Venice

36
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I was having a girl

37
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:20,000
ok so this is just a set up showing how we can record from neuronz in

38
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Wilder singing and figure out how those circuits work to produce the song by this is at little Michael drive that we built it's it's motorised so that we can move these

39
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:40,000
what's around independently in the brain and record from Lauren's without the animal knowing that were like moving the electrodes around and looking for neuron's then the birds

40
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Sun guitar really cool they listen to the parents they store a memory of what their parents thing and then they begin babbling and they practice over and over again until they can learn it

41
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:00,000
the of this song is a bird that singing with the microdrive on it's head and you can hear them run in the background sorry it's it's not over the loudspeaker Hill

42
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:10,000
you can everyone here that so so we can record from nose while the bird is singing look at the activity in this in this

43
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:20,000
and try to figure out how that network actually works to produce the song and also we can recording very young birds and figure out how the song is actually

44
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:30,000
and there is an example of generating action potentials which is the the basic

45
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:40,000
communication in the brain and ok and then we belt the we try to build

46
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:50,000
how old is in figure out how that how that thing actually works to produce and learn the song

47
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:00,000
tell tell these computational approaches that I'm talking about it or not just important for dissenting brain circuits related to behaviour

48
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:10,000
go the same kinds of approaches the same kind of dimensionality reduction techniques for gonna learn are also useful in molecular

49
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:20,000
genetic studies taking a transcriptional profiling and doing clustering and looking at the different pattern instead of there it's also useful for Michael

50
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:30,000
how do you say it's also these ideas are very powerful and studying a cognition so the so if you'd like it to work the Josh tanenbaum does and

51
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:40,000
McDermott study to develop mathematical models of how our minds work how we learn to think about things those are also

52
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:50,000
model based in very quantitative so the kind of working alone in this class of very broadly applicable they're also increasingly important in medicine

53
00:08:50,000 --> 00:09:00,000
soul where can I get some point working to take a little bit of a detour to look at a particular disease that's caused by

54
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:10,000
in fact in an ion channel and it turns out you can understand exactly how that the fact that I am channel relates to this particular to

55
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:20,000
a type of the disease ok you can do that by creating a mathematical model of how a noren behaves when it has an ion channel that has this defective

56
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:30,000
very quiet and once you model that you can really understand why that happens ok so here are some of the course goes so

57
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:40,000
we're going to start by working on basic biophysics ignorant in networks and other that sort of principles underlying brain and cognitive functions were going to develop maths

58
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:50,000
all techniques to analyse those models and to analyse the kinds of behavioral data and normal dated that you would take to to study those brain surgery

59
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:00,000
and in the along the way we're going to become proficient at using MATLAB to do these things so how many of you have Xperia

60
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:10,000
MATLAB OK great and not ok so anybody who doesn't have experience with MATLAB we're going to

61
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:20,000
really make an effort to bring you up to speed very quickly Daniel has actually just created a very nice MATLAB cheat sheet that's just amazing

62
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:30,000
sell Daryl be like to help with programming some of the topics that will be covering so will be talking

63
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:40,000
equivalent Circuit model of explain how this is broken down so these are topics that we're

64
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:50,000
and these are sorry the mathematical tools that go along with those topics that will be learning about in parallel ok so will be starting normal

65
00:10:50,000 --> 00:11:00,000
sex and we'll be doing some difference equations a long way for that just first order linear difference equations and I think to be scared out I will talk about normal response

66
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:10,000
the stimuli and tuning curves and along the way will be learning about spike sorting in Perth stimulus time Instagrams and ways of analysing Byron patterns

67
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:20,000
coding and receptive fields and will learn about correlation and convolution for that topic we'll talk about feed-forward networks in percent

68
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:30,000
we're gonna start bringing a lot of linear algebra which is really fun it's really powerful and that linear algebra sets

69
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:40,000
stayed for than doing dimensionality reduction on data and principal component analysis and singular value decomposition other things

70
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:50,000
then take an additional extension of neural networks from feed for an hour so figure out how to make them talk back to themselves so they can

71
00:11:50,000 --> 00:12:00,000
doing things like remember things ok and make decisions and that involves more linear algebra eigenvalues and then

72
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm not sure we're going to get time to sensory integration and bass rock so by the end of the class there are some important skill

73
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:20,000
that you're have are you able to think about a noren very clearly and how it's components work together to give

74
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Iran it's properties and how Normans themselves can connect together to give anal Circuit it's properties

75
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:40,000
attack write MATLAB programs that simulate those models you'll be able to analyse data using MATLAB your bill to Visual

76
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:50,000
high dimensional datasets and you one of my goals in this class is that you guys should be able to go into any lab in the department

77
00:12:50,000 --> 00:13:00,000
call things that even the graduates to his benighted do ok it so you can do really great stuff as you're up

78
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:10,000
ok so one of the most important things about the

79
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:20,000
class is problem sets because that's where you're going to get the hands on experience to do that kind of that analysis and write programs and an

80
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:30,000
the data please install that it's really important if you don't already have that Wheels like scripts for prom sets

81
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:40,000
and Daniel made some nice examples on Stella and of course that the guidelines for peace at submissions are also on Stella

82
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:50,000
that's it any questions about that so let's let's go ahead and

83
00:13:50,000 --> 00:14:00,000
and get started than with the first topic

84
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:10,000
ok so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to build a model of a Nerang

85
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:20,000
this model is is very particular it uses electrical components to to describe then you're on now that mean

86
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:30,000
prising sense in Iran is basically an electrical device it has components that are sensitive to voltage is that generate current that control current

87
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:40,000
are answer we're going to build a model using electrical circuit components and one of the nice things about doing that is that every electrical search

88
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:50,000
like a resistor a capacitor has a very well-defined mathematical relation between current and the voltage

89
00:14:50,000 --> 00:15:00,000
close to that device and the voltage across the terminals of that by so you can write down very precisely mathematically what each of those compose

90
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:10,000
so then you can then take that all those components and construct a set of

91
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:20,000
or in general a set of differential equations that allows you to basically evolved that circuit overtime and plotly

92
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:30,000
voltage I'm inside the cell as a function of time you can see that that model moron can actually very precisely replicate many

93
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:40,000
properties of Norris actually really complicated and this is this is the real reason why you need to write

94
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:50,000
there are many different kinds of Lawrence each type of Iran has a different pattern of genes that are expressed so this is a cluster diagram

95
00:15:50,000 --> 00:16:00,000
call type based on a transcriptional profiling of the RNA that each that I think it was about $13,000 on that were extracted from a part of the

96
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:10,000
you do the transcriptional profiling gives you up a map of all the different genes are expressed in each Laurent and then you can Costa them and you can see that the

97
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:20,000
part of the brain which is in the hypothalamus expresses all of these different cell types what are those different sheets many of the

98
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:30,000
paintings are actually different ion channels and there are hundreds of different kinds of ion channels that control the flow of current through across the Membrane of a Nora

99
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:40,000
cancel this is just a diagram showing different potassium ion channels different calcium ion channels you can see they have families and and

100
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:50,000
subtypes in all of those different ion channels have different time scales on which the current varies as a function of voltage change they have different voltage

101
00:16:50,000 --> 00:17:00,000
what's the third sensitive to have different inactivation so many ion channels when you turn them on is stay on but other ion channels they turn on and then they slow

102
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Decay away break the current slowly 2 k's away and inactivation and all these different ion channels have different combinations of those properties and it's really

103
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:20,000
hard to predict when you think about how this Nerang will behave with a different kind of ion channel here it's super hard

104
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:30,000
just like look at the properties of an ion channel and just see how that's going to work in Andorra because you have all these different parts that are working together ok

105
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Gillian Porter bill to write down a mathematical model if you have an Iran it has I could different kinds of iron tell you can actually predict how the door is going to behave

106
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:50,000
no that's just the ion channel components Laurels also have complex morphologies right there has some some morons have the

107
00:17:50,000 --> 00:18:00,000
this is a n t cell in the cerebellum they have these very dense densely elaborated dendrites other animals have very long dendrites with just a few branches

108
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I don't have very short stubby dendrites and each of those different morphological patterns also affects however

109
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:20,000
response to it's Imports because now I'm out here at the end of the day or a course to the Soma and and

110
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:30,000
what does the spatial structure also affect our non-response and and those produced very different firing panel so not Sumner

111
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:40,000
if you put in a constant current they just buy a regulator so turns out we can really understand why all of these things different

112
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:50,000
things happen if we build a model actress

113
00:18:50,000 --> 00:19:00,000
different parts of the circuit actually do call different things so neuron's have are not just one power supply they've got multiple power

114
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:10,000
hi is the power up different parts of the circuit that do different things have capacitances that allow unknown to accumulate

115
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:20,000
overtime act as an integrated if you combine a capacitor with a resistor that that circuit now looks like a foot

116
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:30,000
it's smooth it's past inputs overtime alright and these two components here this sodium current and this potassium make a spike

117
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:40,000
generates an action potential that then talks to other nerds ok and you put the whole thing together and that thinking act like an oscillator it can act like a coin

118
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:50,000
detector that can do all kinds of different call things and all that stuff is understandable if you just write down a simple

119
00:19:50,000 --> 00:20:00,000
any questions ok so what we're going to do is we're going to

120
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:10,000
describing this network we're gonna build it up One Piece at a time and we're going to

121
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:20,000
with a capacitance but before we get to the capacitor we need to do one more thing we need to do one thing first which is bigger

122
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:30,000
wires are in the brain break an electrical circuit you need to have wires so what are the wires in the rain

123
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:40,000
what wires do in a circuit so what what what

124
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:50,000
in anora what's that carry information

125
00:20:50,000 --> 00:21:00,000
like that the travels down the axon a ghost other Norris but there's even not simpler answer than that yes

126
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:10,000
ion channels are these resistors here but what is it that connects all those components to each other

127
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:20,000
is the intracellular and extracellular solution ok and so what we're going to do today is understand how the intracellular

128
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:30,000
cellular solution acts as a wire and it's not just it's not quite as simple as it as a piece of metal

129
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:40,000
hey it's it's a bit more complicated there different ways you can get current flow in in intracellular and extracellular solution

130
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:50,000
can I go through that and we're going to analyse that in some some detail in the brain

131
00:21:50,000 --> 00:22:00,000
why is our our intracellular and extracellular salt solutions and you get current flow that results from the movement of eyes

132
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:10,000
in that aqueous solution so so the solution concesso ions like in exercise

133
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:20,000
mostly sodium ions and chloride ions that are dissolved in water what is a polar solvent that means that the negative parts that the oxygen

134
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:30,000
slightly negatively charged oxygen is attracted to a positive ions ok and the intracellular and extracellular space are filled with salt

135
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:40,000
at a concentration of about 100 mm and that corresponds to having one of these ions

136
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:50,000
about every 25 angstroms apart so at those concentrations there are a lot of

137
00:22:50,000 --> 00:23:00,000
and I was Iron can move under different conditions to produce currents

138
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:10,000
current flow in the brain through to primary different mechanism diffusion which is caused by

139
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:20,000
variations in the concentration ok and drifts of particles in an electric field so when you put an electric fields of

140
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:30,000
a beaker filled with salt solution you put two metal electrodes in it to produce an electric field that causes these ions to drift in

141
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:40,000
and that's another source of current that we're going to look at today so here are our learning object

142
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:50,000
for today we're going to understand how the time scales of diffusion relate to the length scale and that's a really interesting story that's very important

143
00:23:50,000 --> 00:24:00,000
we're going to understand how concentration gradients lead to currents that's not as fix first law and we're going to understand

144
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:10,000
charges drifting electric field in a way that leads to current and the mathematical relation that describes voltage differences

145
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:20,000
that is called Ohm's law in the brain and we're going to learn about the concept of resistivity

146
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:30,000
so the first thing we need to talk about if we're going to talk about the Fusion is thermal energy so every particle in the world is being done

147
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:40,000
by other particles that are crashing into it and at thermal equilibrium every degree of freedom every way that

148
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:50,000
call can move either forward and backward left and right up and down or rotations this way or this way or whichever way I didn't

149
00:24:50,000 --> 00:25:00,000
come to equilibrium at a particular energy is proportional to temperature in other words

150
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:10,000
particle is moving in this direction in equilibrium if we're having kinetic energy in that direction that is equal to that is proportional to the

151
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:20,000
temperature is is in units of Calvin relative to absolute zero and the proportionality constant is the boltzmann constant

152
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:30,000
connects of drawers per Kelvin Sony x the boltzmann constant k x temperature what you find is

153
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Freedom will come to equilibrium at 4 x 10 - 21 joules which is in amount of energy

154
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:50,000
room temperature at zero temperature you can see that every degree of freedom has zero energy and so nothing is moving nothing is rotating the

155
00:25:50,000 --> 00:26:00,000
morning any direction everything is perfectly still ok so let's calculate how

156
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:10,000
fast particles move at thermal equilibrium in room temperature so we can may remember from

157
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:20,000
breast physics class that the kinetic energy of a particle is proportional to the velocity squared one have MV squared so the average velocity

158
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:30,000
have a particle at thermal equilibrium it's just 1/2 times that much energy

159
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:40,000
it how fast like a particle is moving for example a sodium ion so you can see that the

160
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Fred velocity squared is just Katie of RAM we just divide both sides by

161
00:26:50,000 --> 00:27:00,000
to the velocity average life his greatest 10 of the 5 m squared per second squared to take the square of that and you get the average locity is 320 m

162
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:10,000
set me a set the air molecules which have a similar mass to the study of mind

163
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:20,000
300 metres per second so I would cross this room in a few hundreds of a second game

164
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:30,000
gold wedding along at 300 m per second what happens to them

165
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:40,000
when do each other there are crashing into into each other constantly ok so in solution apareco Collides with a water

166
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:50,000
every about 10 of the 13 times per second 10 of the -13 seconds between collisions moving a little

167
00:27:50,000 --> 00:28:00,000
moving a letter from Direction crash in moving in a different direction crashing ok so it's just if you follow one particle is just kind of jumping around

168
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:10,000
ok it's diffusing so what does that look like that Daniel made a little video that shows sort of 2 scale this is possession in

169
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:20,000
and time is in real time so this video shows in real-time what the motion of a particle might look like

170
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Kennedy point it's just moving it it's moving colliding and moving off in some random Direction

171
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:40,000
you actually see this if you look at a very small particle

172
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:50,000
who was the tenure who did that experiment looking at pollen is brownian a brown what was his first name

173
00:28:50,000 --> 00:29:00,000
brownian motion have you got a brownian motion so somebody named Brown was looking at Holland particles in water and noticing the

174
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:10,000
letter Jump Around just like this and he hypothesize that there were being just All Around by the water

175
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:20,000
ok any questions ok so

176
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:30,000
what can we say about this there's there's something really interesting about diffusion it's that's very at non-intuitive it first

177
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Asian some really strange aspect to it that it distance that a particle can defuse depends very much on the Thai

178
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:50,000
and it's not just a simple relation so let's just look at this so let's ask how much time does it take for an iron

179
00:29:50,000 --> 00:30:00,000
to defuse a short distance like across the but the salvo the Soma of an Era so an iron can diffuser

180
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:10,000
the song of an era in about the 20th of the 2nd how about down so let's

181
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Orion in the cell body and asked how long does it take an iron to reach the end of a dendrite that can be about a millimetre away

182
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:30,000
can take about 10 minutes that's how long it will take an iron to get that far away from it's starting point

183
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:40,000
how about frequency 20th of August 2nd here here it's like 5500 seconds

184
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:50,000
but 10 minutes about how long does it take an iron starting at the cell body to defuse all the way down so you know there are no words in your body that start

185
00:30:50,000 --> 00:31:00,000
spinal cord and all go all the way down to your feet so motoneurons in your spinal cord can be very long accents

186
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:10,000
trying to get from from the Soma all the way down to the end of an accident along axon

187
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:20,000
somebody just take a gas it's 20th of the 2nd here 10 minutes

188
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:30,000
anybody want to get an hour 10 years ok

189
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:40,000
why is that that's crazy right how is that password.in so you know that a cell body is making proteins in or

190
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:50,000
stop that have to get down to build synapses at the other end of that accident and and proteins diffuser hack about slower than irons do so so

191
00:31:50,000 --> 00:32:00,000
a submarine could make stuff for that for the axon it would never get there in your entire lifetime and that's why cells have to

192
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:10,000
make little trains that they literally make little trains that package up stuff and put it on the train and it just marches down the axon until it gets to the

193
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:20,000
to that to the end and this is the reply ok so we're going to do is I'm going to just walks you through a very simple there

194
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:30,000
a why this is true and how do think about it ok to do so normally things defuse in three dimensions

195
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:40,000
but it's just my charger to analyse things you can get you can get basically the right answer just by analysing how things diffuse in one dimension

196
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:50,000
tell me the story of video to show show you what this looks like this is I think 100 particles or lined up near zero and we're going to turn on the video

197
00:32:50,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I'm also defusing it one moment ok so you can just watch what happens to all these different particles

198
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:10,000
end up over here on the left other particles end up over here on the right you can see that the distribution of particles kind of spreads out

199
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:20,000
ok it's already pick up why that is where why that happens so the first thing I just want to tell you is that the

200
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:30,000
population of particles if they all start at zero ok in a diffuser 1D away from zero the distribution that you get is gaussian

201
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:40,000
ok and the basic reason is that started the centre and every time that they have a probability of one half of going to the right and one half of going to the

202
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:50,000
cancel basically there are many more combinations of ways a particle can do some laughs and do some rice and end

203
00:33:50,000 --> 00:34:00,000
quote started it's very unlikely that the particle will do like a whole bunch of going right all in a row and so that's why it's

204
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:10,000
the density in the distribution is very low down here ok and so you end up with something that's just a gaussian distribution

205
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:20,000
so let's say let's to analyse this in a little more detail so we're going to just make a simple very simple model of particles

206
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:30,000
to the right or to the left we're going to consider a particle that is

207
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:40,000
operated a fixed velocity VX4 sometime towel before a collision and working imagine the each time the particle collider resets it's

208
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:50,000
randomly either to the laughter to the right every time will step right by a distance Delta

209
00:34:50,000 --> 00:35:00,000
velocity times the time tower and the other have two particles will step left by that same distance OK so they're going to either to the left or the right

210
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:10,000
to the right by a distance Delta if we start with n particles

211
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:20,000
all of them started position 0 at x 0 then the we can write down the position of

212
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:30,000
protocol a time step I sorry time step and ice particle a time step and we're going to the each particles

213
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:40,000
doing their own thing ignoring each other so now you can see that you can write down the position of

214
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:50,000
miracle at time step n is just the position of the particle at the previous time step plus or minus this little Delta

215
00:35:50,000 --> 00:36:00,000
any any questions by that ok

216
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:10,000
if you ever just haven't followed one step that I do I've just let me know I'm happy to explain it again I asked them I'm watching somebody

217
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:20,000
something really simple and my brain is just in some funny state and I'm I just don't get it so it's totally fine if you

218
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I mean explain something that you don't have to be embarrassed cause happens to me all the time ok so now what we can do is use this expression

219
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:40,000
compute how that distribution involves over time that distribution of particles this does ice particle overtime

220
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:50,000
time step in the average position of the ensemble is so these brackets mean average so the bracket with an I

221
00:36:50,000 --> 00:37:00,000
that I'm averaging this quantity over I particles ok so it's just the sum of positions

222
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:10,000
for every protocol divided by the number of particles that the average position so again the position of the ice particle time step and it's just the

223
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:20,000
record the previous time step plus or minus Delta we just plug that into their into there and now we calculate the sun but we have to terms we

224
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:30,000
and that turn lights break them up in the two separate sums so this is equal to the sum over the previous positions plus the sun

225
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:40,000
how much the change was from one time step to the next that make sense but what is this song for something

226
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:50,000
all the particles how much they changed from the previous time step to this time stop what half of the move to the right in the left

227
00:37:50,000 --> 00:38:00,000
so that song It's just 0 can see that the average position of the particle at this of the park

228
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:10,000
at this time step is just equal to the average position of the particles at the previous times that means is that the centre of the distribution chain

229
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:20,000
if you stole the particles that 0 they defuse around the average position is still 0

230
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:30,000
this year

231
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:40,000
just herself this bracket means I'm averaging over this quantity I so you can see that's what I'm doing something all right and dividing by the number

232
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:50,000
particle particle number so if we have 10 particles I goes from 1 to 10 thank you

233
00:38:50,000 --> 00:39:00,000
ok so that's boring but we use the wheels to trick here

234
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:10,000
where can I use now to actually calculate the interesting thing which is on on average how far to the particles get from where they started

235
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:20,000
calculate the average position of all the protocols were going to calculate the average absolute value

236
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:30,000
where they started ask on average how far do they get from where they started wood 40

237
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:40,000
so absolute values not really likes the hard to deal with but this is exactly

238
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:50,000
the same as calculating the square root of the average square the same as calculating

239
00:39:50,000 --> 00:40:00,000
that make sense ok so what we're going to do as we're going to calculate the variance of that distribution I am the square root of that various is just the start

240
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:10,000
deviation which is just how wide it is which is just how far on average the particles got from where they started

241
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:20,000
ok so let's push on we're going to calculate the average square distance that was going to take the square that at the end

242
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:30,000
so the average of the position squared we're going to plug this into here ok so ring a square it so the

243
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:40,000
turn on the particle squared is just this quantity squared let's Factor it out so we have this term squared + that twice that times that

244
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:50,000
what's that term square ok and we're going to now plug that average so the average position squared is just

245
00:40:50,000 --> 00:41:00,000
the average position squared at this time step and is the average position squared at the previous time step

246
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:10,000
plus some other stuff and I take a look at what that other stuff is this is posture - 2 times

247
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:20,000
which is the step it takes the size of the staff times at so what is what is that average of these are positive

248
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:30,000
these are -0 and 1 it is the average of Delta Square Road Delta

249
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:40,000
is always positive right so what is this say what this says is that that parents

250
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:50,000
at best time step is just the variance at a previous time step is a constant is that what does

251
00:41:50,000 --> 00:42:00,000
is the each time step the various grows by some constant Delta is a distance

252
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:10,000
the units of variance of a distribution at the function of Distance if the various at x 0

253
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:20,000
direct me to all lined up at the Origin 1 x two-player the various will be Delta squared the next time step it will be two Delta square the next time step

254
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:30,000
up at some time step and it will be an x Delta square so you see what's happening the variance this distribution is growing linearly

255
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:40,000
we can change from time steps to continuous time so time step

256
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:50,000
time that time then step number is just time the tower which is some interval in time like the in

257
00:42:50,000 --> 00:43:00,000
twinkle Asian it so you can see that the variance is just growing linearly in time where the variance is just 2 time

258
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:10,000
e x t where d is the is what we call the diffusion coefficient is just length squared / time

259
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:20,000
why is that because as time grows the variance

260
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:30,000
so if we want to get from we want to take time x something that gives

261
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:40,000
variance it has to be variance per unit time and variance for something that the distribution of disease

262
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:50,000
has to have position square yes ok it's just the

263
00:43:50,000 --> 00:44:00,000
built into the definition of the diffusion constant ok

264
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:10,000
any questions about that so now what I can tell you so and now here here is the answer

265
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:20,000
so the variance is going linearly in time what that means is that the standard deviation distance the average distance from the start

266
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:30,000
is growing as the square root of time and that's that's key out that I want you to remember

267
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:40,000
the distance

268
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:50,000
fuses from it's starting point on average gross is the square root of time

269
00:44:50,000 --> 00:45:00,000
ok so pretty small molecule typical small molecule the diffusion constant is 10 of -5

270
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:10,000
metre squared per second we can just plug in some distances and times and see what how long

271
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Lexapro how long it takes this particle to defuse some distance ok so it's do that lets plug in a length of 10 microns that was arse Omar

272
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:30,000
what's $10 - 3 cm time is that squared Lang square so it's 10 of -6 cm

273
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:40,000
divided by the diffusion constant 2 times the diffusion constant 2 x 10 - 5 cm squared per second is 6 m squared cancel that leaves us

274
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:50,000
50 milliseconds in 1 mm that was the length of the dendrite

275
00:45:50,000 --> 00:46:00,000
so that's 10 of the -1 centimetre so we plug that into our equation for time time is just l square I forgot to actually

276
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:10,000
is the equation that I'm solving so what is the equation of

277
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:30,000
squared is equal to 2 DT and I'm strolling 40 squared over to see that's that's the question I'm so

278
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:40,000
I'm giving you a length and I'm calculating how long it takes

279
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:50,000
so if you put in 10 of -1 here you get 10 of the -2 / 2 x 7 seconds which is about 10 minutes

280
00:46:50,000 --> 00:47:00,000
how if you ask how long does it take to go a metre that's 10 of the 2 cm it's 10 of the 4/10 - 5

281
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:10,000
somebody over here figured it out right away about 5 x 10 of 8

282
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:20,000
a year is pi x 10/72 + 4 - 50%

283
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:30,000
ok questions birthday

284
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:40,000
call Sona runes and South and biology has

285
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:50,000
to extraordinary lengths to overcome this craziness

286
00:47:50,000 --> 00:48:00,000
which explains a lot of the structure you see in cells ok

287
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:10,000
so there's another so that's at so you can see the diffusion causes the movement of iron

288
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:20,000
from places where their concentrated to places where there are so many iron straight so let's take a little bit slightly more

289
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:30,000
look at that idea so am I tell you but now I fix first lot in the ideas Fusion producers are Netflix particles from regions of high concept

290
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:40,000
the regions of low lower concentrate and the flux of particles is proportional to the concentration gradient I know this is just really up it's

291
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:50,000
if you have a box and on the left side of the box you have particles that on the right side of the box then you're going to have party

292
00:48:50,000 --> 00:49:00,000
refusing from here to there you're going to have particles defusing from there to there but because there are more of them over here they're just going to be more particles going this way

293
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:10,000
then our that way here still has

294
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:20,000
and have a 50% chance of diffusing here or staying here diffusing somewhere else in particles here also equally have probability of going out of the way but just because

295
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:30,000
more of them here there's going to be more particles going that way you can just calculate the number of particles going this way -

296
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:40,000
number of particles going that way alright and I'll give you the net number of particles going to the right but what what is that look like

297
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:50,000
you have the number here minus the number distance away and what if you were to divide that by

298
00:49:50,000 --> 00:50:00,000
the distance what would it look like looks like a derivative so if you can't collect the flux

299
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:10,000
it's minus the diffusion constant as one of the Delta the separation between these boxes the concentration here minus the concentration there and that

300
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:20,000
it's just a derivative and that's fixed first one I have a few slides at the end of the lecture that that do this derivation

301
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:30,000
more completely so please take a look at that if you have time OK this is

302
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:40,000
an important concept ok this fix for slot the fact that particles that concentration gradients produce a flow of ions of

303
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:50,000
is so fundamental to Hannah aren't work in here we're going to be building that up over the course of the next couple actress

304
00:50:50,000 --> 00:51:00,000
so imagine that you have a cell that has a lot of potassium ions inside and very few potassium ions outside and you can see that

305
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:10,000
you're going to have potassium ions diffusing from here to sorry and I forgot to say let's say that you're so all in it so are you going to help

306
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:20,000
defusing from inside the outside through the whole you also have some potassium ions out here and some of those my defuse in but they're just

307
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:30,000
how many more potassium ions inside and outside concentration wise with the probability of 1 going out through the holes just much higher than the probability of a potassium

308
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:40,000
back into the song sorry I'm just zooming in on that channel

309
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:50,000
or through the Membrane lots of potassium ions here on average there is going to Netflix potassium out through that hole

310
00:51:50,000 --> 00:52:00,000
are we can plot the concentration gradient through the whole thing can see it's high hear it decreases and it's low outside

311
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:10,000
answer there is a netflow this proportional to that steepness of concentration profile

312
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:20,000
true you get a netflow even if each particle is diffusing independently they don't know anything about each other and yet that can't

313
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:30,000
next ingredient produces a current or concentration gradients go away white why is that

314
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:40,000
calcium ions will flow from the inside of the sail to the outside of the South Island toll they're the same concentration and then you have Justice

315
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:50,000
play back inside as you have flying outside so eventually that would happen to other cells why doesn't that happen

316
00:52:50,000 --> 00:53:00,000
what that that's that's exactly the right a few intervene in a intermediate steps

317
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:10,000
if you would not be alive anymore the potassium ions which just a fuse out and that would be the end but what happens is

318
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:20,000
other iron that other proteins in the Membrane that takes those potassium ions from here and pump them back inside and maintain the concentration gradient but that cost energy

319
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:30,000
does proteins use ATP and that ATP comes from eating ok

320
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:40,000
but eventually are concentration gradients go away so so

321
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:50,000
that is how we get current flow from concentration gradients the next topic has to do with the diffusion

322
00:53:50,000 --> 00:54:00,000
in in the presence of voltage differences in the presence of voltage gradients

323
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:10,000
ok the bottom line here that I want you to know that I want you to understand is that current flowing around or Bay zones what does that mean

324
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:20,000
why do we have a resistor aleksei across a membrane or in the intracellular and extracellular space of a

325
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:30,000
the current flow through that resistive medium is proportional to the

326
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:40,000
is different the current is proportional to the voltage difference across the two terminals that

327
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:50,000
and the proportionality constant is one of the resistance so here current

328
00:54:50,000 --> 00:55:00,000
MP is the voltage difference is units of bolts and the resistance has units of ohms

329
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:10,000
questions about that ok so let's go through let's develop this ideal

330
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:20,000
understand why it is that a voltage difference produces a current that's proportional to voltage

331
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:30,000
salt solution ions in here dissolved in the water we have two metal plates we put a battery between the two metal place that holds those two

332
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:40,000
get some fixed voltage difference delta-v and we're going to ask how much what happens ok

333
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:50,000
you've been here there's one plate that's it one potential there's another played at another potential there some voltage difference between those that's Delta v the two plates are

334
00:55:50,000 --> 00:56:00,000
play distance Al and that that voltage difference produces an electric field

335
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:10,000
the points from the high voltage region to the low voltage region

336
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:20,000
so an electric field produces a force on a charge we have lots of charges in here that's proportional to the charge

337
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:30,000
and the electric field so what is that Force going to do that force is just going to rag that particle

338
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:40,000
the liquid through the water so why why is it

339
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Bestway vacuum in here and we put up a charge there and metal plates and we put a battery across what would that particle do

340
00:56:50,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Edward it would move but what what would this force due to that protocol exactly so it would have Aussie

341
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:10,000
we're just increase when you start moving it will start moving slowly and crash into the plate

342
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:20,000
now what happens here why is that stuff in the way and so it keeps it it's accelerate and

343
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:30,000
get hit by Watermark your right and it gets pushed off in summer some direction then accelerate in this direction gets it again but it's

344
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:40,000
accelerated in One Direction before it Collides ok it so here's what happens

345
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:50,000
diffusing around great but I'm eating

346
00:57:50,000 --> 00:58:00,000
up as a little bit of acceleration in this direction in the direction of the electric field

347
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:10,000
so you can show kind of using the same kind of an app that I that we used in calculate

348
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:20,000
the distribution that the changes mean and variance you can show that the mean of the other distribution

349
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:30,000
pause that starts at 0 positive particles shifts in the in the electric field linearly in time

350
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:40,000
and you can just think about that as you know the electric field reaches and grab that charged particle and like poles it in this direction

351
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:50,000
viscous drag so now a force produces a constant velocity acceleration

352
00:58:50,000 --> 00:59:00,000
is called the drift velocity so the force is proportional to drift velocity

353
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:10,000
what is that what is that little after it's the coefficient of friction

354
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:20,000
an Einstein Clovelly noticed that the coefficient of friction of a particle being dragged through a liquid

355
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:30,000
is related to White any gas Fusion about particle

356
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:40,000
that qualities like gonna give me chill the frictional coefficient is just 8000

357
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:50,000
diffusion constant so if you actually just go through that same analysis of calculating the mean of the distribution what you find is that

358
00:59:50,000 --> 01:00:00,000
moves linearly and type it also if you take if you take put your hand and and you know you're in the swimming pool you put

359
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:10,000
in the water and you push your hand with a constant force what happens what let me flip it around you move your hand through the water at a constant

360
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:20,000
what is the force feel like

361
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:30,000
yes exactly

362
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:40,000
me the same thing ok so the drift velocity is proportional to the force

363
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:50,000
proportionality constant one over the the coefficient of friction which is the no deal and what is this force proportional to

364
01:00:50,000 --> 01:01:00,000
the force is proportional to the electric field right and

365
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:10,000
so let's calculate the current so I'm going to argue that the current is proportional to the drift velocity times the area

366
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:20,000
a why is that so I have an electric field it makes this particles all the particles in this area here

367
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:30,000
is there a constant velocity in this direction so there is a certain amount of current that's flowing in this area right here

368
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:40,000
that makes sense now if my electrodes are are big and I also have electric field up here than that like 6 cars and current

369
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:50,000
appear to and if there's electric field appear then there'll be current flowing up here to it so you can see that the amount of current That's Falling between the

370
01:01:50,000 --> 01:02:00,000
is proportional to the drift velocity and the cross-sectional area between the two electrodes

371
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:10,000
cancel that's really important let's now I showed you I told you that or we figured out that the

372
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:20,000
velocity is proportional to the electric field right so that current is proportional to the electric the times the area and the electric field is just

373
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:30,000
search difference / spacing between the electrodes bright and so the current is proportional to voltage times area / length

374
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:40,000
can we have a proportionality current is proportional to voltage times area / length and now let's plugin what that tonality constant

375
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:50,000
hey we're going to let's let's think about this is now like Ohm's law or right

376
01:02:50,000 --> 01:03:00,000
is proportional to voltage difference that the proportionality constant here is something called resistivity otherwise known as

377
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:10,000
but we're going to use resistivity

378
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:20,000
difference let's rewrite that a little bit so that it looks more time slot current is proportional to voltage difference

379
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:30,000
and that thing that thing is right there should have units of what one over owns so that

380
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:40,000
1 over resistance let's just write down what the resistances resistance is resistivity x length / area

381
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:50,000
does stop and take a breath and think about why this make sense resistance is how

382
01:03:50,000 --> 01:04:00,000
resistance there is to flow at a given voltage rate so what happens if we make are really small what happens to the resistance

383
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:10,000
the the resistance gets back the amount of current get small because there's la select Plus

384
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:20,000
go to the Electric Feel This is in it so the Chromecast down and miss the resistances we make up late really big the resistance Get Smart

385
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:30,000
what happens if we pour plates further apart what happens to the resistance of the plates are four

386
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:40,000
hotel is bigger and resistance is bigger but what's going on physically what's the plates of further apart so what happens

387
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:50,000
write the voltage difference is the same but the distance is bigger and so the electric field which is voltage per

388
01:04:50,000 --> 01:05:00,000
distance is smaller and that's smaller electric field produces drift velocity and that's why the resistance

389
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:10,000
goes up ok now let's start

390
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:20,000
about resistivity resistivity in the brain is really really lousy ok the the wires of the brain

391
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:30,000
I just offal ok so if you look at the resistivity for copper which is which is the wire that you

392
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Electronics the resistivity is 1.6 micro ohms centimetres ok what time is if I took a block of copper

393
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:50,000
centimetre on a side when I put electrodes on the side of it and I measure the resistance it would be 1.6 micro homes

394
01:05:50,000 --> 01:06:00,000
amp thing with 1.6 microvolts

395
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:10,000
ok the resistivity of the brain is 60 ohm-cm

396
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:20,000
a centimetre block of saline solution intracellular extracellular discussion has a resistance of

397
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:30,000
the ohms instead of 1.6 micro homes more than a million times worse ok

398
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:40,000
what that means is that when you try to send current brand-new Strata sense of current the ball

399
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:50,000
just drops you need a huge voltage drops to produce tiny currents and that's why

400
01:06:50,000 --> 01:07:00,000
has that's why the brain has invented things accidents because the wires are

401
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:10,000
bad that you can't send a signal from one part of the brain to another part of the brain Through The Wire you have to invent this special gimmick called an action potential

402
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:20,000
signal more than a few microns away pretty cool right

403
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:30,000
why it's so interesting to understand the basic physics of something the basic mechanisms by which something works because

404
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:40,000
what you see is a hack to compensate for weird physics rate yes

405
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:50,000
this High

406
01:07:50,000 --> 01:08:00,000
you're asking what causes that high resistivity yeah it basically has to do with things like the mean free path of

407
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:10,000
the particle in a metal particles can go further effectively before they collide so there

408
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:20,000
resistivity of is Lauren no it's a property of it's a little bit different inside the cell because there's more gunk inside of a sold in there

409
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:30,000
outside of a silencer the resistivity is a little bit worse it's 2000 centimetres are 102000 inside the cell in more like 60 outside

410
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:40,000
yes what's your outside the cell it's basically the same everyone

411
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:50,000
ok so that's it so here's what we learnt about today we understood

412
01:08:50,000 --> 01:09:00,000
the difference that the relation between the timescale of diffusion and length scales we learnt that the distance that are particle can can defuse

413
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:10,000
what is the girls only is the square root of time concentration gradient

414
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:20,000
and we are we talked about fix first layer that says that concentration differences leader particle flux the flux is proportional

415
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:30,000
the gradient of the derivative of the concentration and we also talked about how the drift of charge of charged particles in an electric field

416
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:40,000
2 occurrence and how that the voltage current relation of a zones line we also talked about the concept of

417
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:50,000
