this area here\nis there a constant velocity in this direction so there is a certain amount of current that's flowing in this area right here\nthat makes sense now if my electrodes are are big and I also have electric field up here than that like 6 cars and current\nappear to and if there's electric field appear then there'll be current flowing up here to it so you can see that the amount of current That's Falling between the\nis proportional to the drift velocity and the cross-sectional area between the two electrodes\ncancel that's really important let's now I showed you I told you that or we figured out that the\nvelocity is proportional to the electric field right so that current is proportional to the electric the times the area and the electric field is just"], "3750": [36, 160, "hey we're going to let's let's think about this is now like Ohm's law or right\nis proportional to voltage difference that the proportionality constant here is something called resistivity otherwise known as\nbut we're going to use resistivity\ndifference let's rewrite that a little bit so that it looks more time slot current is proportional to voltage difference\nand that thing that thing is right there should have units of what one over owns so that\n1 over resistance let's just write down what the resistances resistance is resistivity x length / area\ndoes stop and take a breath and think about why this make sense resistance is how\nresistance there is to flow at a given voltage rate so what happens if we make are really small what happens to the resistance\nthe the resistance gets back the amount of current get small because there's la select Plus\ngo to the Electric Feel This is in it so the Chromecast down and miss the resistances we make up late really big the resistance Get Smart\nwhat happens if we pour plates further apart what happens to the resistance of the plates are four\nhotel is bigger and resistance is bigger but what's going on physically what's the plates of further apart so what happens\nwrite the voltage difference is the same but the distance is bigger and so the electric field which is voltage per\ndistance is smaller and that's smaller electric field produces drift velocity and that's why the resistance"], "3910": [37, 210, "I just offal ok so if you look at the resistivity for copper which is which is the wire that you\nElectronics the resistivity is 1.6 micro ohms centimetres ok what time is if I took a block of copper\ncentimetre on a side when I put electrodes on the side of it and I measure the resistance it would be 1.6 micro homes\namp thing with 1.6 microvolts\nok the resistivity of the brain is 60 ohm-cm\na centimetre block of saline solution intracellular extracellular discussion has a resistance of\nthe ohms instead of 1.6 micro homes more than a million times worse ok\nwhat that means is that when you try to send current brand-new Strata sense of current the ball\njust drops you need a huge voltage drops to produce tiny currents and that's why\nhas that's why the brain has invented things accidents because the wires are\nbad that you can't send a signal from one part of the brain to another part of the brain Through The Wire you have to invent this special gimmick called an action potential\nsignal more than a few microns away pretty cool right\nwhy it's so interesting to understand the basic physics of something the basic mechanisms by which something works because\nwhat you see is a hack to compensate for weird physics rate yes\nthis High\nyou're asking what causes that high resistivity yeah it basically has to do with things like the mean free path of\nthe particle in a metal particles can go further effectively before they collide so there\nresistivity of is Lauren no it's a property of it's a little bit different inside the cell because there's more gunk inside of a sold in there\noutside of a silencer the resistivity is a little bit worse it's 2000 centimetres are 102000 inside the cell in more like 60 outside"], "4120": [38, 110, "the difference that the relation between the timescale of diffusion and length scales we learnt that the distance that are particle can can defuse\nwhat is the girls only is the square root of time concentration gradient\nand we are we talked about fix first layer that says that concentration differences leader particle flux the
