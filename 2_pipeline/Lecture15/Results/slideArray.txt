ENDELEMENTWhat is neural computation?

Brain and cognitive sciences are no longer primarily descriptive
— Engineering-level descriptions of brain systems.

Use mathematical techniques to analyze neural data in a way that
allows us to relate it to mathematical models.

In this course we will have the added component that we will apply
these techniques to understand the circuits and computational
principles that underlie animal behavior.

Neurons are very complex.

Different neuron types are defined by the genes that are expressed and their
complement of ion channels

lon channels have dynamics at different timescales, voltage ranges, inactivation

What are the wires of the brain?

In the brain (in neurons), current flow results from the movement of
ions in aqueous solution (water).

Every degree of freedom comes to thermal equilibrium with
an energy proportional to temperature (Kelvin, K)

ENDELEMENTWhat is diffusion?

* A particle in solution undergoes collisions with water molecules very
often (~10'3 times per second!) that constantly change its direction
of motion.

Collisions produce a ‘random walk’ in space

Diffusion is fast at short length scales and slow at long length scales.

* To diffuse across a cell body (10um) it takes an ion 50ms
¢ To diffuse down a dendrite (1mm) it takes about 10min

* How long does it take an ion to diffuse down a motor neuron axon (1m)?

ENDELEMENTRandom walk in one dimension

We can mathematically analyze the properties of an ensemble of
particles undergoing a random walk

Consider a particle moving left or right at a fixed velocity v, for a T
time before a collision.

Imagine that each collision randomly resets the direction

Thus, on every time-step,
— half the particles step right by a distanced = +V,T

— and half the particles step to the left by a distance 6
ENDELEMENTRandom Walk in 1-D

Assume that we have N particles that start at position x=0 at time
t=0

x(n) = the position of the jth particle on time-step n: n=t/T

Assume the movement of each particle is independent

Thus, we can write the position of each particle at time-step n as a
function of the position at previous time-step

x,(n)=x,(n—-1) + 6

Use this to compute how the distribution evolves in time!

regions ot lower concentration.
