ENDELEMENTVoltage and Time dependence

* Voltage and time-dependent ion channels are the ‘knobs’ that
control membrane potential.

H&H studied the properties of K and Na channels in the squid giant
axon. In particular they wanted to study the voltage and time
dependence of the K and Na channels.

ENDELEMENTHow do we measure inactivation and recovery from inactivation?

Measuring the parameters

1. Hold V,, at different values
2. Let the Na channels inactivate
3. Then measure the Na current!
