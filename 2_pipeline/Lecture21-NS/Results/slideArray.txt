¢ LG neuron is sufficient for LG escape.

— Electrical stimulation of LG neuron produces tail flip.

« LG neuron is necessary for LG escape.

— Tail flip is not elicited if the LG neuron is hyperpolarized.

ENDELEMENTEscape behaviors are strongly modulated by
inhibition
* Escape response is suppressed while another escape

response Is in progress

— Recurrent inhibition of LG neurons (and many other neurons)
during escape behavior

* Escape response is suppressed when the animal
is restrained

moment?

ENDELEMENTTwo types of modulation of LG escape
reflex

* Absolute inhibition: The escape is inhibited
no matter how strong the excitation is.

 

* Relative inhibition: The likelihood of escape is
reduced, but it is still possible to override this
kind of inhibition.
ENDELEMENTLocation of inhibitory synapses

¢ Proximal inhibition:
— Near the spike initiating zone
— Arises from motor circuits that generate the MG escape
— Called ‘recurrent inhibition’

¢ Distal inhibition:
— Intermixed with excitatory afferents further out on the dendrite
— Arises from sensory areas
— Called ‘tonic inhibition’

Previous hypothesis:
Distal inhibition allows
selective inhibition for
particular dendritic
branches

Two-compartment model shows that the effect of proximal
and distal inhibition are different.

— Proximal inhibition: absolute

— Distal inhibition: relative

complicated models were used.
