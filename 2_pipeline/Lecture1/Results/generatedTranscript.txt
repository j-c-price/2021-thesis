arc for everything I wanted to say it so finally just decided to help with that I'm just going to be honest of several different pieces they don't make a narrative arc that's life I want to address what I see as a sort of microscopic view of organisation of the human bringing is giving us a kind of picture of what I'm going to call the architecture of human intelligence and understand intelligence in this class and so I think the overall organisation of the human brain in which we've made a lot of progress in the last 20 years gives us a kind of grill picture of what the pieces of the system are still talk about that and then oh also if I've talked fast enough do a kind of whirlwind introduction through the basic methods of human cognitive neuroscience using face recognition as an example to illustrate what you to the methods can and cannot do it so that's the attendo it's gonna be pretty basic so if you've heard me speak before he probably heard a lot of this so anyway the key question were trying to address in this course is how does the brain produce intelligent behaviour and how many we be able to replicate that intelligence in machines ok that's all there is of course a Million Different Ways to go out that question and you can go out at from computational Angela coding Prospector from a fine grain mill Circuit prospective that I need to do something that's kind of in between the things we can approach in human brains and it's really human intelligence understand it's a some intelligence is lot of it is things that we share with animals but some of it is not and so I think it's important to be able to approach this not just from the perspective of animal research magnificent as those methods are but also see what we can learn about him and friends so I'll talk a bit about the overall functional architecture of the human brain what are the basic pieces of the system in the whole get into some some different methods and what they tell us about face perception ok so at the most general level we can ask whether human intelligence as people asking for century is actually weather human intelligence is the product of a bunch of very special purpose components each optimised to solve a specific problem kind of like this device here are you have a saw for cutting wood scissors for cutting paper swords don't work that well on paper and scissors not work that well on Wood or human intelligence is the product of some work on a generic all-purpose computational power that makes us generically smart without optimising us for any particular test and just a Porsche out of the answer as an old questions in psychology the answer is both but will do that in some detail before we get into that cares and I say first of all this kind of macro-level question about functional components of the human mind & brain matters for bunch of reasons first of all I just think it's one of the most basic questions you can ask about about our selves about who we are is to ask what the base of pieces are of our minds were pragmatically this kind of divide-and-conquer research strategy has been effective in lots of different fields that are trying to understand a comp complex system would you do with this incredibly complex system we just can't even figure out how to get started one sense but won't get started as forgot it's pieces are and then maybe try to figure out help me to the pieces work and then they beat Sunday maybe not in my lifetime figure out how they all work together and some coordinated fashion and somewhat more subtly of course you want to know not just with the pieces are but with the computations are performed in each of those pieces what the representations extracted in each piece are and I think even just a functional characterization of the scope of a particular brain region already give us some important clues about the kinds of computations that go on there it's only find that is a part of the brain that primarily involved in face recognition not in reading visually presented words recognising ciantar recognising objects that already gives us some clues about the kinds of competitions it would be appropriate for that scope of task so if you tried to write the code to do that you'll be riding three different cone if it only had to do face recognition v if it also Heads the recognise so that's my list of the main reasons they prefer heaps so different ways to investigate this question and I'll meant and some of those in the second half but I want to start with Spearman who publisher paper in 1904 the American Journal of psychology this article was sandwiched between a discussion of the saw an article on the psychology of the English barrel and in this article Spearman did the following low-tech but fascinating thing he tested the haunted kids into different schools on a wide variety of different tasks and this included Scholastic achievement type things he got exam grades for me to student and a bunch of different classes and he measure of other kinds of psychological abilities including some very can psychophysical perceptual discrimination of how well can people discriminate the Braydon at the loudness of two different tones the brightness of two different flashes of white the weight of 2 different pieces of stuff and what he found what would you expect with should we expect the correlation between your ability to discriminate two different Wellness is and say you're a mass score in grade 5 on a math exam result is it most pairs of house were correlated with each other that is if you're good at 1 you're good at the others even pass that seemingly and very little to do with each other and this is a basis of the whole idea of g which is the general Factor and which is what lead the whole idea of IQ and I can test it and in America were very uptight about the idea of I kill you have a problem with this idea that are very enthusiastic the idea and we have been but aside from social users and miss uses of IQ test the point it was actually a deep Discovery about psychology that Spearman made from the fact that all of these Tathra correlated with each other he didn't know what it was kind of like Gregor Mendel inferred jeans without knowing anything about molecular biology Spearman just inferred there's something general about it the human intellect such that there are these strong correlations about 10 across ok so that's g but less well-known experiments work is he also talked about the specific Factor S&S with the fact that I will the broad result of his experiments was it most parents of Transport correlated strongly correlated with others and then you can Factor those out and discover some mental abilities that weren't just in a broadly shared across subjects and I think this kind of foreshadows everything that we see with functional MRI there is a lot of specific acids and there's also you can see those in different brain regions as I will detail next was invented by here get the distinct mental faculties that live in different parts of the brain which I think is more or less right as they are you but you know call lived in the 1700s never never a machine so he did the best ticket which wasn't so hard he invented the infamous method of chronology he felt the bumps on the school and try to release there's two specific abilities of different individuals and from this inferred 27 mental faculties my favourites are amativeness filial piety and generation answer will the support of the right idea but kind of the wrong method and another method that was a very early one was the method of studying the loss of specific mental abilities after brain damage and so often credited as being the first experiment whole neuroscientist around making lesions in pigeons and rabbits and didn't send them testing them on various things and he didn't really fine much difference in what part of the brain he took out for the mental abilities me that's because he wasn't too hot experimental in only didn't have great experimental methods in any case he argued that all sensory and volitional faculties exist in the Cerebral hemispheres and must be regarded as occupying concurrently the same seat and those fractures right and otherwise everything is on top of everything else in the brain so that was good of you know you for a while people thought gold was kind of a crackpot even though he wrote very popular books and went around here up giving popular electricity huge numbers of people attended the respectable intellectual Society didn't take them seriously and play dear of the possession of function wasn't taken seriously until Paul broker member of the the French Academy set up in front of the society of anthropology in Paris in 1861 and announced that the left frontal lobe is a sheet of speech and this was based on his patient man was brain is shown here 10 was named tan because that was all he could say after damage to his left inferior frontal lobe and broke a pointed out that 10 had lots of other mental faculties preserved in it was simply speech that was disrupted in from this was kind of one of the first respectable people to are you for localisation of function by the end of the sensory and motor functions do exhibit localisation of function in the brain there different regions for basic visual processing auditory and so forth and that was no longer controversial but the functions were localised in distinct parts of the brain was controversial then and remains controversial now and so it up focus on its function of the right because it's played a huge role in addressing this question at this kind of microscopic level and I think you guys know whenever I machinist in case anybody's bet on Morris for a while it's important measure is a very indirect measure of neural activity by we have a long calls or Chain neuron's Fire you in metabolic cost and blood flow changes to that region blood flow increase more than compensates for oxygen use producing a local decrease rather than the expected increase in the oxyhaemoglobin relative what's the humour Goulburn those two are magnetically different that's what the MRI machine to text it's very indirect source remarkable it works as well as it does and it's currently the best non-invasive methods we have in humans are in terms of both special at having both Facial Oil special Resolution that ok so many very diving into the details of the day to be collected but I'm here for another projects and are coming from other Fields of basic form out of the data in the typical functional MRI study is you have tens of thousands of three-dimensional pixels or voxels that you scan and those typically is sample a whole set once every 2 seconds or so you can put it in do it every second or less under special circumstances you can have more voxels by sampling at higher resolution for that's a ballpark of the format of the kind of you can get a brain activity ok so a few things with the method and it's limitations cos they really important in terms of what you can learn from function on the right and what you can't so first of all this is a timeline my x axis in those invisible is time in seconds and so if you imagine looking at V1 and presenting a brief seat 10th of the 2nd high contrast flash of a chequerboard what we know from neurophysiology is that Lauren's fire within 100 Ms of official onset information gets rid of their really fast the Bold which stands for what oxygenation level-dependent or function on my response is way lagged behind this ok so the new ones are firing way over here in this graph essentially at time zero 10th of the 2nd but the MRI response is 6 seconds later ok so it's really slow and that has a supplications about what we can and cannot warrant from it because it's so slow we we can't resolve the steps in a computation for fast systems like vision and hearing and language understanding systems for which we have dedicated machinery that's highly efficient where you can recognise the gist of the scene with Anna port of a second one it flashes on a screen in front of you that and and similarly you understand the meaning of the sentence a rapidly that you've already passed might of the sentence in a well before the sentence is over right so these are extremely efficient rapid metal processes that means the components steps in those mental processes happened over 10 or a few tens of MS and we're off way off in temporal resolution with Uncle Emma all those things are squash together on top of each other that's a drag that's just like we can see those individual components snaps the second thing is that the special resolution is the best that we have in humans 9 these lovely right now but it's absolutely awful compared to what you can do animals so I miss timber Carlos top yesterday but but those methods are spectacular you can record from individual neuron's recorder precise activity with beautiful time information and contrast functional MRI is like you know the Dark Ages we have typically hundreds of thousands of neuronz in each bottle so the real miracle a functional Mariah is we ever see anything at all better than just garbage because you're coming over so many her on that once and it's just a lucky fact of the organisation of the human free and that you have clusterings of neuronz with similar responsible activities and similar functions at such a macro grand that you can see some stuff with functional MRI although you miss a lot as well important limit the function that comes out of just a consideration of the methods measures is that you can only really see differences between conditions with functional MRI the magnitude of the MRI response in a Vauxhall at a time point is meaningless it might be in a 563 and that's all it means nothing it means nothing it's just the break of the intensity of Emma I said no the only way to make it mean something is to compare it to something else usually two different house or two different stimuli and so you can go far with that but it's important to realise you can't train translated into any kind of absolute pleasure of neural activity it's only a relative measure of strength of neural activity between two different two or more different conditions ok and the final in a limitation of function on the right is that we don't use that's convenient freeze neural activity is very convenient cuz it's extreme fittingly so because we don't know exactly what kind of neural activity is driving the ball response it could be spikes for action potentials it could be sacked it snapped activity that doesn't lead to spikes it could be tonic in a bichon it could be all kinds of different things anything that's metabolically expensive is likely to increase the blood blood flow response in practice when people have looked at it it's very nicely correlated with firing rate right with some you know bumps and caveat so you can never be totally sure but there's it's a pretty good proxy for firing rate you just need to remember the back of your mind that it could be other stuff to the final very important caveat is that function and write like like most other methods were you just recording the royal activity and I've arrived different ways your chest watching you're not intervening and that means you're not measuring the causal role of the things you measure and that's very important because it could be that everything you measure is just the Abbey phenomenon has absolutely nothing to do with behaviour so I'm practice it's unlikely that you have all the systematic stuff for no reason but you need to keep in mind that functioning right is not a forwards no window at all into the causal role of different regions for that any to compliment with other methods so despite all these limitations I think he has had a huge impact on the field and in admittedly I'm biased but I think it's one of these things were as it happens in a wicked so used to a result the minute it gets published as I go yeah right review by step back so I made a bunch of pictures to to show you why I think this is important here is Penfield map functional map of the human brain published in 1957 before I was born and he has sex bomb sex functional regions labelled in their you probably can't see them but it's the basic sensory and motor regions cortex auditory cortex motor cortex speech appearing broca's area in then my favourite is this word that is appreciative thanks anyway based on electrical recording it stimulation in patients with epilepsy undergoing brain surgery actually a very powerful method but that's where it's Adam he published this near the end of his career and that's nice but it's pretty rudimentary ok now Qatar 1990 immediately before the advent advent of Funk Samurai and I really crude the blackout blinds are the basic sensory and motor regions and I've added a couple of big colour blogs for Regency has been identified by setting patients with brain damage so you know even from Broken wernicke was known that approximately these regions were involved in language because people will damage their lost a language abilities you get waxed in your pride a little you have weird attention problems like turn the left out of space and stuff like if you have damaged somewhere of the back end of the right hemisphere is you might lose face recognition ability these things were known by around 1990 not much else that's basically the function map of the brain 1990 ok that's the problem and history to a lot of you to me ok here we are today particular part of the human brain which have been whose function has been characterized quite precisely not in the sense that we know the precise circuits in there or that we can very precisely characterize the representations are computations but to the extent that we know that our region may be very selectively involved for example in thinking about what other people are thinking I totally remarkable result that Rebecca sax who discovered it will tell you about which is here next week ok so that was completely unknown even 15 years ago lower back in 1990 and likewise most of these other regions were known only in either known in the blue area sense or not with this Precision so I think even though this is very limited in its kind of steps 0 and trying to understand the human brain I think it's important progress and I think to push the little farther I want to see this as an admittedly very blurry but still a picture of the architecture of human intelligence what are the basic pieces what is it we have been here to work with when we think we have these basic pieces up on some more that hasn't been discovered yet and a lot more than we need to know about each of these and how they interact and all of that but you know a reasonable beginning so that's my story year ok for fun this is me with a bunch of functional regions identified in my brain and so there are you in I'm making here is of the human mind & brain contains a set of Highly specialised components each solving a different specific problem and that each of these regions is present in essentially every normal person is just part of the basic architecture of the human mind & brain now this view it's pretty simple but none the left it's awesome confused with a whole bunch of other things that people think about the same thing and that art so it's starting to drive me and saying so I'm going to take 5 minutes and go through the things this does not mean and ok I hope this doesn't insults your intelligence but it's amazing how in the current leader in the field people completely sex ok so I'm talking about functional specificity which is suppression of whether this particular region right here is engaged in pretty selectively and just that particular mental process and not lots of other metal prices in so that's what I mean by functional specificity that's a different idea than anatomical specificity and it's because specificity would say is only this region that's involved and nothing else is involved that's a different question how specific is this region verses are there other reasons that do something similar also an interesting question but a different one OK I'm going to go through this phone so if any of it doesn't make sense just freeze your hand and all ok but yet another ideas the necessity of a brain region for a particular function question is not only turn on what you do but do you absolutely need it for x and so that's actually a Central question that's that closely connected to really part of functional specificity is a causal question it's different for the question of sufficiency brain region sufficient for a mental process of a wrong headed question cuz nothing's ever sufficient it's just kind of a confused idea that would mean we excise my face area we put it in a dish keep all the run saliva force pretend we could do that I'm sure to figure out how to do that in a weekend we have this thing alive and it can it do face recognition the information information doesn't get out and then the rest of the brain it's not doesn't help a face purse afraid so you need things to be connected up and then you need lots of other brain regions to be involved so what's distinguished with a displaying region is functionally specific for a process from whether it's sufficient for the whole process of course it's ok question of conductivity great so people often say oh well this this region is part of a network. My reaction is like it's part of a network everything is part of a network in no way does that engage with the question of whether that region is functionally specific write a function Pacific region of course is network attacks to other brain regions those other bring readers made play an important role in it's processing sure at the very least the necessary for getting the information in and out and using it ok ok alright the final thing that people confuse out with functional specificity is an anus this is a very different concept just because we have some printicular part of the brain for which we make it really strong evidence that it's very specifically involved in mental process x that's cool that's important that's completely orthogonal to how it got wired up and whether it's innately specified in the Genome bad whole Circuit or whether that circuit is instructed by experienced over development or as in the usual case very complicated combinations of the still ok so just to remind you that functional specificity is a different question from the neatness and one way you can see that very clearly is to consider the case of the visual word for Mary but which I'll show you some theatre in the moment the visual word for area responds selectively two words and letters strings in orthography you know not an orthography you don't know it's very anatomically stereotyped mine is approximately right there and so was yours and your brain and it response to orthographies you know if you can read Arabic and Hebrew yours also response when you look at birds in Arabic in Hebrew if you can it doesn't for us as a whole lot less ok so that's a function of your individual experience not your ancestors experience it has strong functional specificity and yet it's functional specificity is not in it so this idea that I'm taking out kind of a popular 322 set of course we have specialist components so for example from a textbook very complex traits were associated with the script brain regions modern research was really nice that a single bring me bring regionally participated more than one function in the Hedge workmate so we can really have a fight but it was found it stick out this different view Lisa Feldman Barrett I haven't met her but she's driving me insane most recently by proclaiming all kinds of things at the New York Times just a few weeks ago quote in general the given region has a distinct psychological purpose right well she's in general but she's basically which is reasoning from the fact that suggested specific emotions don't inhabits Pacific brain regions from the idea that the whole brain has nowhere position of function well that's ok so I hope that he will stop is pastels arguments because my favourite this old coot all I know this on the web and here I am caring let's go cracked me up in publishing kind of going after a function rain any studies using green images that reports single areas of activation exclusively associated with a particular cognitive process should be considered to be artefact of the arbitrary threshold set by the investigators and seriously question so anyway anyway my point is just the we shouldn't get in the theatre proclaimer opinions that are that speak to it so let me show you some of mine ok so what would be evidence of functional specificity of ways of doing it the way I like to do it is something called the functional region of interest method the the problem is that all there very systematic regularities in the functional organisation of the brain each of these regions approximately the same location in each normal subject the actual location varies a bit from subject to subject so if you do the standard thing of a whining brains and averaged across of you get a lot of Marsh and yet there isn't much Marsh in each subject individually and soda deal with that problem it's a bit of the bunch of other problems we have something called the functional regions of interest method and that means if you want to study a given region you find it in that subject individually and then once you found it it with a simple contrast you want to find a face region you find a region that responds well when people look at this is them when they look it up Jax now you've found it in that subject it's these 85 boxes right there and that subject now we run a new experiment to test more interesting questions about it and we never the response in those boxes that also has the advantage that the date are you plant and look at is independent of the way of found this fox also very important problem in a lot of functional imaging were people have non-independent statistical problems with the date analysis if you have a functional region of interest that's localised independently of the day to look at in it you get out of that problem it's also a huge benefits as one of the central problems with functional brain imaging which I think is lead to the fact that a large percent of the publisher imaging findings are probably noise is it is too many degrees of freedom you have tens of thousands of fossils you have a lose of different places to look and ways to analyse your day one of the things I love dearly about the console region-of-interest method is that you tie your hands in a really good way right so your ears best wine Avance exactly where you're going to look and his specify exactly how you're going to quantify the response and see you have no degrees of freedom and I'll give you a huge statistical advantage and it needs a less likely to be inadvertently publishing papers on nose ok so that's the method here is just we've done loads of these experiments he's just from a current experiment I think conducted by Zeinab vegan she's actually looking at conductivity of different brand regions using a different methods I probably won't have time to talk about it's very cool but in the process she's run a whole bunch of function localises and so we can look at her Dieter at the response of the fusiform face area conditions ok so these are a bunch of auditory language-conditioned so ok not too surprising it doesn't respond very much to those who presented auditorily but these are all diesel stimuli hear the two yellow bars are faces this is line drawings of faces this is video clips colour video clips of faces from responses to both and all of these other conditions line drawings of objects movies of object movies of seen scrambled objects word scrambles words bodies Albury it is much lower responses so I would say this is pretty strong selectivity it's been tested against the laws of alternatives only a tiny presented which are shown here as I mentioned before more or less the same place and pretty much every normal subject I think it's just basic types of mental architecture now this is a very simple University at measure we're just measuring the very crude thing of the overall magnitude of Emma a response in that region to these conditions there are legitimate counter arguments to the simple-minded you I'm putting Force and we should consider them I think the most important one comes from pattern analysis methods which I will talk about if I get there and importantly these data don't tell us about the possible that region will return to those however the point is before we Blakely say it's not fashionable to talk about punctual specificity counter arguments today like this so pretty strong and they know there's just one example to show you just a few others from paper ok so this is what I just showed you but I'm in the experiment we can look at other regions of this is a bottom surface of the of the brain there so this is a acceptable pool front of the head bottom of the temporal lobe that they Siri is the region in yellow in the subject this purple region is that visual word for area that I mentioned in here as it's response magnitude of subjects localising an independently testing the purple bars are when sorry subjects are looking at who presented words and again all these other conditions faces objects bodies scenes no listening to words all of those things much lower response ok in the same experiment we can also look at a set of regions that respond to speech I meant and was very briefly and my introduction few days ago these are regions a number of people of found in this case what we immediately below lateral to primary auditory cortex in humans interesting which way to break between primary auditory cortex and language sensitive regions rate between is a set of regions that respond to the sounds of speech Ok content of language with the sounds of speech and so this is when people are just people are saying stuff like butt and ears when they're tapping their fingers and a systematic order here is it listening to sentences importantly this is when they're listening to Jabberwocky garlic that's meaningless ok so no meaning but phonemes same response that's what tells us that this region is involved in processing the sounds of speed not the content of language and load everything else so other things moving outside of perception Regency might ok fine perception as an inherently modular process of different kinds of perceptional problems that make sense but high-level cognition we wouldn't really have function specificity for that but oh yes we do here are some language regions there's a bunch of them in the temporal and frontal lobe that I've been known since wernicke and broke her but now with functional MRI we can identify them in individual subjects and go back and repeatedly query them and say are the involved in all of these other mental processes so this is now the response in a language Regency identified as a response when you're listening to sentences this is when you're listening to Jabberwocky nonsense strings here's when you're saying but I gotta go it's not just speech sounds years when you're listening to synthetically decompose speech sounds that are acoustically very similar to the Jabberwocky speech it's just not interested in those things it seems to be interested in something more like the meaning of and just to show you some other day do we have on this this is data from a Federico who has tested this region Elsa sort of roughly broca's area on the main mental functions that people have argued overlap in the brain with language nearly sorry so probably her to see here but arithmetic so we have difficult and easy mental arithmetic intact and scrambled music and pink a bunch of working memory tasks special working memory and variable working memory and a bunch of cognitive control that's kind of attention demanding Tas where you have to switch between Tas and stuff like that and here is the response profile in that region reading sentences reading on board strings all of those other tasks but the difficult in the easy version no response at all that's extreme functional specificity everything there is more to be done but the first pass querying of those language and all these other things that people fortnite overlap of language the answer is no later an interest and I think that's really deep and an interesting cos it means that you know this this basic question that we all do not start asking ourselves When We Were Young is what is the relationship between language and thought it was disagrees with me somewhere on this that's good she's very articulated she doesn't feel the difference between an idea and it's articulation I'm less articulate and it's very obvious to me the different things and discussed but I think there is a best golf between the two and that all many different aspects of cognition procedures fine without language regions and actually the stronger evidence for that comes not from these functions Lima I did it's breaking as I think they are but from patient data so Rosemary barley in England has been testing patients with global aphasia this is very tragic horrible thing that happens in patients who have massive left hemisphere strokes that pretty much take out change the Oliver language abilities those people she has shown are intact in their navigation abilities their arithmetic abilities their ability to solve logic problems their ability to think about what other people are thinking their ability to appreciate music and so on and so far so I think that's really a very big difference between a major part of the system that you need to understand the meaning of a sentence and all of those other aspects of thought this was just showing you what I mean by function specificity what the evidence for the basic further evidence is and these are just the Regency we happen have in the study so I could make a new fly but her wants of other perceptual and cognitive functions people have found quite specific brain regions for perceiving bodies and scenes of course motion the area and he's been studied for a long time regions that are quote quote specifically involved in processing shape we've been studying colour process Kitchens recently there's not a selected for colour as some of these other regions with the very anatomically consistent and things I mentioned before my brief introduction regions that are specifically involved in processing pitch information and use a confirmation and it still here next week from a Rebecca sax theory of mind or thinking about other people farts and so there's quite a litany of of mental functions that have brain regions that are quite specifically engaged that mental functions and each of these to varying degrees but you know some appreciable degree have corroborating evidence from patients who have that specific deficit so that shows that each of these has is likely to be activated during but causally involved in it's Mental functions and as I mentioned there are actually good counter arguments to some of the things I've been making that are worth discussing I think the pattern analysis stata is the strongest to say in a roughly where we are now the counter arguments but list talk about her there's no localisation of function in the brain he got engaged with this effort and give me a serious Connor organ it ok to say that it's not like this there are there the big grey paint as we haven't figured out what it's doing with her also substantial patches that are already been shown to be in some sense the opposite of this you can almost any difficult task you do at all and I think there's a very interesting part of the whole story of the architecture of intelligence I'm going to take 5 minutes and tell you about it this work is primarily the work of John Duncan in England and he's been pointing out for about 15 years but there are reasons in the frontal lobe that are engaged in pretty much any difficult task until anytime you increase the difficulty of a task whether it's perceptual or high-level cognitive those regions turn on differentially until that's because some of them and their response of multiple different kinds of demand so so remember Spearman why started with who talks about the general Factor basically this is the seat of these regions here to his argument that and what is strongly activated when you do a classic g loading house that's not that surprising their activity more interestingly patient study where they found idea so patients in their Northside patients in the database and they identified the low focus of the brain damage in each of those patients post-injury IQ they estimated from a variety of sources pre-injury IQ and they asked how much does your IQ go down after brain damage as a function of 1 the volume of tissue you lost your brain damage and to the Locus tissue and if you're in these regions your IQ goes down if you will stay issue elsewhere you may become paralysed or a physical or Proserpine nosek you don't lose your cute as knuckle down and kind of ghoulish calculation but you lose points for every 10 cubic centimetres of this region of Cortex and almost nothing for the rest of the brain so this is kind of crude perfect what you can get from patients but I think it intriguing and so his suggestion is that in addition to these highly specialised cortical regions that we use for these these particular importance house we also have this kind of general purpose machinery that makes us generically smart and I'm Gonna Leave tested this more seriously analyses for channel like we did it in collaboration with him with individuals project analysis is the most precise measurements we could make and boys he write a mini even to the box or you can find these regions are engaged in seven or eight very very different kinds of cognitive demand all activate the same fossil differentially so the basic story I'm putting forth year without the I'm sorry about that is that is that macroscale the architecture of human intelligence if we have the special purpose bits for a small is number of important mental functions not all of them and maybe some of them in addition we have some general purpose there's no more that we don't know from the precise competitions at go on in these things to their conductivity to the actual precise representations you can see with the normal code if you could measure it which WikiCamps in humans to the timing of the interactions which of them are uniquely human which of them are also present in monkeys and I don't but what are the things we've been doing recently is looking in the ventral visual pathway at the organisation of face place and cold selectivity and what we see is that weird me and bubble Conway and Russell Russell episode bevel in rose I had previously shown that on the lateral surface in the monkey you have three bands of selectivity so it goes the selectivity and selectivity play story of the three bands on the side of the temple open monkeys in humans the same organisation in the same but it's rolled around on the ventral surface of the brain in the same order face colour place on the bottom of the brain is between monkeys and humans on the bottom and that's not exactly another argument actually been referred to people suggesting this a while back and I think you're starting to see those emojis in the reason it's important is it all these questions we desperately want to answer a belt the in a causal role conductivity population codes interactions between regions development over that we can't answer very well and humans can answer in monkeys and after break
