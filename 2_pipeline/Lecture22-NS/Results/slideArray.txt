* Electrical recordings in the brain are made
with electrodes.

* Recordings can be made inside of single cells

* Most often, in behaving animals, recordings
are made of signals outside of neurons.
ENDELEMENTElectrical recordings of brain activity

What is the origin of ‘extracellular’ electrical signals?

Voltage measurements are always
voltage differences

Extracellular voltages are always
measured between the signal
electrode and a local ground or
reference electrode.

Voltage differences between the
signal and ground electrode are
always associated with current flow
through the extracellular space.

Let's start with our spherical neuron

There is no spatial separation between
current flows into the neuron and current
flow out of the neuron. Thus, no current intracellular
flow outside the neuron.

And thus no extracellular voltage changes! extracellular

MILLISECONDS

The firing rate is rapidly modulated in time.
ENDELEMENTRate vs timing?

* Sensory neurons spike more in response to some stimuli than others
Motor neurons spike more before or during some actions than others

 

Therefore, information about a stimulus (or motor action) is carried in the
numbers of spikes generated.

 

* All neurons exhibit temporal modulation of their firing rate (or spiking
probability per unit time).

 

If information is carried in the slow modulations spike probability, we say
that the information is coded by firing rate.

‘Rate coding’

 

 

(— If information is carried in the fast modulations in spike probability, we say
the the information is coded by spike timing.

 

‘Temporal coding’

 

 
ENDELEMENTRate vs timing?

You may occasionally hear a debate about ‘rate coding’ vs.
‘temporal coding’.

This is a false dichotomy. These are two extremes along a
spectrum.

The brain uses information in spike trains at a fast timescale and
at a slow timescale.

How do we determine what timescales are important?

We look at what the downstream neurons do with these spikes!

> What timescale is relevant for the computation being done?

> What are the biophysical processes in the downstream neurons.
