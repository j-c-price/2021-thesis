ways\nI'm going to connect\nto what Jim DiCarlo\nwas talking about today\nand what Nancy\ntalked about today.\nI just thought\npreparing for this\nthat I should say a few things\nabout primates and intelligence\nand how face recognition\nmight be connected\nboth to the species\nwe are studying\nand to the overall\nquestion of intelligence.\nAnd I thought the\nmost appropriate thing\nto do this at MBL\nwould be to start\nwith this kind of creature.\nSo you might have seen\nin the paper Nature that"], "50": [1, 50, "that the genome of the\noctopus was sequenced.\nIt was really heralded\nin the public press\nthat it's finally proving\ntheir intelligence.\nThe argument is that\nthere are 33,000 genes,\n10,000 more than humans.\nThat's of course not a\nvery strong argument.\nThere are plants\nwith 45,000 genes.\nSo that really doesn't tell you\nvery much about intelligence.\nBut amongst those\ngenes that were found\nwere lots of genes that are\nimportant for development\nof the brain.\nAnd there is very\nhigh heterogeneity\nin certain gene families that\nare controlling the development\nof the nervous system.\nSo it's one example of\nhow a better understanding\nthe intelligence of other\ncreatures in neural terms,\neven in creatures like the\noctopus which is very difficult\nto study.\nThe point I would like to\nstress about the octopus\nis there's really nothing\nsocial about the species.\nActually almost simultaneously\nwith this paper,"], "100": [2, 70, "in one particular species of\noctopus where it's not clear\nif it's violence\nor more affection.\nBut this is really\nthe one exception\nto otherwise a life that's\npretty much non-social at all.\nSo in the octopus you have\nthe egg stage and then\nthis larva which are\nhatching very early on.\nThere's no interaction with\nmom or anything like this.\nThey go to the\nsurface of the ocean\nand they start feeding and try\nto grow as fast as they can\nbecause only a few of\nthem are going to survive.\nThen reproduction is a\nvery scary enterprise.\nIn many octopus,\nthe male has to be\ncareful not to be eaten by\nthe female in the process.\nWhen it's successful, then\nactually the male stops eating.\nHe's going to die even\nbefore most of the youngsters\nare going to hatch.\nAnd all that mom is going to\ndo is basically to make sure\nthat fresh water is going\nto be delivered to the eggs.\nAnd that's it in\nterms of social life.\nSo you can be very intelligent\nlike an octopus and, who knows,\nGabriel just mentioned\nextraterrestrial life.\nMaybe other species out there\nmight also not be that social.\nAnd so there doesn't\nnecessarily have\nto be a connection between\nsociality and intelligence.\nSecond thing is it\ncan be very social,"], "170": [3, 20, "and you get lots of\nprotection being in the group,\nbut following your\ninstincts in this way\ndoesn't necessarily\nmake you very smart.\nSo I don't want to argue\nagainst the connection\nbetween sociality\nand intelligence\nin the form of\nsocial intelligence.\nBut we have to be careful\nthere's no necessary connection\nbetween those.\nHowever for primates\nthere is this idea,"], "190": [4, 20, "that really what made\nprimates so intelligent\nis their sociality.\nAnd so let's consider a little\nbit what the arguments are.\nIt was most strongly put\nforward by Nick Humphrey in '76,\nbut there are similar\nprecursors to this idea.\nSo who are these primates?\nThe primates are a\nsmall group of mammals"], "210": [5, 70, "They're very diverse.\nYou can have very\nsmall primates,\njust 30 grams, all the way\nto 200 kilogram animals.\nThey evolved, studying\n65, 85 million years ago,\nthere was this mass extinction.\nAnd so you have this high\ndiversity within the mammals\nstarting from this point on.\nSo they have certain things\nin common with other mammals,\nbut they're also very\nspecial in many ways.\nAll of the primate\nspecies are social.\nThey're not [INAUDIBLE]\nsocial, but they are social.\nThey develop very slowly.\nSo it's really very\ndifferent from the octopus.\nA lot of investment is made\ninto the offspring There are not\nvery many offspring.\nAnd the lifespan of these\nanimals is pretty long.\nThe octopus life span\nis three to five years.\nThey're very visual,\nrather than other mammals,\nwhich are very\nolfactory oriented.\nThey have binocular vision,\nmany have color vision,\nso vision is very\nimportant for primates.\nAnd they have on average larger\nbrains than other mammals have.\nSo our understanding of\nthe anatomy of primates\nand what makes this special\nis actually very rudimentary.\nBut there are a few points\nthat should be of interest.\nSo if you look at\nthe mammalian brains,\nobviously they're very, very\ncomplex mammalian brains.\nThey're not primate\n[INAUDIBLE] ones.\nAnd the main factor\nreally is body mass."], "280": [6, 10, "elementary of body weight\nversus brain weight.\nAnd you can see there's\na log-log relationship\nbetween the two."], "290": [7, 10, "But if you compare primates\nto other non-primate mammals\nyou can see that there\nis a larger increase"], "300": [8, 10, "And if you count the number of\nneurons, the number of brain\nneurons, it is increasing\nmore steeply with body mass\nthan it is in other mammals.\nThis is obviously a\nvery crude measurement."], "310": [9, 10, "If you look for brains\nroughly the same weight,\nyou can again see\nlike in primates, you\nhave many more neurons\nthan in non-primates\njust by these two examples here."], "320": [10, 50, "There are other measures\nyou can look at.\nSo for example, the\nneuron size is increasing\nwith brain size in rodents.\nSo a larger brain\nin rodents is not\nnecessarily one that\nhas many more neurons,\nbut these neurons are\njust getting bigger.\nAnd in primates this is\nreally not so much the case.\nSo the size of the\nneuron pretty much\nstays constant even if you\ndecrease the size of the brain.\nOr how much white matter do\nyou actually need per neuron\nto connect other brain regions?\nIn rodents, apparently\nthe fiber caliber\nis increasing with brain size.\nSo again, your brain\nmight grow just\nbecause the anatomy\nof the basic element\nrequires that it\nwill need more space.\nBut in primates\nthat's not the case.\nIf you get more\nwhite brain matter,\nthat's likely because the\nconnectivity is more complex.\nPrimate brains also fold\nfaster with increasing size\nthan rodent neurons.\nSo these are all just\nvery coarse indications\nthat maybe there's\nsomething special"], "370": [11, 20, "So along the anatomy, I\nmentioned that primates\nhave forward-facing eyes.\nThey can do binocular vision,\nthey have color vision.\nThey have skulls\nwith a large cranium,\nthat's something that makes\nthem special from other mammals.\nThey're also special in other\nways that are important.\nIf you think about\nembodied cognition,"], "390": [12, 80, "but obviously if you have\na hand as complex as ours\nwhich we share with\nmany primate species,\nthere are lots of\nthings you can do.\nAnd that requires you to\nbe able to control it.\nAnd this gives you a power to\ninteract with the environment\nthat other animals\nmight not have.\nSo the shoulder is\nmore mobile, there's\nan opposable thumb\nin many species.\nAnd then in the face, there are\nchanges that you might already\nhave seen here.\nSo if you go up to the\nmore complex animals,\nthe snout region is becoming\nincreasingly reduced.\nAnd I will tell you later\nwhy this might be important.\nSo these are anatomical\nspecialization in primates.\nSociality is very\nimportant as well.\nAnd so there are four main\norganizational principles\nof sociality in primates.\nThe dominating one is\nthe second one here.\nIt's called the male\ntransfer system.\nSo it's a polygamous,\nmulti-male organization.\nThis is very important for\nthe social life of primates\nbecause what it means is\nthat the social behavior has\nto be complex.\nSo there can be cooperation,\nlike grooming, defense,\nand hunting which all\nthe animals of a troop\nmight engage in.\nBut at the same time there's\ncompetition for food,\nmates dominance, hierarchies.\nAnd it's a function\nof the complexity\nof the social environment.\nSo primate social\nlife was beautifully\ninscribed by Dorothy\nCheney and Robert Seyfarth\nin this wonderful book\nBaboon Metaphysics.\nAnd I'm just going\nto quote from that.\nSo they studied baboon\nmonkeys in the wild and here's"], "470": [13, 80, "\"The domain of expertise\nfor baboons, and indeed\nfor all monkeys and\napes, is social life.\nMost baboons live in multi-male\nand multi-female groups\nthat typically include eight\nor nine metrolineal families.\"\nWhich means that the\nfemales stay in the group\nand they found\nfamilies and they're\ngoing to stay constant\nover a long period of time.\n\"They have a linear\ndominance hierarchy\nof males the changes often and\nthe linear hierarchy of females\nand the offsprings that can\nbe stable for generations.\nDaily life in a baboon group\nincludes small scale alliances\nthat may involve only\nthree individuals\nand occasional large scale\nfamiliar battles that\ninvolve all of the members\nof three or four metrolines.\nMales and females can\nform short term bonds that\nlead to reproduction, or longer\nterm friendships that lead\nto cooperative child rearing.\"\n\"The result of all\nthis social intrigue\nis a kind of Jane\nAusten melodrama\nin which each individual must\npredict the behavior of others\nand form those\nrelationships that\nreturn the greatest benefits.\nThese are the problems that\nthe baboon mind must solve\nand this is the environment\nin which it has evolved.\"\nMost of the problems\nfacing baboons\ncan be expressed in two\nwords: other baboons.\nAnd so this is really important.\nSo again, if you're social\nyou don't necessarily\nhave to be very smart.\nYou can be very smart\nand not be social.\nBut there's something\nspecial apparently\nabout primates that links our\nintelligence to our sociality."], "550": [14, 200, "what works in its favor is that\nthe primates have large brains.\nAnd primates,\napparently group size\nis correlated with brain size\nacross different species,\nand not the home-range size.\nThis is an\nalternative hypothesis\nis that maybe you have to forage\nin more complex environments.\nAnd so a similar proxy\nfor the complexity\nof your social life\nand your physical life\npredicts there's a\nbetter correlation\nof brain size with the social\nlife than physical life.\nThe complexity of\nan individual's\nsocial relationships increases\nexponentially with group size.\nAnd groups are not small.\nAnd we're going to get back\nto this point in a little bit.\nThe baboons and other primates\nknow their peer's dominance,\nrank, and social relations.\nEverything that I mentioned\nin the previous slide\nis good evidence\nfor behavioral work\nthat actually primates\nknow something about it.\nThis social knowledge\ncontrasts with surprising cases\nof ignorance outside\nof the social domain.\nEven when it's something\nas important as a predator.\nSo Cheney and Seyfard, they\nalso studied vervet monkeys.\nAnd what they observed\nis that vervet monkeys,\none of the main predators\nto them is a python.\nAnd the python, if\nit crawls in the sand\nit leaves behind a trail.\nAnd there is absolutely no\nindication that the vervet\nmonkeys make the connection\nbetween these trails\nand the presence of the python.\nWhich is really\nstriking, you would\nimagine this is the first thing\nthat they would have to learn.\nSo there are cases\nwhere they actually\nfollow the trail into the bush\nand they're very surprised\nto find a python there.\nAnother example\nis, are leopards.\nSo in the environment,\nleopards are\nof course predators who also\nfeed on the vervet monkeys.\nLeopards have a way of putting\nthe carcasses of animals\nthey hunted down into the trees\nto protect them from larger\npredators like lions.\nSo the presence of a\ncarcass would actually\nindicate to you that likely\nthere is a leopard around.\nAnd again, the\nvervet monkeys they\ndon't make that connection.\nSo if there is a\ncarcas there, they're\nnot particularly\nscared about it.\nIt doesn't mean that\nthey're ignorant.\nSo they're even following\nalarm calls from other species\nas to whether an\neagle is approaching,\nor if cattle is approaching.\nSo it's not that they're\ngenerally dumb in this way,\nbut there's really this very big\ncontrast about all the details\nthat they know about their\nsocial world and the obliviance\nthat they can express\nfor non-social factors.\nThen we have\nspecializations, we're\ngoing to talk about this\nin the brain for processing\nsocial stimuli.\nAnd then there's\nactually evidence\nthat females who have better\nsocial abilities, that they\nare less stressed and they have\nbetter reproductive success.\nAnd so this all works to\nsay that if you are socially\nsmart in a baboon environment\nor in the environment\nof many primate species,\nyou actually have\nbetter success of reproducing.\nTherefore there's\na good argument\nto be made that your social\nintelligence will therefore\ngo to the next generation.\nThis is how social\nintelligence might improve.\nI think there's one\nimportant point that's\noftentimes not made.\nAnd that's if you become smarter\nand smarter in interacting\nwith your physical environment,\nyour physical environment\ndoes not change very much.\nBut if you are interacting\nwith a social environment,\nand getting smarter\nand smarter interacting\nwith the social\nenvironment, the elements\nin your social environment\nyou're interacting with,\nthey're also getting\nsmarter and smarter.\nSo you're actually\nsetting forth an arms race\nwhere you're not only improving\nthe situation by getting\nsmarter, but we\nhave to get smart\nin order to keep pace with the\nothers who are outsmarting you.\nAnd so you can see\nhow there could\nbe a connection between\nsociality and intelligence.\nThat there's really\nthis arms race\ndoes not occur for\nphysical interactions\nbut for social interactions.\nSo that you actually have\nto be able to better predict\nthe next move of someone\nelse in your group\nand you have to know something\nabout that individual for you\nto be successful.\nSo there are arguments against\nthe Social Intelligence"], "750": [15, 60, "about many other species.\nSo there are other social\nspecies, hyenas for example\nhave complex societies, but\nhyenas have not been studied\nas much as monkeys have.\nWe also don't know\nabout the complexity,\nmostly for this reason,\nwhere they're really\ncompared to whales,\nwhales for example,\nprimate societies\nare more complex.\nAnd this of course would\nbe a crucial conjecture\nof this Social\nIntelligence Hypothesis.\nThen within the\nprimate orders, there\nare actually some\nother correlations\nthat do predict\nbrain size very well.\nAnd so within the primate order,\nsocial learning, innovation,\nand tool use are strongly\ncorrelated with brain size\nand not with group size.\nSo you could imagine a scenario\nwhere actually the evolution\nof basic, social\nintelligence is something\nthat's very basic to primates.\nBut then if you go\nto different species\nwithin the primate\norder and ask like why\ndid they become so smart,\nlike orangutans or chimps who\ncan use tools, then\nit really might\nbe the tool use that\nwould be of more\nimportance than the sociality.\nSo I have a movie here that\nactually illustrates these two\ndifferent hypotheses."], "810": [16, 30, "of Tonkin macaque monkeys.\nYou can see the\nfacial displays, you\ncan see that they are\ntending to each other.\nAnd well you might think that\nthey are trying to figure out\nwhat's actually going on here.\nAnd here's the alternative\nhypothesis of this.\nThis is tool use.\nSo you can see this guy\njust invented a cool tool,\na nose pick.\nAnd so it's anyone's\nguess what's\nmore important to\nyour intelligence,\nyou been able to read\nthe social significance\nof other individuals\nin your troop\nor your ability to\ninvent a nice nose pick."], "840": [17, 10, "So are the primates' abilities\nin social knowledge really\nintelligent or is\nit just more like\nidiot savant-like abilities?"], "850": [18, 100, "The argument that Cheney and\nSeyfard made is the following.\nSo the knowledge that\nthey have should actually\nbe true knowledge and just\nnot learned associations.\nAnd the reason has to\ndo with the complexity\nof the social environment.\nIf you have 80 different\nindividuals, which\nis the typical case for\nthese baboon monkeys,\nyou have 3,160 pairs of\nanimals and 82,160 trails.\nIt's going to be\nvirtually impossible\nfor you to learn all\nthese different pairwise\nrelationships and then behave\nintelligently based upon it.\nSecond, these relationships\ncan change very fast.\nSo it would not be very\nsmart to try and make\na list of all these\npairwise interactions\nand then act upon that.\nNo single behavioral\nmetric seems\nto be necessary or sufficient\nto recognize associations\nlike matrilinear kin.\nSo human observers\nare apparently not\nvery good to predict this if\nthey don't know the animals\nvery well personally.\nThen you might think,\nwell, maybe it's\nnot physically like a\nlist but you don't really\nlearn this much and you\napply a simple rule to it.\nAnd that also doesn't\nseem to work very well\nbecause social relationships\nlike friendships,\nthey are intransitive.\nSo if A and B are\nfriends, B and C\nare friends, that doesn't\nmean that A and C necessarily\nhave to be friends.\nOthers like family\nrelationships are complex,\nthey're non-associative.\nSo if A is the mother\nof B, that actually\nmeans that B is not\nthe mother of A.\nSo there's a more complex\ninteraction there as well.\nAnd then finally, there can\nbe simultaneous membership\nin multiple classes.\nAnd again, for you to be\nable to keep track of this,\nyou better have\na cognitive model\nof what's going on rather than\njust a list of associations\nthat you learned.\nIt's very difficult\nin experimentation\nto prove it's not\nassociation, but I\nthink these are very good\narguments to consider\nthat actually these primates\nhave active knowledge\nof their social environment.\nSo there's one example for\nthis where you can actually\nmake the point very nicely."], "950": [19, 20, "Ahla is a baboon monkey\nand she was actually\nliving with farmers\nin South West Africa.\nSo there was a habit at the\ntime to actually replace\ndogs who were herding\ngoats with baboons.\nAnd so you can see\nAhla sitting here."], "970": [20, 50, "of the behavior of the goats.\nSo she's licking salt here,\nwhich is something that baboons\nwould naturally not do.\nShe would continue to engage\nin social behaviors that\nare typical for baboons.\nSo she would groom the\ngoats, for example.\nBut the most amazing\nthing about her,\nwhich is a little hard to\nsee as you see her here,\nshe's carrying one of the\nlittle yearlings here,\nand brings it to its mother.\nAnd the description of\nwhat this animal was doing\nwas when the goats\nwere brought home\nand then sometimes they were\nseparating the mother goats\nfrom the offspring, she would\nactually go manic and then\ntry to pair them up\nand she would not\nstop until she was finished.\nAnd this would even\nhappen as multiple goats\nwere calling for the\nyearlings and then vise versa.\nAnd so she would have to put\norder into the social world\nthat she was living in\nand she wouldn't stop\nuntil this order was restored."], "1020": [21, 10, "able to tell any of the\nadult goals or the yearlings\nor know any of the pairs.\nBut this was like her world.\nThis was like a social\nenvironment that she was in\nand she would\nstructure it according"], "1030": [22, 50, "So the point is\nthat primates have\nintricate social knowledge.\nSo they know about the\nstatus of individuals,\nlike their age or their gender.\nThey know about the\ninteractions of individuals.\nThey recognize them very simply\nlike grooming and mothering.\nAnd then based on\nthese observations\nof the different individuals\nin the social world,\nthey built these\ncognitive structures\nlike friendship,\nkinship, and hierarchy,\nhave an interesting,\ncomplicated structure to them.\nAll of this is rooted in\nthe concept of the person.\nAnd this is very\nimportant and as I'm\ngoing to be talking\nabout face recognition,\nI have to emphasize these\nare two different things.\nYou can recognize a\nperson from their face,\nbut if you can\nrecognize a face it\ndoesn't mean that you know who\nit is, who is behind the face.\nSo the person concept would\ninclude something like this.\nIt's a juvenile, female monkey.\nIt's the daughter of x\nand so on and so forth.\nSo this is knowledge\nthat we have."], "1080": [23, 20, "that we work with,\nthat they actually\nhave this person knowledge.\nSo why do we study faces?\nSo for us faces really\nare the ideal

primate brain\nis thought to be involved\nin visual function.\nSo this is a lot.\nAnd this is\ntestament to the fact\nthat there's a\nlot of information\nto be gathered from the\noutside visual

30, "So what is an object?\nSo Jim was saying that it's\nthe basic unit of cognition.\nAnd just very quickly,\nwhat it actually is it's\nmore than a collection\nof features.\nSo the Gestalt\nRules of Perception\nactually emphasize this.\nSo if you have proximity\nof elements, you group\nthem together.\nIf these elements\nshare similarity,\nyou group them together\nto larger entities.\nIf there's

have different\nface parts, then"], "1150": [26, 30, "correctly, you can\nsuddenly recognize a face.\nSo there's a larger\nscale organization to not\nthat goes beyond just being\na collection of features.\nAnd maybe something similar\nis going on for a higher order\ncondition that I'm sure other\npeople are going to talk about.\nAnd it's in the\nphysical interactions,\nwe infer causality from\njust the sequence of events.\nOr social interactions,\nlike in Heider-Simmel movies\nwhere you are telling yourself\na complex social story\nunfold even when\nthere's just simple,\ngeometric

now\nattaching to the skin.\nAnd so if you look at these two\nrats here where their whiskers,\nI hope you can see it here,\nin the end are labeled.\nYou can see they're actively\nexploring each

some\nsimpler primates\nwhere there's still\na strong snout, which\nis limiting the ability\nof the face to move.\nBut the more complex the primate\nis getting, the more flexible\nthese muscles become\nand the more expressive\nthe faces become.\nSo the face now becomes richer\nand richer with social signals\nthat can read out."], "1310": [32, 10, "you have a fixed set\nof facial

acting on\nin an automatic fashion.\nBut this emotional part I\nthink is really important.\nIt's just at a\ncertain point that you\ncan't control these things.\nFaces really get very deep into\nyour emotional and social brain\nautomatically.\nAnd so one of the lines\nof research in my lab\nis to try to figure\nout the circuits\nthat make that possible\nand then to use\nthis to get an inroad into\nthe social brain of function\nbeyond face perception."], "1400": [34, 20, "you recognize Charles\nDarwin, so it's identity,\nthey're getting their\nsocial communication,\nthere's emotional

going to work.\nSo in this area AL was more\nanterior, also virtually\nall of the cells\nare face selective.\nBut you have a property\nemerge here which\nyou didn't have before.\nAnd that is mere\nsymmetric confusion.\nAnd it's something\nthat we did not expect.\nWe're still puzzled by it.\nWe have no explanation\nwhy it's happening.\nBut in this area you have\ncells that like a profile view.\nAnd if they like\none profile view,\nthey also like the\nopposite profile view.\nAnd this region here as\nI mentioned initially\nthat some of the cells\ndid not really seem to be\nface selective.\nIt's a small percentage.\nBut actually these cells are\nselective for facial profile.\nBut if they like one profile\nright, they don't like left.\nIf they like left,\nthey don't like right.\nIn AL, this is being confused.\nAnd then if you go\nto AM, you have cells\nthat respond to all faces.\nIt doesn't matter\nwhere they are,\ndoesn't matter who\nthey are, doesn't\nmatter how big they are.\nAnd the other cells that also\ndon't care where they are\nand how big they are,\nbut they care exquisitely\nabout identity.\nSo they can be very,\nvery finely tuned\nto identity in\nparticular to people\nthat the animals never\nsee in real life."], "2920": [77, 100, "to here where in Jim\nDiCarlo's conceptual framework\nyou could imagine that there's\na manifold that's now becoming\nsort of flatter and more like\na more explicit representation.\nAnd for some reason\ncreating this\nhas to go through this\nmirror symmetric confusion.\nI just want to highlight.\nSo we meant to touch\nupon the question\nwhether a face area should\ndo different coputations\nfrom non-face areas.\nActually, my\nintuition about this\nwas actually quite the opposite.\nSo I thought they would\nlikely do the same computation\nor hopefully the\nsame computations\nas outside the areas just\nin different material.\nSo why in other non-face areas?\nWhy don't you want\nto mix these cells?\nWe have one study that's\na little too complicated\nto explain here that\ngives some clues.\nBut some computation\nwork from Joel Leibo\nwas a grad student\nwith Tommy actually\ngave some clues to that.\nSo Joel and Tommy were\nthinking about invariance.\nAnd Tommy told me\nhe's going to talk\nabout this at some later\npoint in the course.\nThe different kinds of\ntransformations, easy ones\nand difficult ones.\nThe easy ones are\naffine transformations.\nWe're just shifting something\nin space or in size,\nor we rotate it in plane.\nAnd so if you learn\nhow to correct\nfor this transformation for\njust three dots of light,\nyou can look for any image\nthat you can ever see.\nSo this is relatively easy.\nBut then they're non-affine\ntransformations that\nare actually\nchanging the picture\nand they are very\ndifficult. So if you\nchange your facial\nexpression for example,\nor if lighting\nconditions are changing,\nor if you're turning\nyour head in depth,\nthis is a non-affine\ntransformation.\nSo it's not predictable\nfrom just three dots.\nAnd you can learn\nsomething there\nthat could tell you\nhow this picture would\nlook like under this\nnon-affine transformation.\nAnd one of the insights from\nJoel was that if you learn this\nnon-affine transformation on\na particular object category--"], "3020": [78, 90, "you actually have learned\nnothing about another object\ncategory like cars.\nThat's actually quite\nsurprising to me\nbut there could be\na reason why you\nmight want to have\nall the cells that\nhave to learn representations\nacross one transformation put\nthem all in one location.\nThe second insight\nthey had, and I\nthink it's still\nvery surprising to me\nthat it actually\nworks so easily,\nis to give the computation\na count for the system\nthat I just described to\nyou in qualitative terms.\nSo we have three\nlevels of processing.\nSo we have a front\nend where cells\nare useful for face\ndetection, they're\nall very face selective.\nSo you could think of this\nlike a three level processing\nhierarchy where the level one\nis like a face filter that's\njust going to tell you\nit's their face or not.\nThe top level you want\nan identification.\nAnd I didn't show\nthe examples, again\nI hope with a connection\nto the monitor I\ncan show you the actual movies.\nYou have some cells that\nare very, very finely\nselective of facial identity.\nWith pattern readout\ntechniques you\ncan read out identity\nextremely reliably.\nIf you now have like\nHebbian Learning Rule,\nmaybe Tommy is going to\nexplain this to you more,\nyou actually get\nsomething pretty magic.\nSo you do get invariance\nat level number three,\nwhich is kind of what you wanted\nand might not be surprised by.\nBut as a byproduct, you\nare getting mirror symmetry\nat level two.\nAnd that's something you\ndidn't stick into the system\nand it just happens,\nnot like magic,\nbut there's an\nexplanation for why\nthis happens, out of\nvery general assumptions\nabout the system.\nSo the point I\nwant to make here,\nthis particular\nmodel could be wrong,\nbut it's something about\nhow knowing something\nabout the overall\norganization of the system"], "3110": [79, 20, "might not think about.\nSo the fact that there are\nthree levels of processing\nand not four or five\nor six might actually\nimpact whether you find\nmirror symmetry or not.\nOr whether you find\nmirrir symmetry\nat one level or another level.\nAnd you don't necessarily\nget this automatically.\nJust put any processing\nsystem together.\nBecuase I was mentioning\na facial motion,"], "3130": [80, 50, "And so I was emphasizing\nhere transformations\nalong this direction.\nBut you can see that at least\ntwo levels of processing\nthere are actually\ntwo face areas here,\none lateral to the STS, and\nthe other one deep inside.\nAnd so one of the questions we\nhad was what's going on here?\nHow are they different?\nAnd so one way you\nmight think about this\nis again, connecting faces\nto social perception.\nSo there are some\nfaces out there\nthat are not really faces.\nAnd so the faces of dolls\nare just one example.\nSo physically they are\nfaces but you can actually\ntell that they are not\nreally real, they're agents.\nAnd people like Thalia Wheatley\nare wondering about questions\nlike why dolls are creepy.\nSo there is an\nexpectation that the face\nshould belong to a real agent.\nAnd there are different\nclues that can give it away.\nSo if the face is on top\nof a body, more likely\nit's an agent just like\nan artificial stimulus."],

displays.\nI showed the Tonkin\nmacaques and Clark\nFisher was an M.D. PhD student\nin the lab was actually\naddressing this question.\nAnd so he made movies\nlike this one here.\nLuckily there's no

different.\nSo is it really about motion or\nis it just about the content?\nIf you just show a picture\nevery one second you can say,\nwell, there's less\ncontent there,\ntherefore you might have\nmore adaptation, therefore\nless response across the board.\nIs it about update frequency?\nYou know, a fast update\nversus a slow update.\nSo what Clark did, he was\ncreating another

he\nfinds is actually\nsomething where the face areas\nare qualitatively different.\nHe finds two face\nareas here which\nare responding more\nto the natural motion\nthan unscrambled motion,\nand three face areas\nthat are responding more\nto the scrambled motion\nthan the natural motion.\nSo they shift\nopposite preferences.\nWhat we think is\ngoing in the areas\nhere that remember also
