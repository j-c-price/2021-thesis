ENDELEMENTThe Social Intelligence Hypothesis

We do not know whether social intelligence is primate-specific.

— social complexity could be high in other species that live in
complex societies comprised of multiple families and stable
dominance hierarchies like dolphins (Tursiops truncates),
elephants (Loxodonta africana), spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta).
Maybe these individuals, too, recognize and monitor other
individuals' social relationships?

Are primate societies more complex than those of other taxa?

Within the primate order, social learning, innovation, and tool
use are strongly correlated with brain size, not group size
(Reader 2003):

— Chimpanzees, orangutans, and capuchin monkeys have larger
brains than other primates and use and manufacture tools more
routinely than monkeys, but live in relatively small groups. Indeed,
orangutans are frequently solitary.

— Thus tool use and behavioral flexibility, not the complexity of
social groups might have driven brain evolution in primates.

Is it knowledge or just extensive associations?

Relationships can change fast

no single behavioral metric is necessary or sufficient to
recognize associations like matrilineal kin (human

observer using counts of aggressive or grooming behavior
cannot infer relationships)

Social relationships like friendship are intransitive,
others like family-relationships are non-associative
