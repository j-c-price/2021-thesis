# 2021-thesis

0_data has all the raw data from the project (bar some fixed manual alignment in the 2_pipeline folder). 
This mainly consists of lecture slides, lecture recordings and srt (subtitle) files for lectures and conferences. 

In the 1_code section there should be no data but code, which if the main function is run (or modified to the data needed and run) the content or majority of the content in 2_pipeline should be created. 

The fixedAlign.txt files take the automatic alignment and I have manually updated them - this is not autogenerated and therefore is part of the GitHub repo.
